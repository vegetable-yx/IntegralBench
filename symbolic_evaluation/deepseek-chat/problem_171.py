Based on the requirements, since the provided analytical expression is the integral itself rather than a closed-form solution, it does not meet the criteria for direct computation. The expression contains no resolvable closed-form components that can be evaluated without numerical integration, which is prohibited by the instructions. Therefore, we classify this as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
