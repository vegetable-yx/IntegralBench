Based on the requirements, I've determined that the given integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x))  dx\) **does not have a simple closed-form solution**. This is evident because the analytical expression wasn't provided in a computable mathematical form, and the integrand involves a transcendental composition that doesn't yield to elementary functions or standard special functions.

Therefore, I'll generate the code for the invalid case as specified in STEP 1:

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
