Based on the provided integral expression and the requirements, the integral does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. The expression involves a combination of square roots and a cosine function with a composite argument, which typically requires numerical integration methods. However, the requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration (mpmath.quad) and mandate using only direct mpmath calculations for valid closed-form solutions. Since no such closed-form solution exists for this integral, we follow the validity check step.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
