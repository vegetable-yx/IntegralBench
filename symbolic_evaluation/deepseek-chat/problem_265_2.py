The provided analytical answer is the integral expression itself, which does not represent a simple closed-form solution. According to the validity check criteria, since the expression cannot be directly evaluated without numerical integration and does not match any predefined invalid text patterns, it is treated as invalid due to the absence of a computable closed-form solution.
