The integral \(\int_0^1 (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) \cdot \sqrt{2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6} \, dx\) does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be expressed in elementary functions. The analytical solution involves complex expressions that are not easily computable in a straightforward manner. Therefore, based on the validity check criteria, the solution is invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
