Based on the requirements, the provided LaTeX expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form analytical solution. Since the problem lacks a simplified closed-form expression (and contains no explicit invalid text phrases), we default to Step 1 validity criteria. The absence of a computable expression means we treat this as having no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
