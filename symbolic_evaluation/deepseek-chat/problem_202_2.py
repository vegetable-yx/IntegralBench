Based on the analysis, the integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) dx\) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. The solution involves special functions like Struve and Bessel functions, which are not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, according to STEP 1 (Validity Check), the code for the invalid case is generated.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
