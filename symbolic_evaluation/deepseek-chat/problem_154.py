Based on the requirements, the provided LaTeX expression is the integral itself, not its analytical closed-form solution. Since the problem states that the analytical answer is given, but only the integral expression is provided without a simplified closed-form, this indicates the solution may not have a simple closed-form expression. Therefore, the validity check (STEP 1) applies.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
