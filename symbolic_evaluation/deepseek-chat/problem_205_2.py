The analytical solution for the given integral is not provided in a valid closed-form expression. The integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1/2} \sin\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)}\right) dx\) does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. Therefore, the solution falls under the "invalid" category as per the requirements.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
