The given integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1/2} \sin\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)}\right) dx\) does not have a known simple closed-form solution. The analytical answer was not provided, and standard techniques do not yield an elementary or commonly expressed special function form. Therefore, the requirements for generating direct mpmath code are not met.
