The analytical solution for the integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^3 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos x  dx\) is not provided in the query. Without a valid closed-form expression to evaluate, the integral cannot be computed using direct mpmath calculations as required. Therefore, the code must indicate that no simple closed-form solution exists.
