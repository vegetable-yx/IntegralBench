Based on the requirements, since the given expression is an integral without a provided closed-form solution, we determine it lacks a simple closed-form expression. The requirements specify that if the answer contains no explicit closed-form solution (or is presented as an unevaluated integral), we should treat it as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
