The provided analytical expression is the integral itself, which does not represent a closed-form solution. The integral \(\int_0^1 x^2 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx\) has no simple closed-form solution expressed in standard mathematical functions. Therefore, the validity check (Step 1) applies.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
