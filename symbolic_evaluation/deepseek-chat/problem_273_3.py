The analytical answer for the integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^{2} \arccos x \arctan x  dx\) involves complex special functions and does not have a simple closed-form solution expressible in elementary terms. It requires advanced functions like polylogarithms and elliptic integrals, which are not straightforward to compute directly from a provided analytical expression. Therefore, the solution is deemed invalid for direct mpmath computation without a specific closed-form expression.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
