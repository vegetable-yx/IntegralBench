The provided analytical answer for the integral \(\int_{0}^{a} x^{-1/2} \cosh\left(b \sqrt{x(a - x)}\right) dx\) is missing. Without a closed-form expression to translate into code, we cannot proceed with the numerical evaluation using mpmath. The requirements specify that if the solution is complex or not easily expressed, we should return a pass statement. Since no valid closed-form solution was provided, we handle this as an invalid case.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
