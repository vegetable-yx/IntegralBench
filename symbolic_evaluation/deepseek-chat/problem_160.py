The given integral expression \(\int_{0}^{a} x^{-1/2} \cosh\left(b \sqrt[4]{x(a - x)}\right) dx\) does not have a known simple closed-form solution. The analytical answer provided is the integral itself, which cannot be directly evaluated without numerical integration. Since the problem requires avoiding numerical integration and instead translating a closed-form analytical expression, this integral does not meet the criteria for Step 2 processing. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.
