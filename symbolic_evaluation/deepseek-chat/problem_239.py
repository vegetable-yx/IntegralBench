The analytical expression \(\frac{\pi a}{4}\) is valid and can be numerically evaluated. Since no specific value for \(a\) is provided, we assume \(a = 1\) for computation. The code calculates the expression using mpmath with sufficient precision and outputs the result to 10 decimal places.

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Define the variable a (set to 1 for computation)
a = mp.mpf(1)

# Calculate pi times a
pi_times_a = mp.pi * a

# Divide the result by 4
result = pi_times_a / 4

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
