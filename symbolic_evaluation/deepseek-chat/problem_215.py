Based on the requirements, the analytical expression provided is the integral itself without a simplified closed-form solution. Since no explicit closed-form expression is given (only the integral form), and considering the complexity of the integral involving fractional powers and trigonometric functions of a square root, it qualifies as "no simple closed-form solution" per the criteria.
