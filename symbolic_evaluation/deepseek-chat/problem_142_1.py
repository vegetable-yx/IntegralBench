Based on the analytical solution for the integral \(\int_0^1 \arccos x \cdot I_0(2x) \, dx\), the following Python code computes the result using mpmath. The solution involves modified Bessel and Struve functions, which are directly evaluated without numerical integration.

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Compute modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0 at 2
I0_2 = mp.besseli(0, 2)

# Compute modified Struve function, order 1 at 2
L1_2 = mp.struvel(1, 2)

# Compute modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 1 at 2
I1_2 = mp.besseli(1, 2)

# Compute modified Struve function, order 0 at 2
L0_2 = mp.struvel(0, 2)

# Compute the expression: I0(2)*L1(2) - I1(2)*L0(2)
inner_product = I0_2 * L1_2 - I1_2 * L0_2

# Multiply by Ï€/2 to get the final result
result = (mp.pi / 2) * inner_product

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
