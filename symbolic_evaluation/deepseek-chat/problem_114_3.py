The analytical expression for the integral was not provided in a closed form suitable for direct computation. The given expression is the integral itself, which indicates that the solution might not have a simple closed-form representation. Therefore, the code generation process identifies this as an invalid case where no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
