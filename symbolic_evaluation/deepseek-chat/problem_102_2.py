The given integral does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, which indicates that it cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions or common special functions without an explicit solution. Therefore, the validity check from STEP 1 applies, and we generate the corresponding code.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
