Based on the provided information, the analytical expression given is the integral itself, which does not constitute a simple closed-form solution. The integral involves a singularity and a special function, but no explicit closed-form expression (like a combination of elementary functions, gamma functions, Bessel functions, etc.) is provided for evaluation. Therefore, we classify this as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
