The analytical answer provided is the integral expression itself, which does not represent a simplified closed-form solution. Since the expression contains only the integral and no explicit closed-form simplification, it falls under the category of "no simple closed-form solution" as per the validity check criteria. Therefore, the code outputs `pass` to indicate that a direct numerical evaluation from an analytical expression is not feasible.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
