The given analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. The integral involves the Struve function and elliptic integral, which typically do not yield a simple closed-form solution. Therefore, we classify this as an invalid case under the provided criteria.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
