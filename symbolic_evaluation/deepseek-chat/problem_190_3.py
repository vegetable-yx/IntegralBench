The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, which does not represent a closed-form solution. The integral involves a combination of logarithmic, inverse trigonometric, and polynomial terms that do not simplify to a standard closed-form expression using elementary functions or common special functions. After careful consideration, no known closed-form solution exists for this integral that can be expressed in terms of standard mathematical functions without numerical integration. Therefore, following Step 1 of the instructions, we output the pass statement.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
