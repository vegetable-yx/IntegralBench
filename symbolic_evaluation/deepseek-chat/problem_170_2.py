Since the provided analytical expression is the integral itself without a closed-form solution, and based on the requirement to check for phrases indicating no simple closed-form, we generate the code for the invalid case. The integral expression does not match any invalidating phrases, but without an explicit closed-form solution, we cannot proceed with direct mpmath calculations.
