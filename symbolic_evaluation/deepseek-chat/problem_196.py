The given integral does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be directly expressed in terms of elementary functions. After analysis, it is determined that the integral requires special functions or numerical integration for evaluation, which violates the requirement to avoid numerical integration methods. Therefore, the solution falls under the "invalid results" category as per the specified criteria.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
