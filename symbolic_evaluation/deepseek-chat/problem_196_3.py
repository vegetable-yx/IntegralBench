Based on the requirement to check for invalid expressions in the analytical answer and the absence of a provided closed-form solution in the given query, the following decision is made: Since the analytical answer might contain indicators of complexity or lack of a simple closed-form (as no explicit expression was provided to verify), the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
