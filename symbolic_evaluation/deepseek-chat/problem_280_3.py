The given integral \(\int_0^3 x^{-1/4}(3 - x)^{-1/4} \cosh\left(2\sqrt{x(3 - x)}\right) dx\) does not have a known simple closed-form solution expressed in terms of elementary or standard special functions. The analytical answer provided is the integral itself, which indicates that it cannot be expressed in a simple closed form. Therefore, according to the validity check step, we output the code for an invalid result.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
