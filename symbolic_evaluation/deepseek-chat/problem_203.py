The given integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) dx\) does not have a simple closed-form solution. The analytical expression provided is the integral itself without a simplified form, indicating it cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions in a straightforward manner. Therefore, the validity check fails, and the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution.
