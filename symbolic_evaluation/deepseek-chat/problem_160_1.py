The given analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. Since no explicit closed-form solution is provided (e.g., in terms of elementary functions, special functions, or constants), this falls under the "no simple closed-form solution" category. Therefore, the validity check fails, and the code should simply `pass`.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
