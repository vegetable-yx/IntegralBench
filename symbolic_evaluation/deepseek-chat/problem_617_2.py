Based on the provided integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x))  dx\), there is no known simple closed-form solution expressed in terms of elementary or standard special functions. Therefore, the validity check condition is met, and we generate the corresponding code.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
