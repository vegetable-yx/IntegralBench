Since the provided analytical answer is the integral expression itself and not a closed-form solution, and given the complexity of the functions involved (Struve H0 and elliptic K), it is likely that no simple closed-form solution exists. Therefore, we follow Step 1 of the instructions.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
