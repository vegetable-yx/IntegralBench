Based on the given integral expression, it appears that the analytical solution is not provided in a closed-form that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. The expression involves an elliptic integral and complex radicals within the integrand, which typically do not have a simple closed-form solution. Therefore, following STEP 1 of the requirements, we generate the code indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
