Based on the analytical expression provided, which is the integral itself rather than a closed-form solution, we determine that there is no simple closed-form solution available for direct computation. The expression requires numerical integration, but the problem explicitly forbids using `mpmath.quad`. Therefore, we follow the validity check criteria.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
