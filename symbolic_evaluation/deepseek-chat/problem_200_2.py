The integral diverges due to the non-integrable singularity at \(x=2\) where the term \((2-x)^{-1}\) causes the integral to blow up. The integrand remains positive near \(x=2\), confirming divergence to infinity. Since no convergent closed-form solution exists, we follow Step 1 of the instructions.
