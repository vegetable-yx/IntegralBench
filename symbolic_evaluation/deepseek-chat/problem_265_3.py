import mpmath as mp

# Set internal decimal places for intermediate calculations
mp.dps = 15

# Define the integrand function
def integrand(x):
    return x * mp.acos(x) * mp.besselj(1, 2*x)

# Compute the integral numerically using mpmath.quad
# Note: This is a fallback since no analytical expression was provided
result = mp.quad(integrand, [0, 1])

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Important Note:**  
The provided analytical expression was the integral itself `\int_0^1 x \arccos x \, J_1(2x) \, dx`, not its closed-form solution. Since the problem requires a closed-form expression for direct mpmath translation (and no such expression was given), this falls outside STEP 2 requirements. The code above uses numerical integration (`mp.quad`) as a practical fallback to compute the result. If a closed-form solution becomes available, the code can be updated accordingly.
