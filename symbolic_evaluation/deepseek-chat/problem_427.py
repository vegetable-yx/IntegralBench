Based on the requirements, the analytical expression provided for the integral is complex and cannot be easily expressed in a simple closed-form. The integrand involves a polynomial multiplied by the square root of a quartic polynomial, which typically requires elliptic integrals for a closed-form solution. Since the problem states to check for invalid expressions (like "Complex" or "Not easily expressed"), and given the nature of the integral, the solution falls under the invalid category.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
