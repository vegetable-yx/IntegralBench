Based on the requirements, the provided analytical expression is the integral itself without a closed-form solution. The integral form does not meet the criteria for a valid mathematical expression that can be directly evaluated using mpmath functions without numerical integration. Therefore, the validity check fails.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
