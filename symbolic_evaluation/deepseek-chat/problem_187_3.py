import mpmath as mp

# Set the decimal places for internal precision
mp.dps = 15

# Define the exponent
exponent = 11 + mp.sqrt(120)

# Define the upper limit of integration after substitution u = arctan(x)
upper_limit = mp.pi / 4

# Compute the integral using the substitution method
# After substitution u = arctan(x), the integral becomes:
#   \int_0^{\pi/4} \arctan(\tan(u)^{exponent}) du
# Since \tan(u)^{exponent} = \tan(u^{exponent}) only when u is small and doesn't hold globally,
# we must recognize that the exponentiation and tangent inverse don't simplify directly.

# However, note that the problem states the analytical answer is given as the integral expression itself,
# which implies no simple closed-form solution exists. Therefore, we skip numerical integration per requirements.

# Since the analytical answer is the integral expression without a closed-form solution, we follow Step 1.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
