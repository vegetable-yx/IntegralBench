The provided analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. The integral involves a Hermite polynomial and an exponential function with a power term, which typically does not yield a simple closed-form expression. Since no explicit closed-form solution is given and the integral form is inherently complex, it meets the criteria for an invalid result as per the instructions.
