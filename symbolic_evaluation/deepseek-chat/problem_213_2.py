Based on the requirements, the provided analytical expression is the integral itself without a simplified closed-form solution. Since no explicit closed-form expression is given, and the integral contains complex elements like endpoint singularities and trigonometric functions, it does not meet the criteria for direct computation without numerical integration. Therefore, the validity check fails.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
