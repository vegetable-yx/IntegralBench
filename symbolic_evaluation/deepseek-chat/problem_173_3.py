The analytical expression for the integral was not provided in the query. Without the exact closed-form solution, it is not possible to generate valid Python code using mpmath for direct evaluation. The requirements specify that numerical integration should not be used, and only a provided analytical expression can be translated into code. Since no valid analytical expression is available, the integral falls under the "no simple closed-form solution" category.
