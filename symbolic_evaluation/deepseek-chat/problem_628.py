The given analytical expression is the integral itself, which indicates that there is no simple closed-form solution provided. According to the instructions, when the answer does not provide a valid closed-form expression (such as containing only the integral without a simplified result), we should generate the specified code for invalid results.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
