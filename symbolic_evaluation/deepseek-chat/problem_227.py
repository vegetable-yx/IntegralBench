The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, which does not represent a closed-form solution. The problem requires a direct numerical evaluation of a closed-form expression, not numerical integration. Since no simplified closed-form expression is given (such as a combination of known constants or special functions), we classify this as invalid according to the criteria.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
