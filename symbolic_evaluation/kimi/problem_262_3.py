Based on the provided analytical expression `}\frac{\pi}{4}\text{`, which contains LaTeX text formatting (`\text{`) without a complete message and is syntactically invalid, we determine this falls under "similar invalid expressions" according to STEP 1 requirements. The presence of `\text{` without a completed message indicates the solution is not a simple closed-form mathematical expression.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
