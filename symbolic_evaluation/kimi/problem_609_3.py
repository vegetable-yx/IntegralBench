The provided analytical expression is incomplete and contains a trailing `\text{`, indicating potential textual content that may invalidate the expression. Additionally, the series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2k+1}$ diverges to infinity, making numerical evaluation impossible. Following Step 1 of the requirements, we generate the code for an invalid expression.
