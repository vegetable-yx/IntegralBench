Based on the requirements, the given analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. The integral does not provide a direct closed-form expression to compute numerically. Therefore, we proceed with STEP 1 and generate the code indicating no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
