The analytical expression is an integral that can be evaluated using a series expansion. The series representation is derived from the binomial expansion of the integrand, which is valid within the integration limits. The series terms involve the beta function, which is computed using `mpmath.beta`. The series is summed until the terms are smaller than a tolerance of 1e-15, ensuring the result is accurate to at least 10 decimal places.

import mpmath as mp

# Set the internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Initialize the result to zero
result = mp.mpf(0)
# Tolerance for convergence
tol = mp.mpf('1e-15')
# Maximum number of terms to prevent infinite loops
max_terms = 10000
# Start with n=0
n = 0

while n < max_terms:
    # Calculate parameters for the beta function
    a = (n + 1) / 2
    b = (n + 2) / 2
    # Compute the beta function value for the current term
    beta_val = mp.beta(a, b)
    # Multiply by (n+1) to get the series term
    term = (n + 1) * beta_val
    # Add the term to the result
    result += term
    # Check if the term is below the tolerance
    if mp.fabs(term) < tol:
        break
    # Move to the next term
    n += 1

# Print the result with 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
