Based on the validity check, the provided analytical expression contains an integral that cannot be evaluated directly without numerical integration. Since the requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration (mpmath.quad) and the expression lacks a simple closed-form solution, we classify this as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
