The provided analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. Since the integral involves a logarithm and an elliptic integral without a simplified closed-form expression, it meets the criteria for an invalid result (no simple closed-form solution). Therefore, the code outputs a pass statement.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
