import mpmath as mp

mp.dps = 15  # Set internal precision to 15 decimal places

# Calculate ln(2) using mpmath's log function
log2 = mp.log(2)

# Square the natural logarithm of 2
log2_squared = log2 ** 2

# Calculate π squared divided by 12
pi_sq_over_12 = (mp.pi ** 2) / 12

# Compute the difference between squared log2 and π²/12
difference_term = log2_squared - pi_sq_over_12

# Multiply by π/16 to get the final result
result = (mp.pi / 16) * difference_term

# Print the result with 10 decimal places precision
