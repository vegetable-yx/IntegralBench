The provided analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for direct computation without numerical integration. Since the requirements specify avoiding numerical integration and translating a closed-form expression, the solution is invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
