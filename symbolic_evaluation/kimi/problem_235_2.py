Based on the provided analytical expression being an integral without a known closed-form solution in terms of standard mathematical functions, we determine that it does not meet the validity criteria for direct mpmath evaluation. The expression requires numerical integration, which is explicitly prohibited by the requirements. Therefore, we generate the code for invalid results.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
