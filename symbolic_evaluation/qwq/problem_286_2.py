import mpmath as mp

mp.dps = 15  # Set internal precision to 15 decimal places

# Calculate pi squared
pi_squared = mp.pi ** 2

# Calculate natural logarithm of 2
ln2 = mp.log(2)

# Compute the term (ln2 - 1/2)
log_term = ln2 - 0.5

# Multiply pi squared with the logarithmic term
product = pi_squared * log_term

# Divide by 16 to get the final result
result = product / 16

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
