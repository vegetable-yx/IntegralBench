The provided analytical answer states that the integral evaluates to a combination of elliptic integrals without simplification, but it does not include the specific mathematical expression required for computation. Since the exact LaTeX expression is missing and the description indicates no simple closed-form solution is provided, the result is considered invalid for direct numerical evaluation.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
