import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Calculate pi squared
pi_sq = mp.pi**2

# Calculate natural logarithm of 2
ln2 = mp.log(2)

# Square the logarithm of 2
ln2_sq = ln2**2

# Compute 12 times the squared logarithm term
term2 = 12 * ln2_sq

# Sum pi squared and the logarithmic term
numerator = pi_sq + term2

# Divide by 48 to get the final result
result = numerator / 48

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
