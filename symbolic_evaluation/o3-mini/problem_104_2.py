The expression $E(\arcsin(1/4),4)$ represents the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind with amplitude $\phi = \arcsin(1/4)$ and parameter $m=4$. Since $m=4 > 1$, this results in a complex-valued expression. The analytical expression does not contain text explicitly indicating complexity, but mathematical analysis confirms the result is complex. Given the requirement to output a single floating-point number (real-valued), this expression is considered invalid for real-valued numerical evaluation.
