The analytical answer provided is the integer 113. Since this is a valid mathematical expression and not a complex or undefined result, we can directly represent it as a floating-point number using mpmath. The code sets the internal precision to 15 decimal places and evaluates the expression. The result is printed with exactly 10 decimal places using `mp.nstr`.

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# The analytical answer is the integer 113
result = mp.mpf(113)

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
