import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Define the variables a and b (using example values since not specified)
# Replace these with actual values as needed
a = mp.mpf('1.0')
b = mp.mpf('1.0')

# Calculate the argument for the Bessel function: (a*b)/2
arg = a * b / 2

# Compute the modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0
bessel_val = mp.besseli(0, arg)

# Multiply by Ï€ to get the final result
result = mp.pi * bessel_val

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Note:** The code uses example values `a=1.0` and `b=1.0` since no specific values were provided. Replace these with your actual values for `a` and `b` before running. The output is a single floating-point number formatted to 10 decimal places.
