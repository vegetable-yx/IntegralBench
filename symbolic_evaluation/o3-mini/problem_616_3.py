import mpmath as mp

# Set internal decimal precision to 15 for accurate calculations
mp.dps = 15

# Calculate ln(2) using mpmath
ln2 = mp.log(2)

# Square the result of ln(2)
ln2_squared = ln2 ** 2

# Divide the squared term by 4
term1 = ln2_squared / 4

# Calculate pi squared
pi_squared = mp.pi ** 2

# Divide pi squared by 48
term2 = pi_squared / 48

# Sum the two terms to get the final result
result = term1 + term2

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))
