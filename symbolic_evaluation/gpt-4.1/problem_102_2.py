import mpmath as mp

# Set precision to 15 decimal places for internal calculations
mp.dps = 15

# The analytical expression for the integral is not provided in a simple closed form
# Based on the problem statement, we check for invalid expressions in the answer
# Since the given expression is the integral itself and not a closed-form solution,
# we consider it invalid for direct mpmath translation without a closed-form

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
