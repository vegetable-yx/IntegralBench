The analytical expression provided is an integral that includes the Dawson integral function \(\mathbf{D}(u)\). Since the expression requires numerical integration and the problem explicitly forbids using `mpmath.quad` or any numerical integration methods, there is no direct closed-form solution that can be computed using elementary functions or standard special functions without integration. Therefore, the expression is considered invalid for the given requirements.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
