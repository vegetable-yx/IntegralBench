The analytical expression provided is an integral that does not have a known simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. Since the requirement is to avoid numerical integration and instead use direct mpmath calculations, this expression cannot be evaluated without resorting to numerical quadrature. Therefore, it falls under the category of "no simple closed-form solution".
