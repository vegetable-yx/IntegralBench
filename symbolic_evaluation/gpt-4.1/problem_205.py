The given analytical expression is an integral that cannot be evaluated using elementary functions or standard special functions without numerical integration. Since the problem explicitly forbids using numerical integration (`mpmath.quad`), and no closed-form solution is provided, this falls under the "no simple closed-form solution" category.
