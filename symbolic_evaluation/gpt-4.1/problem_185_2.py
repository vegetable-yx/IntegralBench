The given analytical expression contains an integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution. Since the expression requires numerical integration for evaluation (which is explicitly prohibited by the problem constraints), it falls under the category of "no simple closed-form solution". Therefore, the validity check fails and the code outputs a placeholder indicating the expression cannot be evaluated directly.
