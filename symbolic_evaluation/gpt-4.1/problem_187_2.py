The given analytical expression is an identity that relates the integral to another integral with a reciprocal exponent, but it does not provide a simple closed-form solution. The expression involves an integral on both sides, which indicates that numerical integration would be required to evaluate it directly. However, the problem explicitly forbids using numerical integration methods like `mpmath.quad`. Since the analytical answer does not reduce to a closed-form expression and requires further integration, it falls under the category of "no simple closed-form solution" as per the validity check criteria.

Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating that no simple closed-form solution is available.
