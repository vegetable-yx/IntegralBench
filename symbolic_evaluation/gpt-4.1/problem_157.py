The given expression is an integral without a closed-form solution provided. Since the analytical answer is presented as an integral expression and not a computable closed-form, it meets the criteria for an invalid result as per STEP 1. The requirements specify that numerical integration should not be used, and direct computation of the integral is not feasible without a closed-form expression. Therefore, the code outputs the invalid result indicator.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
