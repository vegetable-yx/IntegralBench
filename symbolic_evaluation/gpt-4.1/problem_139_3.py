The given analytical expression is an integral that requires numerical integration for evaluation. However, the problem explicitly prohibits using numerical integration methods like `mpmath.quad`. Since there is no known closed-form solution for this integral that can be expressed in terms of standard mathematical functions without integration, the expression is considered invalid according to the criteria. The solution outputs a placeholder `pass` statement.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
