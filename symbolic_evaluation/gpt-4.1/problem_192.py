The provided analytical expression is the integral itself, which does not represent a closed-form solution. Since no closed-form expression is given, and the integral form cannot be directly evaluated without numerical integration (which is prohibited by the requirements), this case falls under the "invalid expression" category.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
