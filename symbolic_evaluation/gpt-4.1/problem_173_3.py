The given integral \(\int_0^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} \cdot \arcsin^2(0.5x)  dx\) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions that can be directly evaluated using `mpmath` without numerical integration. The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, which is not a closed-form solution. Therefore, the requirement for Step 1 (Validity Check) is met, indicating that no simple closed-form solution exists.
