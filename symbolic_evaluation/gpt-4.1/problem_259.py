The given analytical expression involves definite integrals that can be expressed in terms of special functions available in mpmath. Specifically:
- The integral \(\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin(\sin\theta)  d\theta\) is represented as \(\frac{\pi}{2} \mathbf{H}_0(1)\) using the Struve function.
- The integral \(\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin\theta \cos(\sin\theta)  d\theta\) is represented as \(\frac{\pi}{2} [I_0(1) - \mathbf{L}_0(1)]\) using the modified Bessel function and modified Struve function.

The expression is computed by combining these special functions with the trigonometric terms and scaling by \(\pi\).
