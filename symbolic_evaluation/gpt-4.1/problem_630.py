# Compute the first term: (π / (12√3)) * ln(3)
pi = mp.pi
ln3 = mp.log(3)
sqrt3 = mp.sqrt(3)
denominator = 12 * sqrt3
first_term = (pi * ln3) / denominator

# The integral term is known to be zero by symmetry
# ∫_{π/6}^{π/3} ln(tanθ) dθ = 0 due to antisymmetry about θ=π/4

# Compute the second term: (1/√3) * integral_value
second_term = (1 / sqrt3) * integral_value

# Sum the terms
result = first_term + second_term

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
