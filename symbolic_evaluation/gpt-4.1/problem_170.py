The given analytical expression involves an integral that cannot be evaluated without numerical integration. Since the problem explicitly forbids using `mpmath.quad` and requires direct computation of a closed-form expression, this integral does not meet the validity criteria. The expression remains in integral form and cannot be broken down into elementary functions or standard special functions that `mpmath` can compute directly without integration.
