Based on the requirements, the analytical answer for this integral is not provided in the query. Since we cannot verify a valid closed-form solution and the problem statement doesn't include an explicit analytical expression, we follow Step 1 of the instructions. The integral appears non-trivial and likely has no simple closed-form solution.
