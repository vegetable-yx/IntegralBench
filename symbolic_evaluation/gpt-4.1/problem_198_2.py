The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution. It involves a complex integrand with trigonometric functions and a composition that cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. Since the expression cannot be evaluated using direct mpmath calculations without numerical integration (which is prohibited by the requirements), it falls under the category of invalid expressions as specified in Step 1.
