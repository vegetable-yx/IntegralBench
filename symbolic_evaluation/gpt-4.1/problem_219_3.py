The given analytical expression is an integral: \(\sqrt{2} \int_0^\pi \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) \cos\left(1 \sqrt{\sin \phi}\right) d\phi\). Since it involves an integral without a closed-form solution in terms of elementary or standard special functions, it cannot be directly evaluated using simple mpmath expressions. The requirements specify avoiding numerical integration (mpmath.quad) and translating only closed-form expressions. Therefore, this expression is treated as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
