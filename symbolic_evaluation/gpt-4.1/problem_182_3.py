The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution expressible in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions without numerical integration. Since the requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration (mpmath.quad) and the expression cannot be directly translated into a closed-form using mpmath functions, it is considered invalid under the specified criteria.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
