Based on the validity check step, the analytical answer "G" does not contain any of the invalid phrases listed (such as "\\text{Exact solution is complex}", etc.). However, "G" alone is not a computable mathematical expression. It appears to be either a placeholder or an undefined constant. Since we cannot compute a numerical value from an undefined symbol "G", we treat this as an invalid case for numerical evaluation.
