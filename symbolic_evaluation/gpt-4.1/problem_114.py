The given analytical expression involves definite integrals that cannot be evaluated to a simple closed-form solution using standard mathematical functions. Since the requirement forbids numerical integration and no closed-form representation is provided, the expression is considered invalid for direct computation with mpmath functions. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
