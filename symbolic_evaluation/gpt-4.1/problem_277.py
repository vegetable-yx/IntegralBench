To compute the given analytical expression \(\frac{a^2 \pi}{8} \left[ I_0\left(\frac{ba}{2}\right) - I_2\left(\frac{ba}{2}\right) \right]\) using `mpmath`, we translate the expression into direct calculations. The solution involves modified Bessel functions of the first kind, which are available in `mpmath` as `besseli`. The code below assumes that the variables `a` and `b` are predefined numerical values. It sets the internal precision to 15 decimal places, computes intermediate values for clarity, and outputs the final result to 10 decimal places.

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal decimal precision to 15
mp.dps = 15

# Calculate the argument for the Bessel functions: (b * a) / 2
arg = (b * a) / 2

# Compute the modified Bessel functions of the first kind at orders 0 and 2
I0 = mp.besseli(0, arg)
I2 = mp.besseli(2, arg)

# Compute the difference: I0 - I2
diff = I0 - I2

# Compute the prefactor: (a^2 * pi) / 8
prefactor = (a**2 * mp.pi) / 8

# Multiply prefactor by the Bessel function difference
result = prefactor * diff

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Note:** This code expects `a` and `b` to be predefined numerical values. If they are not set, the code will raise an error. Ensure `a` and `b` are assigned appropriate numerical values before executing this code.
