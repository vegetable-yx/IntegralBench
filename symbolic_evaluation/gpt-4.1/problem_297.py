The analytical answer provided is the integral expression itself, which does not constitute a closed-form solution. Since the expression cannot be evaluated directly without numerical integration (which is prohibited by the requirements), and it matches the condition of having no simple closed-form solution, we generate the validity check code.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
