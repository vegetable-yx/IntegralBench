The given analytical expression is an infinite series: \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\binom{2n}{n}}{(2n+1)^3 16^n}\). This is not a simple closed-form solution as it does not provide a finite expression in terms of known mathematical constants or functions. Instead, it remains as an infinite series, which does not meet the criteria for a valid closed-form expression required for direct numerical evaluation using mpmath functions. Therefore, the appropriate response is to indicate that no simple closed-form solution exists.
