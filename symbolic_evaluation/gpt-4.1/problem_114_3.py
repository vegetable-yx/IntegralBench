The given analytical expression is an integral without a provided closed-form solution. Since the requirements specify that code should only be generated if a valid closed-form expression is given, and the integral itself does not constitute a computable closed-form expression, the solution is deemed invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
