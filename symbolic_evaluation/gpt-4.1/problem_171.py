The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a known simple closed-form solution. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated directly without numerical integration. According to the requirements, since the expression involves an integral and cannot be translated into a direct mpmath calculation without using numerical integration, we output the code for an invalid result.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
