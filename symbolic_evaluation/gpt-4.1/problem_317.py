The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution. It involves an improper integral with singularities at the endpoints and cannot be evaluated directly without numerical integration. According to the requirements, numerical integration using `mpmath.quad` is not allowed. Therefore, the expression is considered invalid for direct mpmath calculations as per the specified constraints.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
