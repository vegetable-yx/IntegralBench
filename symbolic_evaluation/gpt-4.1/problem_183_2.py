The given analytical answer is an integral expression without a closed-form solution that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. Since the expression requires numerical integration (which is explicitly prohibited) and does not simplify to a closed-form, it falls under the "invalid" category as per the instructions.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
