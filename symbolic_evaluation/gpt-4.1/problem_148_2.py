**Reasoning:**
The given analytical expression is an integral without a closed-form solution provided. The problem states that if the answer contains phrases indicating no simple closed-form solution, we should output a specific pass statement. Since the input is only the integral expression (which implies no closed form is available or provided) and does not contain a computable closed-form expression, we treat it as invalid.

**Final Code:**
# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
