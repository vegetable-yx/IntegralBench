The given analytical expression is an integral without a known closed-form solution. According to Step 1 of the requirements, expressions that cannot be directly computed without numerical integration are considered invalid. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
