The given analytical expression contains an integral that cannot be evaluated without numerical integration. Since the requirements explicitly forbid using `mpmath.quad` or any other numerical integration method, and no closed-form solution is provided for the integral, the expression is considered invalid under the criteria. The presence of the integral indicates there is no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
