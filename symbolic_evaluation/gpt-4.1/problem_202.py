The given analytical answer is an integral expression without a closed-form solution. Since the expression does not provide a simplified closed-form and requires numerical integration for evaluation, it falls under the category of "no simple closed-form solution." The requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration (`mpmath.quad`), and direct mpmath calculations cannot be applied here. Therefore, the validity check indicates an invalid expression.
