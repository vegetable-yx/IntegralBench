The given analytical expression is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. Since no simplified closed-form expression is provided (like gamma functions, elliptic integrals, etc.), and the problem requires using only direct mpmath calculations (not numerical integration), this falls under the "invalid" category as per Step 1.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
