Based on the analysis of the given expression, the integral contains the undefined function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\). Since the definition of \(\mathbf{D}\) is not provided in the problem statement and it does not correspond to any standard special function listed in the mpmath documentation or the critical function names specified, this expression cannot be evaluated as a valid closed-form solution. The presence of an undefined function makes the expression invalid for direct numerical computation using mpmath.

Therefore, the required Python code is:

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
pass
