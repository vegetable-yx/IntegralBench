To evaluate the given analytical expression, we compute the integral by breaking it down into three parts as specified. The first part is a direct multiplication, while the other two parts involve intermediate integrals. Using mpmath's special functions, we compute the Clausen functions and the Riemann zeta function to evaluate these integrals accurately. The result is printed to 10 decimal places.

import mpmath as mp

# Set precision to 15 decimal places for internal calculations
mp.dps = 15

# Step 1: Compute term1 = (ln 2)^2 * (π/6)
term1 = (mp.ln(2) ** 2) * (mp.pi / 6)

# Step 2: Compute I1 = ∫_0^{π/6} ln(sin θ) dθ
# I1 = - (π/6) * ln(2) - (1/2) * Cl_2(π/3)
I1 = - (mp.pi / 6) * mp.ln(2) - (1/2) * mp.clsin(2, mp.pi / 3)

# Step 3: Compute I2 = ∫_0^{π/6} ln^2(sin θ) dθ
# Using known closed-form expression in terms of special functions
I2 = (1/24) * (
    mp.pi ** 3 +
    6 * mp.pi * (mp.ln(2) ** 2) +
    12 * mp.ln(2) * mp.clsin(2, mp.pi / 3) -
    12 * mp.clsin(3, mp.pi / 3) -
    12 * mp.zeta(3)
)

# Step 4: Compute term2 = 2 * ln(2) * I1
term2 = 2 * mp.ln(2) * I1

# Step 5: The analytical expression is term1 + term2 + I2
result = term1 + term2 + I2

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, 10))
