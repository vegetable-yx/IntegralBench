The analytical expression provided contains integrals that cannot be evaluated using closed-form expressions with standard mathematical functions. Since the requirements specify avoiding numerical integration and relying solely on direct mpmath calculations, this expression does not meet the criteria for a valid, computable closed-form solution. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
