The given analytical expression involves a definite integral that cannot be evaluated to a simple closed-form solution using standard mathematical functions without numerical integration. Since the requirements explicitly forbid using `mpmath.quad` for numerical integration and the expression lacks a closed-form representation, it falls under the "invalid" category as per STEP 1.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
