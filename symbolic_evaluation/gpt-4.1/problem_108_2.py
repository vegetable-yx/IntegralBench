The given analytical expression is an integral that requires numerical integration for evaluation. Since the problem explicitly forbids the use of numerical integration methods like `mpmath.quad` and no closed-form solution is provided, the expression is considered invalid according to Step 1 criteria. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
