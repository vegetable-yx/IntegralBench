Based on the requirements and the given integral expression, which does not provide a simplified closed-form solution but presents an integral form, the evaluation falls under the "no simple closed-form solution" category. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating the result cannot be computed directly from a closed-form expression.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
