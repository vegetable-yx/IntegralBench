The given analytical expression involves an integral that cannot be directly computed without numerical integration. However, the problem requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration methods like `mpmath.quad` and mandate translating a closed-form analytical expression into direct `mpmath` calculations. Since the provided expression contains an integral and no closed-form solution is evident or provided, it falls under the category of "not easily expressed" or similar invalid expressions as per Step 1. Therefore, the code outputs a placeholder indicating the absence of a simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
