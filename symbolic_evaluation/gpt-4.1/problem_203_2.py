The given analytical expression is an integral without a provided closed-form solution. Since the problem requires avoiding numerical integration and translating the analytical answer into direct mpmath calculations, but no closed-form expression is available, the integral cannot be computed using the specified requirements. Therefore, the validity check indicates that this expression has no simple closed-form solution.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
