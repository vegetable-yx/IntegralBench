Based on the analytical expression provided as "G", which commonly denotes the Catalan constant in mathematical contexts, we generate the following Python code using mpmath. The Catalan constant is a well-known mathematical constant supported directly in mpmath.

import mpmath as mp

# Set precision to 15 decimal places for internal calculations
mp.dps = 15

# Compute the Catalan constant using mpmath's built-in function
result = mp.catalan

# Print the result formatted to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Important Notes**:  
- The expression "G" is interpreted as the Catalan constant (0.915965594...), a standard mathematical constant.
- This code retrieves the precomputed Catalan constant from mpmath and formats it to 10 decimal places.
- If "G" was intended to represent a different expression (e.g., a variable or unsupported function), this solution may not apply.
