The given analytical expression is an integral without a simplified closed-form solution. Since the requirements specify that numerical integration (mpmath.quad) should not be used, and no closed-form expression is provided for direct computation, the expression is considered invalid for the required code generation approach.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
