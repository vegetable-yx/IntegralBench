The provided analytical expression is the integral itself without a closed-form solution. Following the validity check in STEP 1, the expression does not contain text explicitly indicating invalidity, but the absence of a closed-form solution means it cannot be directly evaluated using symbolic mpmath functions. Therefore, the code handles this case by indicating no simple closed-form solution exists.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
