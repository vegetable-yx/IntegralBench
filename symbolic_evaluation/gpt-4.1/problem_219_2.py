The given analytical expression is an integral without a known closed-form solution. Since the expression does not provide a simplifiable closed-form and requires numerical integration (which is explicitly prohibited by the requirements), it falls under the "no simple closed-form solution" category. Therefore, the validity check fails, and the corresponding code is generated.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
