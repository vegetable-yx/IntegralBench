# Set the internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# The analytical expression is: \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^2 \sin \sqrt{x}  \sin \sqrt{2-x} dx
# However, the analytical expression provided is an integral that cannot be directly computed without numerical integration.
# The problem requires avoiding numerical integration (mp.quad), and we must translate the analytical answer into direct mpmath calculations.
# Since the given expression is an integral and does not have a known closed-form solution that can be expressed in terms of standard mathematical functions without integration, 
# we treat it as invalid based on the requirement of no numerical integration.

# The answer does not contain explicit text like "Complex" or "Not easily expressed", but the provided form is an integral that cannot be evaluated in closed form using standard functions.
# Therefore, we follow Step 1 and mark it as invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
