The given analytical expression contains an integral that cannot be directly computed without numerical integration. Since the problem requirements explicitly forbid using numerical integration (mpmath.quad) and mandate direct mpmath calculations, this expression is considered invalid for our purposes. It does not have a simple closed-form solution that can be evaluated using direct special functions or constants.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
