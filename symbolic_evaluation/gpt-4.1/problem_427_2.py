The given analytical expression includes a definite integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution. Since the expression requires numerical integration for evaluation, which is explicitly prohibited by the problem constraints, it falls under the "invalid" category as described in Step 1 of the requirements. Therefore, we generate the specified code for invalid results.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
