The given analytical expression is an integral: \(\sqrt{2} \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \sin\left(\sqrt{\sin\alpha}\right) d\alpha\). This integral does not have a known closed-form solution that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. Therefore, it cannot be directly computed using symbolic mpmath functions without numerical integration. According to the requirements, such cases must be handled with a validity check.
