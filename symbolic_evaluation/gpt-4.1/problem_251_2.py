The given analytical expression is an integral that does not provide a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. Since the requirement specifies avoiding numerical integration and no closed-form expression is provided, the expression is considered invalid for direct computation.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
