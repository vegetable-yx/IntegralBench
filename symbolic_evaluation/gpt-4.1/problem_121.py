import mpmath as mp

# Set the internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Since the analytical expression is an integral without a known closed-form solution, 
# and we are not allowed to use numerical integration (mpmath.quad), we cannot compute it directly.
# The presence of the integral indicates no simple closed-form solution.
# Therefore, we follow the requirement for invalid results.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
