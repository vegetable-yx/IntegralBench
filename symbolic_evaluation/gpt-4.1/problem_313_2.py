The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, not a closed-form solution. The problem requires a closed-form expression to proceed with the code generation. Since no such expression is provided, and the integral does not yield a simple closed-form solution based on standard mathematical functions, the result is invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
