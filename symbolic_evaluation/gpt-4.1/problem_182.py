The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a known simple closed-form solution. The expression provided is:

\[
2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left( \frac{1}{\sin\theta} - \sin\theta \right) \arctan\left(2\sin\theta\right) d\theta
\]

This integral involves trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions in a combination that does not simplify to elementary functions or standard special functions in a straightforward manner. After careful analysis, it is determined that there is no known closed-form expression for this integral using standard mathematical functions.

Therefore, according to the requirements specified in STEP 1, the code must indicate that there is no simple closed-form solution.
