The given analytical expression is an integral that does not have a simple closed-form solution. Although the expression is mathematically valid, it cannot be evaluated using direct mpmath calculations without numerical integration, which is explicitly prohibited by the requirements. The requirement specifies that if the expression contains certain text indicating no closed-form solution, it should be treated as invalid. While the expression lacks such text, its nature as a non-elementary integral necessitates numerical integration for evaluation, conflicting with the constraints. Therefore, the solution is deemed invalid.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
