Based on the analysis that the provided LaTeX expression \(\text{Involves elliptic integrals}\) indicates a non-computable text description rather than a valid mathematical expression, we implement Step 1's validity check. The presence of explanatory text without a computable closed-form solution triggers the invalid case handling.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
