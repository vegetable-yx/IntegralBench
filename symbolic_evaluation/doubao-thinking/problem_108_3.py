The analytical solution for the given integral is not provided in a closed-form expression that can be directly evaluated using standard mathematical functions. The integral involves the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with a complex argument, and no simple closed-form solution is known. Therefore, the validity check determines that numerical evaluation via the analytical path is not feasible.
