Based on the requirements and the given integral expression, we determine that the provided LaTeX does not represent a closed-form analytical solution but rather the integral itself. Since no explicit closed-form solution is provided (and elliptic integral products often lack elementary closed forms), we follow Step 1 of the instructions.

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
