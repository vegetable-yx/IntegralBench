To solve the given problem, we need to compute the numerical value of the analytical expression \(\frac{2}{a^2}[1 - J_0(a)]\) using Python's mpmath library. The solution involves checking the validity of the expression, setting appropriate precision, handling special cases (like \(a = 0\)), and computing the result to 10 decimal places.

### Approach
1. **Validity Check**: The given expression \(\frac{2}{a^2}[1 - J_0(a)]\) is valid and does not contain any invalid text phrases, so we proceed with numerical computation.
2. **Precision Setting**: Set mpmath's decimal precision to 15 (using `mp.dps = 15`) to ensure accurate intermediate calculations.
3. **Special Case Handling**: If \(a = 0\), the expression is defined by its limit, which evaluates to 0.5. For non-zero \(a\), compute the expression directly.
4. **Bessel Function Calculation**: Use `mp.besselj(0, a)` to compute the Bessel function of the first kind of order 0 at \(a\).
5. **Result Computation**: Compute the expression as \(2 \times (1 - J_0(a)) / a^2\) for non-zero \(a\).
6. **Output**: Format the result to 10 decimal places using `mp.nstr(result, n=10)`.

### Solution Code
import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Define the parameter 'a'. Change this value as needed for different computations.
a = 1.0

# Check if a is zero to avoid division by zero and use the known limit
if a == 0:
    result = mp.mpf('0.5')
else:
    # Compute the Bessel function of the first kind, order 0 at a
    j0 = mp.besselj(0, a)
    # Compute the numerator part: 1 - J0(a)
    numerator = 1 - j0
    # Compute the denominator: a squared
    denom = a**2
    # Compute the full expression: (2 * numerator) / denom
    result = (2 * numerator) / denom

# Print the result formatted to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

### Explanation
1. **Import and Precision**: The mpmath library is imported, and the decimal precision is set to 15 to handle intermediate calculations accurately.
2. **Parameter Setup**: The variable `a` is initialized to 1.0 (modifiable as per user requirements).
3. **Special Case Handling**: If `a` is zero, the result is directly set to 0.5, leveraging the known limit of the expression at \(a = 0\).
4. **Bessel Function Calculation**: For non-zero `a`, the Bessel function \(J_0(a)\) is computed using `mp.besselj(0, a)`.
5. **Expression Evaluation**: The numerator \((1 - J_0(a))\) and denominator \(a^2\) are computed separately. The final result is derived as \((2 \times \text{numerator}) / \text{denom}\).
6. **Output**: The result is printed to 10 decimal places using `mp.nstr`, ensuring the output meets the specified precision requirement.

This approach efficiently handles the computation by leveraging mpmath's high-precision arithmetic and ensures robustness by addressing the special case where \(a = 0\). The code is structured for clarity and maintainability, breaking down complex expressions into manageable steps.
