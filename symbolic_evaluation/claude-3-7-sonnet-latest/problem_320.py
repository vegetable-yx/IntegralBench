To compute the analytical expression \(\frac{2\pi}{a^2}\) numerically, we need to assign a specific value to the variable \(a\) since the expression depends on it. For demonstration, we set \(a = 1.0\). The code uses `mpmath` for high-precision calculations, breaks down the expression into manageable steps, and outputs the result to 10 decimal places.

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal decimal places for precision
mp.dps = 15

# Define the variable 'a' (using a=1.0 for this example)
a = mp.mpf(1.0)

# Compute the denominator: a squared
denominator = a**2

# Compute the numerator: 2 * pi
numerator = 2 * mp.pi

# Calculate the result: numerator divided by denominator
result = numerator / denominator

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Note:** The value of \(a\) is set to `1.0` for this computation. Adjust the value of `a` in the code as needed for other inputs.
