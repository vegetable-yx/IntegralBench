To compute the numerical result of the given analytical expression, we assume the context involves evaluating a definite integral from 0 to Ï€/2. This transforms the expression into a specific numerical value. The solution involves summing terms for odd indices only, as even-indexed terms cancel out.

Here's the Python code using `mpmath` to compute the result to 10 decimal places:

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Initialize the sum
total = mp.mpf(0)

# Sum over odd indices: j from 0 to 49 (k = 2j+1)
for j in range(0, 50):
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(99, 2j+1)
    binom_val = mp.binomial(99, 2*j + 1)
    # Denominator term: 99 - 2j
    denom = 99 - 2*j
    # Add term: binom(99, 2j+1) / (99 - 2j)
    total += binom_val / denom

# Divide by 2^99
result = total / mp.power(2, 99)

# Print the result to 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Explanation:**
1. **Precision Setting:** `mp.dps = 15` ensures all calculations use 15 decimal places internally.
2. **Sum Initialization:** `total` starts at zero to accumulate the sum.
3. **Loop Over Odd Indices:** The loop runs from `j=0` to `j=49` (inclusive), corresponding to `k=1,3,...,99`.
4. **Binomial Coefficient:** `mp.binomial(99, 2*j+1)` computes the binomial term.
5. **Denominator Calculation:** The denominator is `99 - 2*j`.
6. **Term Accumulation:** Each term is added to `total`.
7. **Final Scaling:** The sum is divided by \(2^{99}\) to get the result.
8. **Output:** The result is printed to exactly 10 decimal places using `mp.nstr`.
