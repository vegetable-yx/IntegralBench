To compute the analytical expression \(\frac{1 - J_0(a)}{a^2}\) numerically with high precision using mpmath, we follow these steps:

1. **Import mpmath and set precision**: We use 15 decimal places for internal calculations to ensure the final result is accurate to 10 decimal places.
2. **Define the parameter \(a\)**: We choose \(a = 1.0\) as a specific value for computation. If needed, this value can be adjusted.
3. **Handle the case \(a = 0\)**: The expression is undefined at \(a = 0\), but the limit is known to be \(0.25\). We include a check for this case.
4. **Compute the Bessel function**: For \(a \neq 0\), compute \(J_0(a)\) using mpmath's `besselj` function.
5. **Evaluate the expression**: Calculate the numerator \((1 - J_0(a))\) and the denominator \(a^2\), then divide them.
6. **Output the result**: Print the result formatted to exactly 10 decimal places using `mp.nstr`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above steps:

import mpmath as mp

# Set internal precision to 15 decimal places
mp.dps = 15

# Define the value of 'a' (here chosen as 1.0)
a_val = 1.0
a = mp.mpf(a_val)

# Check for a = 0 to avoid division by zero; use known limit 1/4
if a == 0:
    result = mp.mpf('0.25')
else:
    # Compute the Bessel function of the first kind, order 0
    j0 = mp.besselj(0, a)
    # Numerator: 1 - J_0(a)
    numerator = 1 - j0
    # Denominator: a squared
    denominator = a**2
    # Final result
    result = numerator / denominator

# Print the result to exactly 10 decimal places
print(mp.nstr(result, n=10))

**Note**: The value of \(a\) is set to \(1.0\) in this example. To compute the result for a different value of \(a\), modify the line `a_val = 1.0` accordingly. The code handles \(a = 0\) by returning the limit \(0.25\).
