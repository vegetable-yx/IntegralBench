# User must define the value of 'a' here as a string for exact representation
# Example: to set a=2, replace '1.0' with '2.0'
a_val = mp.mpf('1.0')  # Replace with desired value of a

# Compute the square of a
a_squared = a_val**2

# Calculate the result: Ï€ divided by a squared
result = mp.pi / a_squared
