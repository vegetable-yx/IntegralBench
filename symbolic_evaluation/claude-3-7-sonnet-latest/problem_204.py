# The analytical expression provided is the integral itself, but no closed-form solution was given
# The LaTeX input only shows the integral and an approximate value, without a closed-form expression
# After careful examination, the integral does not have a simple closed-form solution
# Therefore, we trigger the validity check

# Invalid results - no simple closed-form solution
