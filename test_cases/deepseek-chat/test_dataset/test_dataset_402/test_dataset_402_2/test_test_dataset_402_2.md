To solve the definite integral 

\[
\int_1^{\pi/3} \sec(x) \left( \tan(x) \log(x) + \frac{1}{x} \right) \, dx,
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
First, observe that the integrand can be written as:

\[
\sec(x) \tan(x) \log(x) + \frac{\sec(x)}{x}.
\]

This suggests that we might be able to express the integrand as the derivative of some function. Let's consider the function \( \sec(x) \log(x) \). 

Compute its derivative using the product rule:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sec(x) \log(x) \right) = \sec(x) \tan(x) \log(x) + \frac{\sec(x)}{x}.
\]

Notice that this is exactly the integrand. Therefore, the integrand is the derivative of \( \sec(x) \log(x) \).

### Step 2: Compute the Antiderivative
Since the integrand is the derivative of \( \sec(x) \log(x) \), the antiderivative is:

\[
\int \sec(x) \left( \tan(x) \log(x) + \frac{1}{x} \right) \, dx = \sec(x) \log(x) + C,
\]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral
Now, evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds \( x = 1 \) and \( x = \pi/3 \):

\[
\left. \sec(x) \log(x) \right|_{1}^{\pi/3} = \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) - \sec(1) \log(1).
\]

Simplify the expression:

- \( \sec\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \),
- \( \log(1) = 0 \).

Thus, the definite integral evaluates to:

\[
2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) - 0 = 2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Compute the numerical value of \( 2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

\[
2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx 2 \times (-0.046117597) \approx -0.092235194.
\]

However, let's compute it more precisely:

\[
\frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047197551,
\]
\[
\log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx \log(1.047197551) \approx 0.046117597,
\]
\[
2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx 0.092235194.
\]

Wait, there seems to be a sign error here. Actually, \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047197551 \), and \( \log(1.047197551) \approx 0.046117597 \), so:

\[
2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx 2 \times 0.046117597 \approx 0.092235194.
\]

But earlier, I mistakenly wrote \( 2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \approx -0.092235194 \), which is incorrect. The correct numerical approximation is positive.

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \( 2 \log\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \), and the numerical approximation is approximately \( 0.0922351942 \).
