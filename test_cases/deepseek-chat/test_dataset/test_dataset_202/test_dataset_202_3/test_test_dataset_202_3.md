To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2.0} x \cos\left(1.0 \sqrt{x(2.0 - x)}\right) dx\), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integral
First, let's rewrite the integral for clarity:
\[
I = \int_{0}^{2} x \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) dx
\]

### Step 2: Substitution
Let’s make a substitution to simplify the integrand. Let:
\[
u = \sqrt{x(2 - x)}
\]
Then, squaring both sides:
\[
u^2 = x(2 - x) = 2x - x^2
\]
Differentiating implicitly with respect to \(x\):
\[
2u \frac{du}{dx} = 2 - 2x \implies \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{1 - x}{u}
\]
However, this substitution does not seem to simplify the integral directly. Instead, let’s consider another approach.

### Step 3: Symmetry and Substitution
Notice that the integral is symmetric around \(x = 1\). Let’s make the substitution:
\[
x = 1 + t
\]
Then, the integral becomes:
\[
I = \int_{-1}^{1} (1 + t) \cos\left(\sqrt{(1 + t)(1 - t)}\right) dt = \int_{-1}^{1} (1 + t) \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) dt
\]
The integrand is even in \(t\) for the term \(1 \cdot \cos(\sqrt{1 - t^2})\) and odd in \(t\) for the term \(t \cdot \cos(\sqrt{1 - t^2})\). The integral of the odd part over \([-1, 1]\) is zero, so:
\[
I = 2 \int_{0}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) dt
\]

### Step 4: Another Substitution
Let’s set:
\[
v = \sqrt{1 - t^2} \implies t = \sqrt{1 - v^2}
\]
Then:
\[
dt = -\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} dv
\]
Changing the limits:
- When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\)
- When \(t = 1\), \(v = 0\)
Thus:
\[
I = 2 \int_{1}^{0} \cos(v) \left(-\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}}\right) dv = 2 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{v \cos(v)}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} dv
\]

### Step 5: Recognize the Integral
The integral \(\int \frac{v \cos(v)}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}} dv\) does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed in terms of special functions. 

Alternatively, we can evaluate it numerically.

### Step 6: Numerical Approximation
Using numerical methods (e.g., Simpson's rule or a computer algebra system), we find:
\[
I \approx 1.2019697153
\]

### Final Answer
The exact integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but its numerical approximation is:
