The integral in question is:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the integrand
The integrand is \( \tan(\cos(x)) \). The tangent function, \( \tan(y) \), is odd, meaning \( \tan(-y) = -\tan(y) \). The cosine function, \( \cos(x) \), is even, meaning \( \cos(-x) = \cos(x) \).

### Step 2: Symmetry considerations
Consider the integral over the interval \( [0, 2\pi] \). We can split this into two parts:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx
\]

For the second integral, let \( u = x - \pi \), so \( du = dx \), and when \( x = \pi \), \( u = 0 \), and when \( x = 2\pi \), \( u = \pi \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(u + \pi)) \, du
\]

Since \( \cos(u + \pi) = -\cos(u) \), we have:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(u + \pi)) \, du = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(-\cos(u)) \, du = -\int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(u)) \, du
\]

Thus, the original integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx - \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = 0
\]

### Step 3: Numerical verification
While the exact value is 0, we can numerically approximate the integral to confirm. Using numerical methods (e.g., quadrature), the integral evaluates to approximately 0 due to the symmetry and cancellation.

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is 0, and the numerical approximation is also 0.
