To compute the definite integral 

\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution
Let \(x = \sin^2 \theta\). Then \(dx = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta\), and the limits change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(\theta = 0\).
- When \(x = 1\), \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{K}(\cos \theta) \cdot 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Symmetry and Known Integral
The product \(\mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{K}(\cos \theta)\) has a known integral over \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). Specifically, it is known that:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{K}(\cos \theta) \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi^2}{8}.
\]

Thus, the original integral simplifies to:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{8} = \frac{\pi^2}{4}.
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\) is approximately:

\[
\frac{\pi^2}{4} \approx 2.4674011003.
\]

### Final Answer
The exact and numerical results are:
