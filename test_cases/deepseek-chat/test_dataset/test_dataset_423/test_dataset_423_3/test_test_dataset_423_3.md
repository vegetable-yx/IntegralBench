Let's solve the definite integral step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
The integrand is \( e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x \). We can simplify this as follows:
- \( e^{\ln x} = x \) (since \( e^{\ln a} = a \) for \( a > 0 \))
- \( \ln e^x = x \) (since \( \ln e^a = a \) for any \( a \))

Thus, the integrand simplifies to:
\[ e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x = x + x = 2x \]

### Step 2: Compute the Integral
Now, we compute the integral of \( 2x \) from 1 to 10:
\[ \int_{1}^{10} 2x \, dx \]

The antiderivative of \( 2x \) is \( x^2 \), so we evaluate:
\[ \left. x^2 \right|_{1}^{10} = (10)^2 - (1)^2 = 100 - 1 = 99 \]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is 99, so the numerical approximation is also 99.0000000000.
