Let's solve the definite integral step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
The integrand is \( e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x \).

- \( e^{\ln x} = x \) (since \( e^{\ln x} = x \) by the definition of the natural logarithm).
- \( \ln e^x = x \) (since \( \ln e^x = x \) by the property of logarithms).

Thus, the integrand simplifies to:
\[ e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x = x + x = 2x \]

### Step 2: Compute the Integral
Now, we need to compute:
\[ \int_1^{10} 2x \, dx \]

This is a straightforward integral:
\[ \int 2x \, dx = x^2 + C \]

Now, evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 10:
\[ \left. x^2 \right|_{1}^{10} = (10)^2 - (1)^2 = 100 - 1 = 99 \]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is 99, so the numerical approximation is simply:
\[ 99.0000000000 \]
