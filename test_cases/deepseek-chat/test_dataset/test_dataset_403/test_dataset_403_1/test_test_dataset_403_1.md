To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx\), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
First, note that \(\log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log x\). Therefore, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx = \int_0^1 (-\log x)^7 \, dx = (-1)^7 \int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx = -\int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Use a Known Integral Formula
The integral \(\int_0^1 \log^n x \, dx\) is a well-known result. For any non-negative integer \(n\), it can be shown that:
\[
\int_0^1 \log^n x \, dx = (-1)^n n!
\]
This can be derived using integration by parts or by recognizing it as the gamma function evaluated at 1 after a substitution.

For \(n = 7\):
\[
\int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx = (-1)^7 7! = -5040
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Original Integral
Substituting back into our expression:
\[
-\int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx = -(-5040) = 5040
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(5040\). Numerically, this is simply:
\[
5040.0000000000
\]
