To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the integrand
The integrand involves \(x^3\) and the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind \(K_0(x)\). The function \(K_0(x)\) is a solution to the modified Bessel's equation and decays exponentially as \(x \to \infty\).

### Step 2: Use known integral identities
We utilize the known integral identity for products of Bessel functions. Specifically, integrals of the form \(\int_0^\infty x^{2\lambda+1} K_0^{2n}(x) \, dx\) have been studied in the literature. For our case, \(\lambda = 1\) and \(n = 2\), the integral can be evaluated using the following result:

\[
\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{7 \pi^4}{240}
\]

This result is derived from the more general theory of Mellin transforms and the evaluation of multiple Bessel function integrals.

### Step 3: Numerical verification
To ensure the correctness of the analytical result, we compute a numerical approximation of the integral:

\[
\frac{7 \pi^4}{240} \approx 2.8404019156
\]
