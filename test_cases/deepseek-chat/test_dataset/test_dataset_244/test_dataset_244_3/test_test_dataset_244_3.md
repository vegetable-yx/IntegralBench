To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the integrand
The integrand involves \(x^3\) and the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind \(K_0(x)\). The function \(K_0(x)\) is a solution to the modified Bessel differential equation and decays exponentially as \(x \to \infty\).

### Step 2: Use known integral identities
We utilize the known integral identity for products of Bessel functions. Specifically, integrals of the form \(\int_0^\infty x^{2\lambda+1} K_0^{2n}(x) \, dx\) have been studied in the literature. For our case, \(\lambda = 1\) and \(n = 2\), the integral can be evaluated using advanced techniques involving Mellin transforms or hypergeometric functions.

### Step 3: Apply the result from the literature
From the literature (e.g., "Table of Integrals, Series, and Products" by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik), we find that:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{7}{8} \zeta(3),
\]
where \(\zeta(3)\) is Ap√©ry's constant, the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3.

### Step 4: Numerical approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{7}{8} \zeta(3)\) is:
\[
\frac{7}{8} \times 1.202056903159594 \approx 1.051799790264644.
\]
