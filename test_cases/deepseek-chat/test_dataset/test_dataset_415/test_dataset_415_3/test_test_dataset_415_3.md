To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Integrand
The fractional part \(\{x\}\) is periodic with period 1, and for \(x \in [n, n+1)\), \(\{x\} = x - n\), where \(n\) is an integer. Therefore, the integrand \(\{x\}^4\) is also periodic with period 1.

### Step 2: Break the Integral into Periods
The interval \([0, 4]\) can be divided into 4 unit intervals:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^3 \int_n^{n+1} \{x\}^4 \, dx
\]
In each interval \([n, n+1)\), \(\{x\} = x - n\), so:
\[
\int_n^{n+1} \{x\}^4 \, dx = \int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Compute Each Sub-Integral
Let \(u = x - n\), then \(du = dx\), and the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left. \frac{u^5}{5} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
\]
Since this is the same for each \(n\), the total integral is:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = 4 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{4}{5}\), which numerically is:
\[
0.8
\]
