To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the Integrand
The fractional part \(\{x\}\) is periodic with period 1, and for \(x \in [n, n+1)\), \(\{x\} = x - n\). The integral from 0 to 4 can be broken down into the sum of integrals over each integer interval \([n, n+1)\) for \(n = 0, 1, 2, 3\):

\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^3 \int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Compute Each Integral
For each \(n\), the integral \(\int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx\) is the same as \(\int_0^1 t^4 \, dt\) (by substituting \(t = x - n\)):

\[
\int_0^1 t^4 \, dt = \left. \frac{t^5}{5} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Since there are 4 such intervals from 0 to 4:

\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = 4 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{4}{5}\), which numerically is:

\[
\frac{4}{5} = 0.8
\]
