To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the fractional part function
The fractional part of \(x\) is defined as \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the floor function. For \(x \in [0, 4)\), the fractional part \(\{x\}\) cycles every integer interval:
- For \(x \in [0, 1)\), \(\{x\} = x\).
- For \(x \in [1, 2)\), \(\{x\} = x - 1\).
- For \(x \in [2, 3)\), \(\{x\} = x - 2\).
- For \(x \in [3, 4)\), \(\{x\} = x - 3\).

### Step 2: Break the integral into integer intervals
The integral can be split into four integrals over the intervals \([0, 1)\), \([1, 2)\), \([2, 3)\), and \([3, 4)\):
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^4 \, dx + \int_1^2 (x-1)^4 \, dx + \int_2^3 (x-2)^4 \, dx + \int_3^4 (x-3)^4 \, dx.
\]

### Step 3: Compute each integral
Each of these integrals is of the form \(\int_{k}^{k+1} (x - k)^4 \, dx\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\). We compute one and note the others are identical:
\[
\int_{k}^{k+1} (x - k)^4 \, dx = \left. \frac{(x - k)^5}{5} \right|_{x=k}^{x=k+1} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]
Thus, each of the four integrals evaluates to \(\frac{1}{5}\).

### Step 4: Sum the integrals
Adding the four integrals together:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = 4 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{4}{5}\), which numerically is \(0.8\).
