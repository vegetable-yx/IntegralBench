To compute the definite integral 

\[
\int\limits_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) and \(\mathbf{E}(k)\) are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution
Let \( x = \sin^2 \theta \). Then, \( dx = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta \), and the limits change as follows:
- When \( x = 0 \), \( \theta = 0 \).
- When \( x = 1 \), \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{E}(\cos \theta) \cdot 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 2: Symmetry and Known Integral
The product \(\mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{E}(\cos \theta)\) has a known integral over \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). Specifically, using the identity for the integral of products of elliptic integrals, we have:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \mathbf{K}(\sin \theta) \mathbf{E}(\cos \theta) \sin \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

Thus, the original integral simplifies to:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), and its numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:

\[
1.5707963268.
\]
