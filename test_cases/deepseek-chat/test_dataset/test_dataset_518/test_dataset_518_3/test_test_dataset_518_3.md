To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi}\left|\sin(2018x)\right|dx\), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integral
The integrand is \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\). The sine function is periodic with period \(2\pi\), but the absolute value makes the period \(\pi\) because \(\left|\sin(\theta)\right|\) repeats every \(\pi\).

However, the argument of the sine function is \(2018x\), so the period \(T\) of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is:
\[
T = \frac{\pi}{2018}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Periods
The upper limit of integration is \(2018\pi\). The number of complete periods \(N\) in the interval \([0, 2018\pi]\) is:
\[
N = \frac{2018\pi}{T} = \frac{2018\pi}{\pi/2018} = 2018 \times 2018 = 2018^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Integral Over One Period
The integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period \(T = \frac{\pi}{2018}\) is:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2018} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| dx = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^\pi \left|\sin(u)\right| du
\]
where we made the substitution \(u = 2018x\), \(du = 2018 dx\).

The integral \(\int_0^\pi \left|\sin(u)\right| du\) is equal to 2 because \(\sin(u)\) is non-negative on \([0, \pi]\) and \(\int_0^\pi \sin(u) du = 2\).

Thus:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2018} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| dx = \frac{2}{2018}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Total Integral
Since there are \(2018^2\) periods, the total integral is:
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| dx = 2018^2 \times \frac{2}{2018} = 2018 \times 2 = 4036
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is \(4036\). The numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:
\[
4036.0000000000
\]
