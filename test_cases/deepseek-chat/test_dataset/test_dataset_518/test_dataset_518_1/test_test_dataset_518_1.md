To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the integrand
The integrand is \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\). The sine function, \(\sin(2018x)\), has a period of \(\frac{2\pi}{2018} = \frac{\pi}{1009}\). The absolute value of the sine function will have a period of \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\) because the negative parts are mirrored to be positive.

### Step 2: Compute the integral over one period
First, compute the integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period \([0, \frac{\pi}{1009}]\):
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{1009}} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{1009}} \sin(2018x) \, dx
\]
because \(\sin(2018x)\) is non-negative in \([0, \frac{\pi}{1009}]\).

The antiderivative of \(\sin(2018x)\) is \(-\frac{1}{2018} \cos(2018x)\). Evaluating this from \(0\) to \(\frac{\pi}{1009}}\):
\[
-\frac{1}{2018} \left[\cos\left(2018 \cdot \frac{\pi}{1009}\right) - \cos(0)\right] = -\frac{1}{2018} \left[\cos(2\pi) - 1\right] = -\frac{1}{2018} [1 - 1] = 0.
\]
However, this result is incorrect because \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period should be positive. The mistake here is that the integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period is actually:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{1009}} \sin(2018x) \, dx = \left[-\frac{1}{2018} \cos(2018x)\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{1009}} = -\frac{1}{2018} \left[\cos(2\pi) - \cos(0)\right] = -\frac{1}{2018} [1 - 1] = 0.
\]
This suggests that the integral over one full period of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is not zero, but rather the integral over half-periods must be considered. The correct approach is to recognize that the integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one full period of \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\) is the same as the integral of \(\left|\sin(u)\right|\) over \([0, \pi]\) (since the absolute value makes the function symmetric), scaled by the period.

The integral of \(\left|\sin(u)\right|\) over \([0, \pi]\) is:
\[
\int_0^\pi \sin(u) \, du = 2.
\]
Thus, the integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\) is:
\[
\frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integral over the entire interval
The interval \([0, 2018\pi]\) contains \(2018 \times 1009\) periods of \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\), because:
\[
\frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{1009}} = 2018 \times 1009.
\]
However, this is incorrect. The correct number of periods in \([0, 2018\pi]\) is:
\[
\frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{1009}} = 2018 \times 1009.
\]
But this leads to an excessively large number, which is not plausible. The correct approach is to recognize that the period of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\), and the number of full periods in \([0, 2018\pi]\) is:
\[
\frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{1009}} = 2018 \times 1009 = 2036162.
\]
But this seems too large. Alternatively, the period of \(\sin(2018x)\) is \(\frac{2\pi}{2018} = \frac{\pi}{1009}\), and the period of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{1009}\). The number of full periods in \([0, 2018\pi]\) is:
\[
\frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{1009}} = 2018 \times 1009 = 2036162.
\]
This is correct, but the integral over one period is \(\frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}\), so the total integral is:
\[
2036162 \times \frac{1}{1009} = 2018.
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the calculation
A simpler approach is to use the substitution \(u = 2018x\), \(du = 2018 \, dx\), so \(dx = \frac{du}{2018}\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^{2018 \times 2018 \pi} \left|\sin(u)\right| \, du.
\]
However, this seems convoluted. Instead, recognize that the integral of \(\left|\sin(u)\right|\) over any interval of length \(n\pi\) (where \(n\) is an integer) is \(2n\), because each \(\pi\) interval contributes 2. Here, the upper limit is \(2018\pi\), and the substitution \(u = 2018x\) gives:
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^{2018^2 \pi} \left|\sin(u)\right| \, du.
\]
The number of full \(\pi\)-intervals in \(2018^2 \pi\) is \(2018^2\), so the integral is:
\[
\frac{1}{2018} \times 2 \times 2018^2 = 2 \times 2018 = 4036.
\]
But this contradicts the earlier result. The correct approach is to note that the integral of \(\left|\sin(u)\right|\) over \([0, \pi]\) is 2, and the integral over \([0, n\pi]\) is \(2n\). Here, the substitution \(u = 2018x\) gives:
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^{2018 \times 2018 \pi} \left|\sin(u)\right| \, du = \frac{1}{2018} \times 2 \times 2018 = 2.
\]
This is also incorrect. The correct substitution yields:
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^{2018 \times 2018 \pi} \left|\sin(u)\right| \, du.
\]
The upper limit is \(2018^2 \pi\), and the integral of \(\left|\sin(u)\right|\) over \([0, n\pi]\) is \(2 \times \lfloor n \rfloor + (n - \lfloor n \rfloor) \times \text{integral over partial period}\). Since \(2018^2\) is an integer, the integral is:
\[
\frac{1}{2018} \times 2 \times 2018^2 = 2 \times 2018 = 4036.
\]

### Step 5: Final calculation
The correct number of full periods in \([0, 2018\pi]\) for \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is \(2018 \times 1009\), and the integral over one period is \(\frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}\). Thus, the total integral is:
\[
2018 \times 1009 \times \frac{1}{1009} = 2018.
\]
However, this contradicts the substitution method. The correct answer is \(4036\), as derived from the substitution method.

### Step 6: Numerical approximation
The exact answer is \(4036\). The numerical approximation is:
\[
4036.0000000000
\]
