To compute the definite integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} \, dx\), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Integrand
The integrand is \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\). 

- **Symmetry Consideration**: The function \(\sin(x)\) is odd, i.e., \(\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\), and the function \(x^2 + 1\) is even, i.e., \((-x)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1\). Therefore, the integrand \(f(x)\) is odd because it is the product of an odd function and an even function.
  
- **Integral of an Odd Function over Symmetric Limits**: For any odd function \(f(x)\) and symmetric limits \(-a\) to \(a\), the integral evaluates to zero:
  \[
  \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0.
  \]
  Since \(f(x)\) is odd, the integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} \, dx\) is zero.

### Step 2: Verification via Numerical Approximation
For completeness, we can verify this result numerically. However, due to the symmetry and the nature of the integrand, the positive and negative contributions cancel each other out over the symmetric interval, leading to a net integral of zero.

### Step 3: Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is also \(0.0000000000\).
