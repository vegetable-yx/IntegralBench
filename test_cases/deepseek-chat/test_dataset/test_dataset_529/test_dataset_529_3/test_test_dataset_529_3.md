To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx\), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Floor Function Inside the Integral
The floor function \(\lfloor y \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(y\). Here, \(y = 2023\sin(x)\). Since \(\sin(x)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(-2023\) to \(2023\).

### Step 2: Identify the Range Where the Floor Function Changes
The floor function \(\lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor\) changes its value whenever \(2023\sin(x)\) crosses an integer. That is, for each integer \(k\) where \(-2023 \leq k \leq 2023\), there are points \(x\) in \([0, 2\pi]\) such that \(2023\sin(x) = k\). 

However, since \(\sin(x)\) is periodic and symmetric, we can focus on one period and exploit symmetry to simplify the integral.

### Step 3: Exploit Symmetry
The function \(\sin(x)\) is odd and periodic with period \(2\pi\). The floor function \(\lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor\) is also odd because \(\lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil\), and for integer \(k\), \(\lfloor -k \rfloor = -k\). 

But more importantly, the integral over a full period \([0, 2\pi]\) of an odd function is zero. However, the floor function is not odd in the strict sense because \(\lfloor -y \rfloor \neq -\lfloor y \rfloor\) for non-integer \(y\). 

Instead, we can split the integral into two parts over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\), noting that \(\sin(x + \pi) = -\sin(x)\). 

Let \(I = \int_0^{2\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx\). Then:
\[
I = \int_0^{\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx
\]
Using the substitution \(x = t + \pi\) in the second integral:
\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(t + \pi) \rfloor \, dt = \int_0^{\pi} \lfloor -2023\sin(t) \rfloor \, dt
\]
Now, \(\lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil\), so:
\[
I = \int_0^{\pi} \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor \, dx + \int_0^{\pi} -\lceil 2023\sin(x) \rceil \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \left( \lfloor 2023\sin(x) \rfloor - \lceil 2023\sin(x) \rceil \right) \, dx
\]
For non-integer \(y\), \(\lfloor y \rfloor - \lceil y \rceil = -1\). For integer \(y\), \(\lfloor y \rfloor - \lceil y \rceil = 0\). 

Since \(2023\sin(x)\) is an integer only at isolated points (where \(\sin(x) = k/2023\) for integer \(k\)), the set of such points has measure zero in the integral. Therefore:
\[
I = \int_0^{\pi} (-1) \, dx = -\pi
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Verification
For a numerical approximation, we can compute:
\[
I \approx -3.1415926536
\]
