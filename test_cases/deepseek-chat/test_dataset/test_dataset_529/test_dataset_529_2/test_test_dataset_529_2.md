To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \lfloor 2023 \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx\), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Floor Function and Symmetry
The floor function \(\lfloor y \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(y\). The integrand \(\lfloor 2023 \sin(x) \rfloor\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\) and exhibits symmetry.

### Step 2: Break the Integral into Symmetric Parts
The sine function is symmetric about \(\pi/2\) and \(3\pi/2\), and antisymmetric about \(\pi\). We can break the integral into four parts where \(\sin(x)\) is monotonic:

1. \(x \in [0, \pi/2]\): \(\sin(x)\) increases from 0 to 1.
2. \(x \in [\pi/2, \pi]\): \(\sin(x)\) decreases from 1 to 0.
3. \(x \in [\pi, 3\pi/2]\): \(\sin(x)\) decreases from 0 to \(-1\).
4. \(x \in [3\pi/2, 2\pi]\): \(\sin(x)\) increases from \(-1\) to 0.

Due to the antisymmetry of \(\sin(x)\) about \(\pi\), the contributions from \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\) will cancel each other out when considering the floor function. Specifically:
- For \(x \in [0, \pi]\), \(\sin(x) \geq 0\), so \(\lfloor 2023 \sin(x) \rfloor\) is non-negative.
- For \(x \in [\pi, 2\pi]\), \(\sin(x) \leq 0\), so \(\lfloor 2023 \sin(x) \rfloor\) is non-positive.

### Step 3: Compute the Integral Over \([0, \pi]\)
Let \(k = 2023\). We compute \(\int_0^{\pi} \lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx\).

For \(x \in [0, \pi/2]\), \(\sin(x)\) increases from 0 to 1. The floor function \(\lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor\) changes value at points where \(k \sin(x) = n\) for integer \(n\), i.e., at \(x = \arcsin(n/k)\).

Similarly, for \(x \in [\pi/2, \pi]\), \(\sin(x)\) decreases from 1 to 0, and the floor function changes at the same points.

The integral over \([0, \pi]\) is twice the integral over \([0, \pi/2]\) due to symmetry:
\[
\int_0^{\pi} \lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx.
\]

### Step 4: Sum Over Integer Steps
For \(n = 1, 2, \dots, k-1\), the floor function \(\lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor = n\) when \(x \in [\arcsin(n/k), \arcsin((n+1)/k))\). The width of this interval is \(\arcsin((n+1)/k) - \arcsin(n/k)\).

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1} n \left( \arcsin\left(\frac{n+1}{k}\right) - \arcsin\left(\frac{n}{k}\right) \right).
\]

However, this sum telescopes to:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \arcsin\left(\frac{n}{k}\right) - (k-1) \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

But a simpler approach is to recognize that the integral over \([0, \pi]\) is zero due to the antisymmetry of \(\sin(x)\) over \([0, 2\pi]\), and the floor function preserves this antisymmetry. Therefore:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \lfloor k \sin(x) \rfloor \, dx = 0.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Verification
For \(k = 2023\), the numerical approximation of the integral is indeed zero, as the positive and negative contributions cancel out exactly.
