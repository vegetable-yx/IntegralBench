To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) is the fractional part of \(x\) and \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the ceiling function, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Break the Integral into Intervals
The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) changes its value at integer points. For \(x \in [n, n+1)\), where \(n\) is a non-negative integer, \(\lceil x \rceil = n+1\) and \(\{x\} = x - n\). Therefore, the integral can be expressed as a sum over these intervals:

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{1 + (n+1)} \, dx
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
1 + (n+1) = n + 2
\]

So the integral becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 2} \int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^{n+1} \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Change of Variables
Let \(u = x - n\), then \(du = dx\), and the integral becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 2} \int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Inner Integral
The inner integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du = \left. \frac{u^{n+2}}{n+2} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{n+2}
\]

### Step 4: Sum the Series
Now, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 2} \cdot \frac{1}{n + 2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + 2)^2}
\]

This can be rewritten by shifting the index \(k = n + 2\):

\[
\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}
\]

We recognize this as the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the integers starting from 2. The well-known Basel problem gives:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\]

Therefore:

\[
\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\) is approximately:

\[
\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1 \approx 0.6449340668
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\), and its numerical approximation is \(0.6449340668\).
