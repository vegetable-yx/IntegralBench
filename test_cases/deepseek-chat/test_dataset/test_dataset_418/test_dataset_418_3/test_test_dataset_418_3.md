To compute the definite integral 

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx,
\]

where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\) (i.e., \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\)) and \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the ceiling function, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Break the Integral into Intervals
The ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\) changes value at each integer. For \(x \in [n, n+1)\), where \(n \in \mathbb{N}_0\), we have \(\lceil x \rceil = n+1\) and \(\{x\} = x - n\). Thus, the integral can be expressed as a sum over integer intervals:

\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{1 + (n+1)} \, dx.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Integrand
Let \(u = x - n\), then \(du = dx\), and the integral becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n+2} \int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Inner Integral
The inner integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du = \left. \frac{u^{n+2}}{n+2} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{n+2}.
\]

### Step 4: Sum the Series
Substituting back, the integral becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n+2} \cdot \frac{1}{n+2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)^2}.
\]

This is equivalent to:

\[
\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \zeta(2) - 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} - \frac{5}{4},
\]

where \(\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 2, and we subtract the first two terms of the series (\(k=1\) and \(k=2\)).

However, let's correct the summation indices:

The sum \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)^2}\) is actually:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)^2} = \sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \zeta(2) - 1 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1.
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\). Numerically, this evaluates to:

\[
\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1 \approx 0.6449340668.
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\), and its numerical approximation is approximately \(0.6449340668\).
