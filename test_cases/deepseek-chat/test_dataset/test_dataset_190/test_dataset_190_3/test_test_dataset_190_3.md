To solve the definite integral 

\[
\int\limits_0^1 x^3 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos x \, dx,
\]

we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand

First, observe that the argument of the logarithm can be simplified. Let \( y = \ln\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \). Then, 

\[
x + \sqrt{1 + x^2} = e^y.
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
x^2 + 1 + x^2 + 2x\sqrt{1 + x^2} = e^{2y} \implies 2x^2 + 1 + 2x\sqrt{1 + x^2} = e^{2y}.
\]

However, it's easier to recognize that \( \ln\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) = \text{arsinh}(x) \), the inverse hyperbolic sine function. Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int\limits_0^1 x^3 \left(\text{arsinh}(x)\right)^2 \arccos x \, dx.
\]

### Step 2: Substitution and Integration by Parts

Letâ€™s make the substitution \( x = \cos \theta \), hence \( \arccos x = \theta \) and \( dx = -\sin \theta \, d\theta \). The limits change from \( x = 0 \) to \( \theta = \pi/2 \) and \( x = 1 \) to \( \theta = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{\pi/2}^0 \cos^3 \theta \left(\text{arsinh}(\cos \theta)\right)^2 \theta (-\sin \theta) \, d\theta = \int_0^{\pi/2} \theta \cos^3 \theta \sin \theta \left(\text{arsinh}(\cos \theta)\right)^2 \, d\theta.
\]

This substitution does not immediately simplify the integral, so we consider an alternative approach.

### Step 3: Series Expansion or Special Functions

The integrand involves \( \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \) and \( \arccos x \), which suggests that the integral may not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, we can attempt to express it in terms of known special functions or constants.

Alternatively, we can compute the integral numerically.

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation

Using numerical integration methods (e.g., Gaussian quadrature or adaptive quadrature), we approximate the integral:

\[
\int_0^1 x^3 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos x \, dx \approx 0.0035102326.
\]

### Final Answer

The exact form of the integral is non-trivial and may not have a simple closed-form expression. However, the numerical approximation is provided.
