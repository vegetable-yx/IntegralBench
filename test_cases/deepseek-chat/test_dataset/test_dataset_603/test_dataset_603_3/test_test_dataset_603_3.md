To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}}\:\mathrm{d}x\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
The integrand is \(\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}}\). Recall that \(1 - \sin^2(x) = \cos^2(x)\), so the integrand becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{\cos^2(x)}} = \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{\cos^2(x)} = |\cos(x)|\), we must consider the absolute value of \(\cos(x)\).

### Step 2: Exploit Symmetry
The function \(\frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|}\) is periodic with period \(\pi\) and symmetric about \(\pi\). Therefore, we can compute the integral over \([0, \pi]\) and multiply by 2:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \mathrm{d}x = 2 \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x
\]
Here, \(|\cos(x)| = \cos(x)\) on \([0, \pi]\), so the absolute value can be removed.

### Step 3: Compute the Integral
The integral \(\int \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x\) can be evaluated using the substitution \(t = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\):
\[
\int \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \int \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}} \cdot \frac{2}{1 + t^2} \mathrm{d}t = \int \frac{1 + t^2}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{1 + t^2} \mathrm{d}t = \int 1 \mathrm{d}t = t + C = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + C
\]
Evaluating from \(0\) to \(\pi\):
\[
\left. \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right|_0^{\pi} = \lim_{x \to \pi^-} \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) - \tan(0) = \infty - 0 = \infty
\]
However, this suggests the integral diverges, which contradicts the fact that the integrand is bounded and the interval is finite. The issue arises because the substitution \(t = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) is not valid at \(x = \pi\). Instead, we can use an alternative approach.

### Step 4: Alternative Approach Using Trigonometric Identity
Using the identity \(\frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} = \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}\), we rewrite the integral:
\[
\int \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \int \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \int \csc^2(x) \mathrm{d}x - \int \cot(x)\csc(x) \mathrm{d}x = -\cot(x) + \csc(x) + C
\]
Evaluating from \(0\) to \(\pi\):
\[
\left. \left(-\cot(x) + \csc(x)\right) \right|_0^{\pi} = \left[ -\cot(\pi) + \csc(\pi) \right] - \left[ -\cot(0) + \csc(0) \right] = [0 + 0] - [-\infty + \infty]
\]
This also leads to an indeterminate form, indicating that the integral is improper and requires careful handling.

### Step 5: Correct Evaluation
The integral \(\int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x\) is improper at \(x = \pi\). However, the antiderivative \(-\cot(x) + \csc(x)\) can be rewritten as \(\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\), as previously derived. Thus:
\[
\int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \lim_{b \to \pi^-} \left. \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right|_0^b = \lim_{b \to \pi^-} \tan\left(\frac{b}{2}\right) - \tan(0) = \infty - 0 = \infty
\]
This confirms that the integral diverges. However, this contradicts the physical interpretation of the integrand being bounded and the interval being finite. The correct antiderivative is actually:
\[
\int \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \frac{\sin(x)}{1 + \cos(x)} + C
\]
Evaluating from \(0\) to \(\pi\):
\[
\left. \frac{\sin(x)}{1 + \cos(x)} \right|_0^{\pi} = \frac{\sin(\pi)}{1 + \cos(\pi)} - \frac{\sin(0)}{1 + \cos(0)} = \frac{0}{1 - 1} - \frac{0}{1 + 1} = \text{undefined}
\]
The integral is indeed improper, and its principal value must be considered. However, the integral \(\int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x\) is known to diverge.

### Step 6: Re-evaluate the Original Integral
Given the divergence of \(\int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x\), the original integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \mathrm{d}x\) also diverges. However, this contradicts the fact that the integrand is bounded and the interval is finite. The correct approach is to recognize that the integral converges and can be evaluated using symmetry and substitution.

### Step 7: Correct Computation
The integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \mathrm{d}x\) can be split into four integrals over intervals where \(\cos(x)\) is non-negative and non-positive:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \mathrm{d}x = 4 \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x
\]
Using the substitution \(t = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\):
\[
\int \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + C
\]
Evaluating from \(0\) to \(\pi/2\):
\[
\left. \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right|_0^{\pi/2} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \tan(0) = 1 - 0 = 1
\]
Thus:
\[
4 \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \mathrm{d}x = 4 \times 1 = 4
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is \(4\). The numerical approximation is:
\[
4.0000000000
\]
