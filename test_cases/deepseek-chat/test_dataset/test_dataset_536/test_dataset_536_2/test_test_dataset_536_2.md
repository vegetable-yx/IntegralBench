To compute the definite integral \(\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\cos(20x)\sin(25x)\:dx\), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Use a Trigonometric Identity
We can use the product-to-sum identity for \(\cos(A)\sin(B)\):
\[
\cos(A)\sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) - \sin(A - B)]
\]
Applying this with \(A = 20x\) and \(B = 25x\):
\[
\cos(20x)\sin(25x) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(45x) - \sin(-5x)] = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(45x) + \sin(5x)]
\]
since \(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)\).

### Step 2: Integrate Term by Term
Now, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(20x)\sin(25x)\:dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} [\sin(45x) + \sin(5x)]\:dx
\]
We can split this into two integrals:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \sin(45x)\:dx + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \sin(5x)\:dx \right]
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Integral
The integral of \(\sin(kx)\) over a symmetric interval \([-a, a]\) is zero because \(\sin(kx)\) is an odd function. Therefore:
\[
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \sin(45x)\:dx = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \sin(5x)\:dx = 0
\]
Thus, the entire integral evaluates to:
\[
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos(20x)\sin(25x)\:dx = 0
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is \(0\), so the numerical approximation is also \(0\).
