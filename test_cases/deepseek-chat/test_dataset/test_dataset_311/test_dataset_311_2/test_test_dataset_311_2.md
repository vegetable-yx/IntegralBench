To solve the definite integral:

\[
\int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \(u\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integral
The Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) implies that the integrand is non-zero only where \(0.5x = 0\), i.e., at \(x = 0\). However, the lower limit of the integral is \(x = 0\), and the delta function is centered at \(x = 0\). 

The integral of a function \(f(x)\) multiplied by the Dirac delta function \(\delta(x)\) over an interval containing \(x = 0\) is \(f(0)\). Here, the delta function is \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x) = 2\delta(x)\), since \(\delta(ax) = \frac{1}{|a|}\delta(x)\).

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot 2\delta(x) \, dx.
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integrand at \(x = 0\)
The integrand is:

\[
2x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \delta(x).
\]

At \(x = 0\), the term \(\ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) diverges to \(-\infty\), but \(x = 0\) multiplies it, leading to an indeterminate form \(0 \cdot (-\infty)\). However, the limit as \(x \to 0^+\) of \(x \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) can be computed:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right).
\]

Using Taylor expansion for \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}\) near \(x = 0\):

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x} \approx \frac{1 + 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}}{x} = \frac{2 - \frac{x^2}{2}}{x} = \frac{2}{x} - \frac{x}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{x} - \frac{x}{2}\right) \approx \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right) + \ln\left(1 - \frac{x^2}{4}\right) \approx \ln(2) - \ln(x) - \frac{x^2}{4}.
\]

Multiplying by \(x\):

\[
x \ln\left(\frac{2}{x} - \frac{x}{2}\right) \approx x \ln(2) - x \ln(x) - \frac{x^3}{4}.
\]

Taking the limit as \(x \to 0^+\):

\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \left(x \ln(2) - x \ln(x) - \frac{x^3}{4}\right) = 0,
\]

since \(x \ln(x) \to 0\) as \(x \to 0^+\).

### Step 3: Final Evaluation
The integral evaluates to:

\[
2 \cdot \left[ \text{Integrand evaluated at } x = 0 \right] = 2 \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is also \(0\).
