To solve the definite integral 

\[
\int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) is the Dirac delta function, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Dirac Delta Function
The Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) has the property that 

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(u) \mathbf{D}(u - a) \, du = f(a)
\]

if \(a\) is within the integration limits. Here, \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) implies that the delta function is centered at \(x = 0\) (since \(0.5x = 0\) only when \(x = 0\)). However, the integration limits are from \(0\) to \(1.0\), and \(x = 0\) is included. 

But the delta function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) can be rewritten using the scaling property of the delta function:

\[
\mathbf{D}(0.5x) = 2 \mathbf{D}(x).
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot 2 \mathbf{D}(x) \, dx.
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integral with the Delta Function
The delta function \(\mathbf{D}(x)\) is zero everywhere except at \(x = 0\). However, the lower limit of the integral is \(x = 0\), and the integrand at \(x = 0\) is:

\[
x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \bigg|_{x=0}.
\]

This expression is indeterminate at \(x = 0\) because:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln\left(\frac{1 + 1}{x}\right) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right).
\]

Using L'HÃ´pital's rule or recognizing that \(x \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right) \to 0\) as \(x \to 0^+\), the integrand evaluates to \(0\) at \(x = 0\). 

Thus, the integral is:

\[
2 \cdot 0 = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is also \(0\).
