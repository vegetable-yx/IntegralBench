Let's solve the definite integral step by step:

\[
I = \int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Integral
First, note that \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \(0.5x\). However, the Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(x - a)\) is non-zero only at \(x = a\). Here, \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) implies that the argument \(0.5x\) must be zero for the delta function to be non-zero. This occurs at \(x = 0\). 

But the integral is from \(0\) to \(1.0\), and the delta function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) is non-zero only at \(x = 0\). The integral of a function multiplied by the Dirac delta function centered at a point within the limits is the value of the function at that point. However, \(x = 0\) is the lower limit, and the delta function is not fully within the interval (it's at the boundary). 

### Step 2: Evaluate the Delta Function
The Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) can be rewritten as \(2 \mathbf{D}(x)\), since \(\mathbf{D}(ax) = \frac{1}{|a|}\mathbf{D}(x)\). Thus:

\[
\mathbf{D}(0.5x) = 2 \mathbf{D}(x)
\]

Now, the integral becomes:

\[
I = \int_{0}^{1.0} x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot 2 \mathbf{D}(x) \, dx
\]

The delta function \(\mathbf{D}(x)\) is non-zero only at \(x = 0\). However, the integrand at \(x = 0\) is:

\[
x \ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot 2 \mathbf{D}(x)
\]

At \(x = 0\), the term \(\ln\left(\frac{1.0 + \sqrt{1.0 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) diverges to \(-\infty\), but \(x = 0\) makes the product \(x \ln(\cdot)\) an indeterminate form \(0 \cdot (-\infty)\). To resolve this, let's analyze the behavior as \(x \to 0^+\):

\[
x \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \approx x \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right) = x (\ln 2 - \ln x)
\]

As \(x \to 0^+\), \(x \ln x \to 0\), so the integrand behaves like \(x \ln 2 \to 0\). Thus, the integrand is \(0\) at \(x = 0\), and the integral evaluates to \(0\).

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is also \(0.0000000000\).
