To solve the integral \(\int_0^1 |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| \, dx\), we will break it down step by step by analyzing the nested absolute value functions.

### Step 1: Analyze the Innermost Absolute Value
The innermost function is \(|1 - x|\). On the interval \([0, 1]\):
- For \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), \(1 - x \geq 0\), so \(|1 - x| = 1 - x\).

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[ |1 - |1 - x|| = |1 - (1 - x)| = |x| = x \]
(since \(x \geq 0\) on \([0, 1]\)).

### Step 2: Analyze the Next Absolute Value
Now, the expression becomes:
\[ |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| = |1 - x| \]
Again, since \(x \in [0, 1]\), \(|1 - x| = 1 - x\).

### Step 3: Compute the Integral
The integral simplifies to:
\[ \int_0^1 (1 - x) \, dx \]

This is a straightforward integral:
\[ \int_0^1 (1 - x) \, dx = \left[ x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) - (0 - 0) = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is \(\frac{1}{2}\), which numerically is \(0.5\).
