To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx\), where \(\mathbf{E}(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Express the Integral in Terms of Elliptic Integrals
The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{E}(k) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta.
\]
Given the integral:
\[
I = \int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx,
\]
we can use the symmetry and properties of elliptic integrals to simplify it.

### Step 2: Use Known Results for Products of Elliptic Integrals
The product \(\mathbf{E}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-k^2})\) has known integral representations. Specifically, the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{E}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-k^2}) \, dk
\]
has been evaluated in the literature. By a change of variables \(k = \sqrt{x}\), the integral \(I\) can be related to this form.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Integral
Using known results (see, for example, [Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, Table of Integrals, Series, and Products], the integral evaluates to:
\[
I = \frac{4}{3} \left( \mathbf{E}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 - \mathbf{K}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \right),
\]
where \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. However, this can be further simplified using the values of elliptic integrals at \(k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\):
\[
\mathbf{E}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{\pi^{3/2}}{2 \Gamma\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} + \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2}{4\sqrt{2\pi}}, \quad \mathbf{K}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2}{4\sqrt{\pi}}.
\]
Substituting these, we find:
\[
I = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is:
\[
I = \frac{\pi^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Numerically, this evaluates to:
\[
I \approx 2.9348022005.
\]
