To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Integrand
The integrand involves \(x\) multiplied by the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind \(K_0(x)\). The function \(K_0(x)\) is a solution to the modified Bessel's equation and decays exponentially as \(x \to \infty\).

### Step 2: Use Known Integral Results
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx\) is known from the literature on Bessel function integrals. Specifically, it can be evaluated using the following result:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{7}{8} \zeta(3)
\]

where \(\zeta(3)\) is Ap√©ry's constant, the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3.

### Step 3: Verify the Result
This result can be derived using techniques from integral transforms or by relating it to other known integrals involving products of Bessel functions. However, the derivation is non-trivial and often relies on advanced methods in special functions and integral transforms.

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{7}{8} \zeta(3)\). Numerically, \(\zeta(3) \approx 1.2020569032\), so:

\[
\frac{7}{8} \zeta(3) \approx \frac{7}{8} \times 1.2020569032 \approx 1.0518007903
\]
