To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Integrand
The integrand involves the modified Bessel function of the second kind \(K_0(x)\), raised to the fourth power and multiplied by \(x\). The function \(K_0(x)\) is known to decay exponentially as \(x \to \infty\) and has a logarithmic singularity at \(x = 0\).

### Step 2: Use Known Integral Identities
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^n(x) \, dx\) for \(n = 4\) is known in the literature. Specifically, for \(n = 4\), the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{7}{8} \zeta(3)
\]

where \(\zeta(3)\) is Ap√©ry's constant, the value of the Riemann zeta function at 3.

### Step 3: Verification
This result can be derived using techniques from the theory of Bessel functions and Mellin transforms, but the detailed derivation is quite involved and beyond the scope of this explanation. The key is recognizing that the integral fits into a class of integrals that can be evaluated using known identities involving Bessel functions and zeta functions.

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{7}{8} \zeta(3)\). Numerically, \(\zeta(3) \approx 1.2020569032\), so:

\[
\frac{7}{8} \zeta(3) \approx \frac{7}{8} \times 1.2020569032 \approx 1.0518007903
\]
