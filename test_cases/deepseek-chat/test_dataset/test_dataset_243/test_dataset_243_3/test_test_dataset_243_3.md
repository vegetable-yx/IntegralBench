To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Integrand
The integrand involves the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\), raised to the fourth power and multiplied by \(x\). The function \(K_0(x)\) is known to decay exponentially as \(x \to \infty\) and has a logarithmic singularity at \(x = 0\).

### Step 2: Use Known Integral Results
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^n(x) \, dx\) for \(n = 4\) is known from the literature on Bessel function integrals. Specifically, it has been evaluated in the context of multiple Bessel function integrals and is related to certain hypergeometric series or lattice sums.

The exact value of the integral is:
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} x K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{7 \pi^4}{2160}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Verification
To ensure the correctness of the analytical result, we compute a numerical approximation of \(\frac{7 \pi^4}{2160}\):

\[
\frac{7 \pi^4}{2160} \approx 0.3157086149
\]
