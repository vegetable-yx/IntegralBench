To solve the definite integral:

\[
\int_{0}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{(2.0)^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot \mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right) \, dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \(u = 0\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integral
The Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) is zero everywhere except where \(0.5x = 0\), i.e., at \(x = 0\). However, the lower limit of the integral is \(x = 0\), and the Dirac delta function "picks out" the value of the integrand at \(x = 0\).

But we must be careful because the integrand \(\ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) (it tends to \(+\infty\)). This suggests that the integral may not be well-defined in the traditional sense. However, if we interpret the integral as a limit:

\[
\lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \int_{\epsilon}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx,
\]

the contribution from the Dirac delta at \(x = 0\) would still be zero because the integrand is zero for \(x > 0\). Thus, the integral evaluates to zero.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
Since the integral is zero analytically, the numerical approximation is also zero.
