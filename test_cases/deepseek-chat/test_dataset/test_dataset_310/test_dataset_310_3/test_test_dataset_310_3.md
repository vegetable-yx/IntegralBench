To solve the definite integral 

\[
\int_{0}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{(2.0)^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot \mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right) \, dx,
\]

where \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) is the Dirac delta function, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Dirac Delta Function
The Dirac delta function \(\mathbf{D}(u)\) is zero everywhere except at \(u = 0\), where it is infinite, and it satisfies the property:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \mathbf{D}(x - a) \, dx = f(a).
\]

In this problem, \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) implies that the delta function is centered at \(x = 0\) (since \(0.5x = 0\) when \(x = 0\)).

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integral
Given the property of the Dirac delta function, the integral simplifies to evaluating the integrand at \(x = 0\):

\[
\int_{0}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx = \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - 0^2}}{0}\right).
\]

However, the integrand \(\ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) because it approaches \(\ln(\infty)\), which diverges. This suggests that the integral does not converge in the traditional sense.

But let's reconsider the interpretation. If we treat \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) as \(\frac{1}{0.5}\delta(x) = 2\delta(x)\), then the integral becomes:

\[
2 \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - 0^2}}{0}\right),
\]

which still diverges. 

### Step 3: Alternative Interpretation
Alternatively, if the integral is interpreted as a principal value or another generalized function context, the result might be finite. However, under standard definitions, the integral diverges due to the singularity at \(x = 0\).

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Since the integral diverges, a numerical approximation is not meaningful. However, if we consider a small \(\epsilon > 0\) and compute:

\[
\int_{\epsilon}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \cdot \mathbf{D}(0.5x) \, dx,
\]

the result would be zero for \(\epsilon > 0\) because \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\) is zero for \(x \neq 0\). 

### Final Answer
Given the divergence at \(x = 0\), the integral does not converge. However, if we interpret the question differently (e.g., ignoring the delta function's effect), the integral might be considered as zero. But this is not standard.

Given the ambiguity, the most precise answer is that the integral diverges. However, if the delta function is not centered at zero (e.g., if there was a typo and it should be \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x - a)\)), the result would depend on \(a\).

Assuming the original integral is correct and the delta function is \(\mathbf{D}(0.5x)\), the integral diverges. 

But if the integral was meant to be without the delta function, we can compute:

\[
\int_{0}^{2.0} \ln\left(\frac{2.0 + \sqrt{4.0 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx.
\]

This integral can be evaluated as follows:

Let \(x = 2 \sin \theta\), then \(dx = 2 \cos \theta \, d\theta\), and the limits change from \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = \pi/2\). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \ln\left(\frac{2 + 2 \cos \theta}{2 \sin \theta}\right) \cdot 2 \cos \theta \, d\theta = 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \ln\left(\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}\right) \cos \theta \, d\theta.
\]

Simplifying the integrand:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2 \cos^2 (\theta/2)}{2 \sin (\theta/2) \cos (\theta/2)}\right) = \ln\left(\cot (\theta/2)\right).
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \ln\left(\cot (\theta/2)\right) \cos \theta \, d\theta.
\]

This integral evaluates to \(\pi\) (a known result).
