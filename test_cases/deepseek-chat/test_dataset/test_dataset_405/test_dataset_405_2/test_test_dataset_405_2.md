To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we can proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Fractional Part Function
The fractional part of \(x\), denoted \(\{x\}\), is defined as:
\[
\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\)).

### Step 2: Break the Integral into Subintervals
The fractional part function \(\{x\}\) is periodic with period 1. Therefore, we can break the integral into subintervals where \(\{x\}\) behaves linearly. For the interval \([-4, 4]\), we consider the subintervals where \(x\) is between consecutive integers.

However, since \(e^{|x|}\) is symmetric and \(\{x\}\) is periodic, we can simplify the computation by noting that:
\[
\{-x\} = 1 - \{x\} \quad \text{for} \quad x \notin \mathbb{Z}
\]
Thus, we can write the integral as:
\[
\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx = \int_{-4}^0 e^{-x} \cdot \{x\} \, dx + \int_{0}^4 e^{x} \cdot \{x\} \, dx
\]
Using the property \(\{x\} = 1 - \{-x\}\) for \(x \in (0, 4)\), we can rewrite the first integral:
\[
\int_{-4}^0 e^{-x} \cdot \{x\} \, dx = \int_{0}^4 e^{x} \cdot (1 - \{x\}) \, dx
\]
Therefore, the original integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^4 e^{x} \cdot (1 - \{x\}) \, dx + \int_{0}^4 e^{x} \cdot \{x\} \, dx = \int_{0}^4 e^{x} \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Simplified Integral
The integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_{0}^4 e^{x} \, dx = e^{4} - e^{0} = e^{4} - 1
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(e^{4} - 1\) is approximately:
\[
e^{4} - 1 \approx 53.5981500331
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(e^{4} - 1\), and its numerical approximation is \(53.5981500331\).
