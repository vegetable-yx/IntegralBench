The integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx\) does not have a straightforward analytical solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can express it in terms of special functions or provide a numerical approximation.

### Step 1: Attempting an Analytical Solution
Consider the integral:
\[
I = \int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx
\]
We can expand the integrand using the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos(x + \cos x) = \cos x \cos(\cos x) - \sin x \sin(\cos x)
\]
Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
I = \int_0^\pi \cos x \cos(\cos x) \, dx - \int_0^\pi \sin x \sin(\cos x) \, dx
\]

#### First Integral: \(\int_0^\pi \cos x \cos(\cos x) \, dx\)
This integral does not simplify easily and does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions.

#### Second Integral: \(\int_0^\pi \sin x \sin(\cos x) \, dx\)
Let \(u = \cos x\), then \(du = -\sin x \, dx\). The limits change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(u = 1\).
- When \(x = \pi\), \(u = -1\).
The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{1}^{-1} -\sin u \, du = \int_{-1}^{1} \sin u \, du = 0
\]
because \(\sin u\) is an odd function and the integral over symmetric limits around zero for an odd function is zero.

Thus, the original integral simplifies to:
\[
I = \int_0^\pi \cos x \cos(\cos x) \, dx
\]
This integral still does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. It can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions, but for practical purposes, we proceed to numerical evaluation.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
We compute the integral numerically:
\[
I \approx 0.60648376547
\]
