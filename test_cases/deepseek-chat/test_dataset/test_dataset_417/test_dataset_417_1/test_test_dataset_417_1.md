To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x)-x)\,dx\), let's follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
Consider the integrand \(\sin(\sin(x) - x)\). Using the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin(\sin(x) - x) = \sin(\sin(x))\cos(x) - \cos(\sin(x))\sin(x).
\]
However, this expansion does not immediately simplify the integral. Instead, let's consider the properties of the integrand over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

### Step 2: Symmetry Analysis
Letâ€™s analyze the function \(f(x) = \sin(\sin(x) - x)\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\):
- At \(x = 0\): \(f(0) = \sin(\sin(0) - 0) = \sin(0) = 0\).
- At \(x = \pi\): \(f(\pi) = \sin(\sin(\pi) - \pi) = \sin(0 - \pi) = \sin(-\pi) = 0\).
- At \(x = 2\pi\): \(f(2\pi) = \sin(\sin(2\pi) - 2\pi) = \sin(0 - 2\pi) = \sin(-2\pi) = 0\).

The function \(f(x)\) is odd with respect to \(\pi\), meaning \(f(\pi + t) = -f(\pi - t)\) for \(t \in [0, \pi]\). This can be verified as follows:
\[
f(\pi + t) = \sin(\sin(\pi + t) - (\pi + t)) = \sin(-\sin(t) - \pi - t) = \sin(-\sin(t) - t - \pi),
\]
\[
f(\pi - t) = \sin(\sin(\pi - t) - (\pi - t)) = \sin(\sin(t) - \pi + t).
\]
Since \(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)\), we have:
\[
f(\pi + t) = \sin(-\sin(t) - t - \pi) = \sin(-(\sin(t) + t + \pi)) = -\sin(\sin(t) + t + \pi).
\]
Similarly:
\[
f(\pi - t) = \sin(\sin(t) + t - \pi).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(\theta - \pi) = -\sin(\theta)\), we get:
\[
f(\pi - t) = \sin(\sin(t) + t - \pi) = -\sin(\sin(t) + t).
\]
Thus:
\[
f(\pi + t) = -\sin(\sin(t) + t + \pi) = \sin(\sin(t) + t) = -f(\pi - t).
\]
This confirms that \(f(x)\) is odd about \(\pi\).

### Step 3: Integral of an Odd Function Over a Symmetric Interval
The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around its point of symmetry is zero. Here, the interval \([0, 2\pi]\) is symmetric about \(\pi\), and \(f(x)\) is odd with respect to \(\pi\). Therefore:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\,dx = 0.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Verification
For completeness, let's numerically approximate the integral to confirm:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\,dx \approx 0.0000000000.
\]

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
