To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x) - x)\,dx\), let's follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
Consider the integrand \(sin(\sin(x) - x)\). Letâ€™s rewrite it using the angle subtraction formula for sine:
\[
\sin(\sin(x) - x) = \sin(\sin(x))\cos(x) - \cos(\sin(x))\sin(x)
\]
However, this doesn't immediately simplify the integral. Instead, let's consider the substitution \(u = x - \sin(x)\).

### Step 2: Substitution and Periodicity
Let \(u = x - \sin(x)\). The derivative is:
\[
\frac{du}{dx} = 1 - \cos(x)
\]
Notice that \(u(0) = 0 - \sin(0) = 0\) and \(u(2\pi) = 2\pi - \sin(2\pi) = 2\pi\). However, the function \(u(x)\) is not monotonic over \([0, 2\pi]\), so a direct substitution isn't straightforward.

### Step 3: Symmetry and Odd Function
Observe that \(\sin(\sin(x) - x)\) is an odd function with respect to \(x = \pi\). To see this, let \(x = \pi + t\):
\[
\sin(\sin(\pi + t) - (\pi + t)) = \sin(-\sin(t) - \pi - t) = \sin(-\sin(t) - t - \pi)
\]
Using the property \(\sin(-\theta - \pi) = \sin(\theta + \pi) = -\sin(\theta)\), we get:
\[
\sin(-\sin(t) - t - \pi) = -\sin(\sin(t) + t)
\]
Now, for \(x = \pi - t\):
\[
\sin(\sin(\pi - t) - (\pi - t)) = \sin(\sin(t) - \pi + t) = \sin(\sin(t) + t - \pi)
\]
Using \(\sin(\theta - \pi) = -\sin(\theta)\), we get:
\[
\sin(\sin(t) + t - \pi) = -\sin(\sin(t) + t)
\]
Thus, the integrand satisfies:
\[
\sin(\sin(\pi + t) - (\pi + t)) = -\sin(\sin(\pi - t) - (\pi - t))
\]
This shows that the integrand is antisymmetric about \(x = \pi\). Therefore, the integral over \([0, 2\pi]\) is zero.

### Step 4: Verification
Alternatively, consider the integral over one period. The function \(\sin(\sin(x) - x)\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\), and its integral over a full period is zero due to its antisymmetry about \(x = \pi\).

### Step 5: Numerical Verification
For completeness, here's a numerical approximation of the integral:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\,dx \approx 0.0000000000
\]

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(0\), and its numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
