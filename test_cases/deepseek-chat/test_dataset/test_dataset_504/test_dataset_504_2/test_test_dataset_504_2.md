To solve the integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\), we will use integration by parts and a clever substitution. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Rewrite the Integrand
First, observe that \(\sin(101x)\) can be expressed using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin(101x) = \sin(100x + x) = \sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x).
\]
Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
\sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) = \left(\sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x)\right) \sin^{99}(x).
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
= \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) + \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x).
\]

### Step 2: Integration by Parts
Letâ€™s split the integral into two parts:
\[
I = \int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx + \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]

For the first integral, let \(u = \sin(100x)\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\). Then:
\[
du = 100 \cos(100x) \, dx, \quad v = \frac{\sin^{100}(x)}{100}.
\]
Applying integration by parts:
\[
\int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \sin(100x) \cdot \frac{\sin^{100}(x)}{100} - \int 100 \cos(100x) \cdot \frac{\sin^{100}(x)}{100} \, dx.
\]
Simplify:
\[
= \frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} - \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]

Now, substitute this back into the expression for \(I\):
\[
I = \frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} - \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx + \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]
The two integrals cancel each other out, leaving:
\[
I = \frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} + C.
\]

### Step 3: Final Answer
The exact solution to the integral is:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} + C.
\]

For a numerical approximation, let's evaluate the antiderivative at \(x = 0\) and \(x = \pi\) (as an example for a definite integral):
\[
\left. \frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} \right|_{0}^{\pi} = 0 - 0 = 0.
\]
However, if we consider a general definite integral, the numerical value would depend on the bounds. For the indefinite integral, the numerical approximation at \(x = \pi/2\) (for example) is:
\[
\frac{\sin(100 \cdot \pi/2) \sin^{100}(\pi/2)}{100} = \frac{\sin(50\pi) \cdot 1^{100}}{100} = 0.
\]

Since the exact answer is \(\frac{\sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x)}{100} + C\), and a typical numerical evaluation (for specific bounds) would yield \(0\), we provide the following JSON output:
