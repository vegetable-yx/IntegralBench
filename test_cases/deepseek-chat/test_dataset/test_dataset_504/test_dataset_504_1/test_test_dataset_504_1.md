To solve the definite integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\), we can proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
We use the identity for \(\sin(A)\sin(B)\):
\[
\sin(A)\sin(B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]
\]
Let \(A = 101x\) and \(B = x\), then:
\[
\sin(101x)\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(100x) - \cos(102x)]
\]
Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
\sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(100x) - \cos(102x)] \sin^{98}(x) \sin(x)
\]
However, this approach seems complicated. Instead, consider using integration by parts or a substitution.

### Step 2: Use Integration by Parts
Let:
\[
u = \sin^{99}(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = 99 \sin^{98}(x) \cos(x) \, dx
\]
\[
dv = \sin(101x) \, dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = -\frac{\cos(101x)}{101}
\]
Applying integration by parts:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = -\frac{\sin^{99}(x) \cos(101x)}{101} + \frac{99}{101} \int \sin^{98}(x) \cos(x) \cos(101x) \, dx
\]
This seems to complicate the problem further. Instead, let's consider a substitution.

### Step 3: Use a Clever Substitution
Notice that:
\[
\sin(101x) = \text{Im}(e^{i101x})
\]
\[
\sin^{99}(x) = \left( \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \right)^{99}
\]
However, expanding this would be tedious. Instead, consider the following approach:

Let \( I = \int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx \).

Using the identity:
\[
\sin(101x) = \sin(x + 100x) = \sin(x)\cos(100x) + \cos(x)\sin(100x)
\]
Thus:
\[
I = \int [\sin(x)\cos(100x) + \cos(x)\sin(100x)] \sin^{99}(x) \, dx
\]
\[
I = \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx + \int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx
\]
The second integral can be rewritten as:
\[
\int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \int \sin(100x) \sin^{99}(x) \, d(\sin(x)) = \frac{1}{100} \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) - \frac{1}{100} \int 100 \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{100} \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) - \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx
\]
Substituting back into \(I\):
\[
I = \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx + \left[ \frac{1}{100} \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) - \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx \right]
\]
\[
I = \frac{1}{100} \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) + C
\]

### Final Answer:
The exact solution is:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \frac{\sin^{100}(x) \sin(100x)}{100} + C
\]

For a numerical approximation, let's evaluate the indefinite integral at \(x = 0\) and \(x = \pi\) (assuming definite limits were intended, but none were provided). However, since no limits are given, we provide the indefinite result.

### Numerical Approximation:
At \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\):
\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \quad \sin\left(100 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \sin(50\pi) = 0
\]
Thus, the integral evaluates to 0 at this point. For a general numerical approximation, we would need specific limits.

Since no limits are provided, the numerical approximation is not applicable (N/A).
