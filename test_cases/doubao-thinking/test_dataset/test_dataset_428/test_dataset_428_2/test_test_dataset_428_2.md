To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor\), we use properties of the Stieltjes integral with respect to a step function. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is a step function that jumps by 1 at each integer \(x = k\) (where \(k\) is an integer). 

### Key Observations:
1. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant on intervals \([k, k+1)\) for integers \(k\), so the Stieltjes integral over these intervals is zero (since the integrator does not change).
2. The integral receives contributions only at the jump points of \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) within the interval \([0, 3]\). These jump points are \(x = 1, 2, 3\) (since the jump at \(x = 0\) occurs before the interval starts).

### Calculation:
At each jump point \(x = k\) (for \(k = 1, 2, 3\)), the integrator \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) increases by 1. The integral is the sum of the function \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\) evaluated at these jump points, multiplied by the size of the jump (which is 1 for each integer):

\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = f(1) + f(2) + f(3)
\]

Substituting \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\):
- \(f(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2\)
- \(f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\)
- \(f(3) = 3^2 + 1 = 10\)

Summing these contributions:
\[
2 + 5 + 10 = 17
\]

### Numerical Approximation:
The exact result is an integer, so the numerical approximation is \(17.0000000000\).
