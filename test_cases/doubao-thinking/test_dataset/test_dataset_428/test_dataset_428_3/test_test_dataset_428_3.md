To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor\), we use properties of the Stieltjes integral with respect to a step function. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is a right-continuous step function with jumps of size 1 at each integer \(x = n\) (for \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)). 

### Key Observations:
1. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant on intervals \([n, n+1)\) for integers \(n\).
2. At each integer \(x = n\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) has a jump discontinuity where the value increases by 1 (i.e., the jump size is 1).
3. For the interval \([0, 3]\), the jump points of \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) are \(x = 1, 2, 3\) (since \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant on \([0,1)\), \([1,2)\), \([2,3)\), and jumps at \(x = 1, 2, 3\)).

### Evaluation of the Integral:
The Stieltjes integral of a function \(f(x)\) with respect to a step function \(\alpha(x)\) is the sum of \(f(x)\) evaluated at the jump points of \(\alpha(x)\) multiplied by the size of the jumps. Here, \(\alpha(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor\) has jumps of size 1 at \(x = 1, 2, 3\). Thus:
\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = \sum_{\text{jump points}} f(x) \cdot (\text{jump size})
\]
Substituting the jump points and their contributions:
- At \(x = 1\): \(f(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2\), jump size = 1, contribution = \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\).
- At \(x = 2\): \(f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\), jump size = 1, contribution = \(5 \cdot 1 = 5\).
- At \(x = 3\): \(f(3) = 3^2 + 1 = 10\), jump size = 1, contribution = \(10 \cdot 1 = 10\).

Summing these contributions gives:
\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17
\]

### Numerical Approximation:
The exact result is an integer, so the numerical approximation is \(17.0000000000\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
