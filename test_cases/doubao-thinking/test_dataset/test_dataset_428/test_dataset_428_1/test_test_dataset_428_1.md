To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor\), we use properties of the Stieltjes integral with respect to a step function. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is a step function that jumps by 1 at each integer \(x = k\) (for integer \(k\)). 

### Key Observations:
1. The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant on intervals \([k, k+1)\) for integers \(k\) and has jumps of 1 at each integer \(k\).
2. For a Stieltjes integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, d\alpha(x)\) where \(\alpha(x)\) is a step function with jumps at points \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) in \([a, b]\), the integral equals the sum of \(f(x_i)\) multiplied by the size of the jump at \(x_i\).

### Steps to Solution:
- Identify the jump points of \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) in \([0, 3]\): These occur at \(x = 1, 2, 3\) (since \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps by 1 at each integer).
- Evaluate \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\) at each jump point:
  - At \(x = 1\): \(f(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 2\)
  - At \(x = 2\): \(f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\)
  - At \(x = 3\): \(f(3) = 3^2 + 1 = 10\)
- Sum these values (each multiplied by the jump size of 1): \(2 + 5 + 10 = 17\).

### Numerical Approximation:
The exact result is an integer, so the numerical approximation is \(17.0000000000\).
