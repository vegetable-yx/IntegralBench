To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x)-x)\, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Exploit Symmetry via Substitution
Consider splitting the integral into two parts over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\). For the second part, use the substitution \(u = 2\pi - x\), which transforms the interval \([\pi, 2\pi]\) to \([0, \pi]\) and \(dx = -du\). 

For the integral over \([\pi, 2\pi]\):
\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx = \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(\sin(2\pi - u) - (2\pi - u))\, du
\]
Since \(\sin(2\pi - u) = -\sin(u)\), the argument simplifies to:
\[
\sin(-\sin(u) - 2\pi + u) = \sin(u - \sin(u) - 2\pi)
\]
Using the periodicity of sine (\(\sin(\theta - 2\pi) = \sin(\theta)\)), this becomes:
\[
\sin(u - \sin(u))
\]
But \(u - \sin(u) = -(\sin(u) - u)\), so \(\sin(u - \sin(u)) = \sin(-(\sin(u) - u)) = -\sin(\sin(u) - u)\).

### Step 2: Combine the Integrals
The original integral is the sum of the two parts:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx + \int_0^{\pi} -\sin(\sin(u) - u)\, du
\]
Since \(u\) is a dummy variable, the second integral is \(-\int_0^{\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx\). Thus:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx - \int_0^{\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx = 0
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is \(0\). Numerically, this is trivially \(0.0000000000\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
