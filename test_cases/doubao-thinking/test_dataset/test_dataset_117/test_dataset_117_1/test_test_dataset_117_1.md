To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves the product of two complete elliptic integrals of the first kind, \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\) and \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\), multiplied by \(x^2\). Key properties of elliptic integrals and known results for integrals involving their products are used here. 

A critical observation is recognizing that integrals of the form \(\int_{0}^{1} x^n \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx\) have known closed-form solutions for specific \(n\). For \(n=2\), the exact result is derived from symmetry and properties of elliptic integrals, leading to the conclusion that the integral simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^4}{128}\).

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^4}{128}\) is computed as follows:
\[
\pi^4 \approx 97.409091034, \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{\pi^4}{128} \approx \frac{97.409091034}{128} \approx 0.7609928987
\]

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^4}{128}\), and its numerical approximation is approximately \(0.7609928987\).
