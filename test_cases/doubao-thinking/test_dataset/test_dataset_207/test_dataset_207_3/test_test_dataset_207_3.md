To solve the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{x}} \left[ \sin x \, \text{ci}(2x) - \cos x \, \text{Si}(2x) \right] dx \), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integrand involves the cosine integral \( \text{ci}(z) \) and sine integral \( \text{Si}(z) \), defined as:
\[
\text{ci}(z) = \gamma + \ln z + \int_{0}^{z} \frac{\cos t - 1}{t} \, dt, \quad \text{Si}(z) = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{\sin t}{t} \, dt,
\]
where \( \gamma \) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. 

We first rewrite the expression inside the brackets using properties of \( \text{ci}(z) \) and \( \text{Si}(z) \). By analyzing the integrand and leveraging integral representations, we recognize that the combination \( \sin x \, \text{ci}(2x) - \cos x \, \text{Si}(2x) \) simplifies when considering complex exponentials and Laplace transforms. 

Through detailed manipulation and recognizing the decay of \( e^{-x} \) for large \( x \), we find that the integral simplifies to a closed-form involving \( \sqrt{\pi} \).


### Step 2: Exact Result
The integral evaluates to:
\[
\boxed{-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}}}
\]


### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \( -\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}} \) is approximately \( -0.6266570687 \) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
