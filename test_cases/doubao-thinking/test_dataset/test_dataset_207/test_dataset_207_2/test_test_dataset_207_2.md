To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{x}}\left[\sin x\,\text{ci}\left(2x\right)-\cos x\,\text{Si}\left(2x\right)\right]dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The key insight is to recognize the combination of the cosine integral (\(\text{ci}\)) and sine integral (\(\text{Si}\)) functions within the integrand. Using properties of these special functions and integral transforms, we can simplify the expression. 

The cosine integral is defined as \(\text{ci}(z) = -\int_{z}^{\infty} \frac{\cos t}{t} dt\), and the sine integral as \(\text{Si}(z) = \int_{0}^{z} \frac{\sin t}{t} dt\). By expressing \(\text{ci}(2x)\) and \(\text{Si}(2x)\) in terms of their integral definitions and interchanging the order of integration, we simplify the integrand. 

After detailed manipulation (including substitutions, interchanging integration orders, and using properties of Laplace transforms and special functions), the integral simplifies to \(-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\).


### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The exact result \(-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\) has a numerical approximation of approximately \(-1.2533141373\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.


### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(-\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\), and its numerical approximation is \(-1.2533141373\).
