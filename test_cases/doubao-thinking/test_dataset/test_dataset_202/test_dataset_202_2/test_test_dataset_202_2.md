To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
First, rewrite the argument inside the cosine function:
\[
x(2 - x) = 2x - x^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2
\]
Thus, \(\sqrt{x(2 - x)} = \sqrt{1 - (x - 1)^2}\). Let \(t = x - 1\), so \(x = t + 1\) and \(dx = dt\). The limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(t = -1\) and \(x = 2\) to \(t = 1\). Substituting these, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} (t + 1) \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 2: Split the Integral
Split the integral into two parts:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} t \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt + \int_{-1}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]
The first integral involves an odd function (\(t \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right)\)) integrated over a symmetric interval around 0, so it equals 0. Thus, the integral reduces to:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 3: Exploit Symmetry
Since the integrand \(\cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right)\) is even, we can rewrite the integral as:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 4: Substitution for Simplification
Let \(t = \sin\theta\), so \(dt = \cos\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - t^2} = \cos\theta\). The limits change from \(t = 0\) to \(\theta = 0\) and \(t = 1\) to \(\theta = \pi/2\). The integral becomes:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos\theta) \cos\theta \, d\theta
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
This integral does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. We approximate it numerically using a Taylor series expansion of \(\cos(\cos\theta)\) and integrating term-by-term. The series converges quickly, and summing the first few terms gives a precise approximation.

### Numerical Result
The numerical approximation of the integral, rounded to 10 decimal places, is approximately \(1.3765278970\).

### Final Answer
The exact answer is the integral itself, and the numerical approximation is as follows.
