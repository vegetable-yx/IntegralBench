To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), we start by analyzing the fractional part function \(\{x\}\), which is defined as \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\). This function is periodic with period 1, meaning its behavior repeats every interval of length 1. 

### Step 1: Break the integral into periodic intervals
The interval \([0, 4]\) can be divided into four subintervals of length 1: \([0, 1)\), \([1, 2)\), \([2, 3)\), and \([3, 4]\). In each subinterval \([n, n+1)\) (where \(n = 0, 1, 2, 3\)), the fractional part \(\{x\}\) simplifies to \(x - n\) because \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\) for \(x \in [n, n+1)\).

### Step 2: Compute the integral over one period
Consider the integral over \([n, n+1)\). Let \(t = x - n\), so \(t \in [0, 1)\) and \(dx = dt\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{n}^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} t^4 \, dt
\]
The antiderivative of \(t^4\) is \(\frac{t^5}{5}\). Evaluating from 0 to 1:
\[
\left. \frac{t^5}{5} \right|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1^5}{5} - \frac{0^5}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the integrals over all intervals
Since the integral over each subinterval \([n, n+1)\) is \(\frac{1}{5}\), and there are 4 such intervals in \([0, 4]\), the total integral is:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{4}{5}\) is \(0.8\) in decimal form. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is \(0.8000000000\).
