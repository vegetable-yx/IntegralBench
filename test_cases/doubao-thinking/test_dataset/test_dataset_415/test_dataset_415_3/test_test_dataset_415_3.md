To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), we start by analyzing the fractional part function \(\{x\}\), which is defined as \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\). This function is periodic with period 1, meaning its behavior repeats every interval \([n, n+1]\) for integer \(n\). 

### Step 1: Break the integral into intervals
Over each interval \([n, n+1]\) where \(n\) is an integer, the fractional part \(\{x\}\) simplifies to \(x - n\). For the integral from \(0\) to \(4\), we split the domain into four intervals: \([0,1]\), \([1,2]\), \([2,3]\), and \([3,4]\). Thus:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^3 \int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate each sub-integral
For each interval \([n, n+1]\), let \(u = x - n\). Then \(du = dx\), and when \(x = n\), \(u = 0\); when \(x = n+1\), \(u = 1\). The integral over \([n, n+1]\) becomes:
\[
\int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 u^4 \, du
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integral over \([0,1]\)
The antiderivative of \(u^4\) is \(\frac{u^5}{5}\). Evaluating from \(0\) to \(1\):
\[
\int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left. \frac{u^5}{5} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1^5}{5} - \frac{0^5}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

### Step 4: Sum the results
Since there are 4 intervals (from \(n=0\) to \(n=3\)), the total integral is:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^3 \frac{1}{5} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{4}{5}\) is \(0.8\) in decimal form. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is \(0.8000000000\).
