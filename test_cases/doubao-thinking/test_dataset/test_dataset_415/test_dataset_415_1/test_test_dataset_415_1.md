To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), we start by recalling that \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), defined as \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\). The fractional part function is periodic with period 1, meaning its behavior repeats every interval of length 1. 

### Step 1: Break the integral into intervals where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant
Over \([0, 4]\), the floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) takes integer values \(0, 1, 2, 3\) on the subintervals:
- \([0, 1)\): \(\lfloor x \rfloor = 0\), so \(\{x\} = x - 0 = x\)
- \([1, 2)\): \(\lfloor x \rfloor = 1\), so \(\{x\} = x - 1\)
- \([2, 3)\): \(\lfloor x \rfloor = 2\), so \(\{x\} = x - 2\)
- \([3, 4]\): \(\lfloor x \rfloor = 3\), so \(\{x\} = x - 3\)

Thus, the integral splits into four integrals over these subintervals:
\[
\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^4 \, dx + \int_1^2 (x-1)^4 \, dx + \int_2^3 (x-2)^4 \, dx + \int_3^4 (x-3)^4 \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate each integral
Each integral has the form \(\int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx\) for \(n = 0, 1, 2, 3\). Using the substitution \(u = x - n\) (so \(du = dx\) and the limits shift to \(u = 0\) to \(u = 1\)), each integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 u^4 \, du
\]

The antiderivative of \(u^4\) is \(\frac{u^5}{5}\). Evaluating from \(0\) to \(1\):
\[
\left. \frac{u^5}{5} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1^5}{5} - \frac{0^5}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the results
Since each of the four integrals equals \(\frac{1}{5}\), the total integral is:
\[
4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{4}{5}\) is \(0.8\) in decimal form. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is \(0.8000000000\).
