To solve the integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\), we use trigonometric identities and integration by parts.

### Step 1: Expand \(\sin(101x)\) using the sine addition formula
We start by expressing \(\sin(101x)\) as \(\sin(100x + x)\). Using the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin(101x) = \sin(100x + x) = \sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x).
\]

### Step 2: Split the integral
Substituting this into the original integral, we split it into two terms:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \int \left[ \sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x) \right] \sin^{99}(x) \, dx.
\]
This separates into:
\[
\int \sin(100x)\cos(x)\sin^{99}(x) \, dx + \int \cos(100x)\sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]

### Step 3: Integrate the first term by parts
For the first integral, let \(u = \sin^{100}(x)\). Then \(du = 100\sin^{99}(x)\cos(x) \, dx\), so \(\sin^{99}(x)\cos(x) \, dx = \frac{du}{100}\). The first integral becomes:
\[
\int \sin(100x) \cdot \frac{du}{100} = \frac{1}{100} \int \sin(100x) \, du.
\]
Using integration by parts (\(\int v \, du = uv - \int u \, dv\)) with \(v = \sin(100x)\) and \(du = \frac{du}{100}\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{100} \left[ u\sin(100x) - \int u \cdot 100\cos(100x) \, dx \right] = \frac{\sin^{100}(x)\sin(100x)}{100} - \int \sin^{100}(x)\cos(100x) \, dx.
\]

### Step 4: Combine terms and simplify
The second integral in Step 2 is \(\int \cos(100x)\sin^{100}(x) \, dx\). Adding this to the result of the first integral:
\[
\left( \frac{\sin^{100}(x)\sin(100x)}{100} - \int \sin^{100}(x)\cos(100x) \, dx \right) + \int \sin^{100}(x)\cos(100x) \, dx.
\]
The integrals cancel, leaving:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \frac{\sin^{100}(x)\sin(100x)}{100} + C.
\]

### Numerical Approximation
For a definite integral over intervals like \([0, \pi]\) or \([0, 2\pi]\), the result is \(0\) because \(\sin(100x)\) and \(\sin(x)\) vanish at the endpoints. Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
