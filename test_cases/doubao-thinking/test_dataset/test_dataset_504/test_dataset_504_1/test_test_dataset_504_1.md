To solve the definite integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\), we first consider the indefinite integral and then evaluate it over a common interval like \([0, \pi]\).

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand Using Trigonometric Identities
We use the identity for \(\sin(101x)\) by expressing it as \(\sin(100x + x)\) and applying the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin(101x) = \sin(100x + x) = \sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x).
\]
Substituting this into the integrand, we get:
\[
\sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) = \left[\sin(100x)\cos(x) + \cos(100x)\sin(x)\right] \sin^{99}(x).
\]
This splits the integral into two parts:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx + \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]

### Step 2: Integrate by Parts
For the first integral, let \(u = \sin^{100}(x)\). Then \(du = 100 \sin^{99}(x) \cos(x) \, dx\), so \(\sin^{99}(x) \cos(x) \, dx = \frac{du}{100}\). Rewriting the first integral:
\[
\int \sin(100x) \cos(x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{100} \int \sin(100x) \, du.
\]
Integrating by parts (\(\int v \, du = uv - \int u \, dv\)) with \(v = \sin(100x)\) and \(du = du\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{100} \left[ \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) - 100 \int \sin^{100}(x) \cos(100x) \, dx \right].
\]

### Step 3: Combine Integrals
Substituting back, the original integral becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{100} \sin(100x) \sin^{100}(x) - \int \sin^{100}(x) \cos(100x) \, dx + \int \cos(100x) \sin^{100}(x) \, dx.
\]
The two integrals cancel, leaving:
\[
\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{100} \sin^{100}(x) \sin(100x) + C.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Definite Integral Over \([0, \pi]\)
For the definite integral over \([0, \pi]\), we substitute the limits:
\[
\left. \frac{1}{100} \sin^{100}(x) \sin(100x) \right|_0^\pi.
\]
At \(x = \pi\), \(\sin(\pi) = 0\) and \(\sin(100\pi) = 0\), so the term is \(0\). At \(x = 0\), \(\sin(0) = 0\) and \(\sin(0) = 0\), so the term is also \(0\). Thus, the definite integral over \([0, \pi]\) is \(0\).

### Numerical Approximation
The result is exactly \(0\), so the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
