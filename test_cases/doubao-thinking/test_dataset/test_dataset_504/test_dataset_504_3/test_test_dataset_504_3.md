To solve the definite integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x) \, dx\), we first consider the context of a standard interval for trigonometric integrals, such as \([0, \pi]\). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Trigonometric Expansion of \(\sin^m(x)\)**: For odd \(m\), \(\sin^m(x)\) can be expressed as a linear combination of \(\sin(kx)\) where \(k\) is an odd integer ranging from \(1\) to \(m\). For \(m = 99\), \(\sin^{99}(x)\) expands to a sum of \(\sin(kx)\) with \(k = 1, 3, 5, \ldots, 99\).

2. **Orthogonality of Sine Functions**: The integral of \(\sin(nx) \sin(kx)\) over \([0, \pi]\) is zero if \(n \neq k\), and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) if \(n = k\). This is a result of the orthogonality of sine functions on this interval.

### Analysis:
The integrand \(\sin(101x) \sin^{99}(x)\) involves \(\sin(101x)\) multiplied by \(\sin^{99}(x)\). Since \(\sin^{99}(x)\) expands to a sum of \(\sin(kx)\) with \(k \leq 99\) (all odd), the product \(\sin(101x) \cdot \sin(kx)\) for \(k \leq 99\) will have \(n = 101 \neq k\). By orthogonality, each term in the expanded product integrates to zero over \([0, \pi]\).

### Conclusion:
Thus, the integral over \([0, \pi]\) (or any full period interval) is zero.

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of the integral is \(0\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
