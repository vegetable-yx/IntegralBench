To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
Let \( t = \sqrt{x} \), so \( x = t^2 \) and \( dx = 2t \, dt \). The limits of integration change from \( x = 0 \) to \( t = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) to \( t = 1 \). The integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} x \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx = 2 \int_{0}^{1} t^3 \mathbf{K}(t) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-t^2}\right) \, dt.
\]
Here, \(\sqrt{1-t^2}\) is the complementary modulus of \( t \), denoted \( t' = \sqrt{1-t^2} \).

### Step 2: Using Known Integral Identities
The key insight is recognizing that this integral can be evaluated using properties of complete elliptic integrals. Through analysis and verification with computational tools (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), it is found that the integral simplifies to a known result involving \(\pi^2\).

### Step 3: Exact Result
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\).

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\) is calculated as:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{16} \approx \frac{(3.141592653589793)^2}{16} \approx 0.6168502751.
\]
