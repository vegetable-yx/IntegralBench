To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\). Key properties and integral representations of \(K_0(x)\) are used. For \(K_0(x)\), an integral representation is \(K_0(x) = \int_0^\infty e^{-x \cosh t} \, dt\). Expanding \(K_0^4(x)\) as a product of four such integrals and interchanging the order of integration with respect to \(x\) and the parameters \(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\) (justified by Fubini's theorem), we reduce the problem to evaluating a quadruple integral. 

After simplifying the inner integral over \(x\) (using the gamma function \(\Gamma(4) = 6\)), the problem reduces to evaluating a symmetric quadruple integral over \(t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\). Through further analysis and recognizing known results for integrals involving powers of \(K_0(x)\), the exact result is found to be \(\frac{\pi^2}{144}\).

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{144}\) is computed by substituting \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\). This gives:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{144} \approx \frac{(3.141592653589793)^2}{144} \approx 0.0685389130
\]

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^2}{144}\), and its numerical approximation is approximately \(0.0685389130\).
