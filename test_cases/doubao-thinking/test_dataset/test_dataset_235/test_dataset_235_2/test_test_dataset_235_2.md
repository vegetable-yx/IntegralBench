To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^{-1/2} \left[1 - \sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-2} \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \( y = \sqrt{x(1-x)} \). This transforms the integral by leveraging symmetry and algebraic manipulation. After several substitutions and simplifications (detailed in the thought process), we reduce the integral to a more manageable form involving \( t \):

\[
I = 8 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{(1 + t^2)^2} \, dt
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Integral
The integral \(\int \frac{1}{(1 + t^2)^2} \, dt\) is a standard result. Using integration by parts or known formulas, we find:

\[
\int \frac{1}{(1 + t^2)^2} \, dt = \frac{t}{2(1 + t^2)} + \frac{1}{2} \arctan(t) + C
\]

Evaluating this from \(0\) to \(1\):

\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{(1 + t^2)^2} \, dt = \left[ \frac{t}{2(1 + t^2)} + \frac{1}{2} \arctan(t) \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\pi}{8}
\]

### Step 3: Final Result
Substituting back, we get:

\[
I = 8 \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\pi}{8} \right) = 2 + \pi
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(2 + \pi\) is approximately \(5.1415926536\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
