To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analyze the integrand's symmetry
Consider the substitution \(x \to \pi - x\). Let \(f(x) = \cos(x + \cos x)\). Then:
\[
f(\pi - x) = \cos\left((\pi - x) + \cos(\pi - x)\right)
\]
Since \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos x\), this simplifies to:
\[
f(\pi - x) = \cos\left(\pi - x - \cos x\right) = \cos\left(\pi - (x + \cos x)\right)
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(\pi - \theta) = -\cos \theta\), we get:
\[
f(\pi - x) = -\cos(x + \cos x) = -f(x)
\]
Thus, \(f(\pi - x) = -f(x)\), meaning the integrand is **antisymmetric** about \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

### Step 2: Evaluate the integral using symmetry
For an integral over a symmetric interval \([a, b]\) where \(b - a\) is the length of the interval, if \(f(c + t) = -f(c - t)\) (antisymmetry about \(c\)), the integral over \([a, b]\) is zero. Here, the interval \([0, \pi]\) is symmetric about \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\), and \(f\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + t\right) = -f\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - t\right)\). Therefore:
\[
\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx = 0
\]

### Step 3: Numerical approximation
Since the exact value is \(0\), the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is also \(0.0000000000\).
