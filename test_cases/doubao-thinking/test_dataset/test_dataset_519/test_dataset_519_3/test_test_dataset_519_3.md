To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\cos(x)}{2-\cos^2(x)}dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator
First, rewrite the denominator \(2 - \cos^2(x)\) using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2(x) = 1 - \cos^2(x)\):
\[
2 - \cos^2(x) = 1 + (1 - \cos^2(x)) = 1 + \sin^2(x)
\]
Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos(x)}{1 + \sin^2(x)} \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Substitution
Let \(u = \sin(x)\). Then \(du = \cos(x) \, dx\), which matches the numerator. The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(u = \sin(0) = 0\).
- When \(x = \pi/2\), \(u = \sin(\pi/2) = 1\).

Substituting these into the integral, we get:
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{du}{1 + u^2}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the Integral
The integral \(\int \frac{du}{1 + u^2}\) is a standard result, equal to \(\arctan(u) + C\). Evaluating from \(0\) to \(1\):
\[
\left. \arctan(u) \right|_0^1 = \arctan(1) - \arctan(0)
\]
Since \(\arctan(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\arctan(0) = 0\), the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} - 0 = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is approximately \(0.7853981634\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
