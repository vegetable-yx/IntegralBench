To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\cos(x)}{2-\cos^2(x)}dx\), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the denominator using a trigonometric identity
The denominator \(2 - \cos^2(x)\) can be rewritten using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2(x) = 1 - \sin^2(x)\):
\[
2 - \cos^2(x) = 2 - (1 - \sin^2(x)) = 1 + \sin^2(x)
\]
Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos(x)}{1 + \sin^2(x)} \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Substitution
Let \(u = \sin(x)\). Then \(du = \cos(x) \, dx\), which matches the numerator \(\cos(x) \, dx\). The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(u = \sin(0) = 0\)
- When \(x = \pi/2\), \(u = \sin(\pi/2) = 1\)

Substituting these into the integral, we get:
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \, du
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the integral
The antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{1 + u^2}\) is \(\arctan(u)\). Evaluating from \(0\) to \(1\):
\[
\left[ \arctan(u) \right]_0^1 = \arctan(1) - \arctan(0)
\]
Since \(\arctan(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\arctan(0) = 0\), the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} - 0 = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Numerical approximation
The exact value \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is approximately \(0.7853981634\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
