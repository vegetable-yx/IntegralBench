To solve the definite integral \(\int_1^e \frac{\cos(\ln x)}{x} \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution
Let \( u = \ln x \). Then, the differential \( du \) is:
\[
du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx
\]
This substitution simplifies the integrand, as \(\frac{1}{x} \, dx = du\). 

### Step 2: Adjust Limits of Integration
When \( x = 1 \), \( u = \ln 1 = 0 \). When \( x = e \), \( u = \ln e = 1 \). Thus, the limits of integration change from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = e \) to \( u = 0 \) to \( u = 1 \).

### Step 3: Rewrite the Integral
Substituting \( u \) and \( du \) into the integral, we get:
\[
\int_1^e \frac{\cos(\ln x)}{x} \, dx = \int_0^1 \cos(u) \, du
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Integral
The antiderivative of \( \cos(u) \) is \( \sin(u) \). Evaluating from \( u = 0 \) to \( u = 1 \):
\[
\int_0^1 \cos(u) \, du = \left[ \sin(u) \right]_0^1 = \sin(1) - \sin(0)
\]
Since \( \sin(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( \sin(1) \).

### Numerical Approximation
The value of \( \sin(1) \) (in radians) is approximately \( 0.8414709848 \) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
