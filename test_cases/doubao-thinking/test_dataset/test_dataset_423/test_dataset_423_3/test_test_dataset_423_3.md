To solve the definite integral \(\int_1^{10} e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x \, dx\), we start by simplifying the integrand using properties of logarithms and exponentials.

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand
- The first term \(e^{\ln x}\) simplifies because \(e\) and \(\ln\) are inverse functions: \(e^{\ln x} = x\).
- The second term \(\ln e^x\) simplifies using the logarithm power rule: \(\ln e^x = x \cdot \ln e = x \cdot 1 = x\) (since \(\ln e = 1\)).

Thus, the integrand becomes \(x + x = 2x\).

### Step 2: Compute the integral
The integral reduces to \(\int_1^{10} 2x \, dx\). The antiderivative of \(2x\) is \(x^2\) (since \(\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x\)). By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
\[
\int_1^{10} 2x \, dx = \left[ x^2 \right]_1^{10} = 10^2 - 1^2 = 100 - 1 = 99
\]

### Step 3: Numerical approximation
The exact result is 99, so the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is 99.0000000000.
