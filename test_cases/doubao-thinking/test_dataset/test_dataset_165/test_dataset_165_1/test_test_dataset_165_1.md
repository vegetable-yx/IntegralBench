To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2x)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Introduce a Parameter and Differentiate
Let \(I(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\), where \(a > 0\). Our goal is to find \(I(2)\). Differentiating \(I(a)\) with respect to \(a\) (using Leibnizâ€™s rule for differentiation under the integral sign), we get:
\[
I'(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Derivative Using Bessel Functions
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\) is a known result involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0\). Specifically:
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx = K_0(a)
\]
where \(K_0\) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order 0.

### Step 3: Integrate to Find \(I(a)\)
Since \(I(0) = 0\) (the integrand vanishes when \(a=0\)), we integrate \(I'(a)\) from \(0\) to \(a\) to recover \(I(a)\):
\[
I(a) = \int_{0}^{a} K_0(t) dt
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate at \(a=2\)
For our problem, \(a=2\), so:
\[
I(2) = \int_{0}^{2} K_0(t) dt
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The integral \(\int_{0}^{2} K_0(t) dt\) is evaluated numerically. Using computational tools (e.g., Wolfram Alpha), the result is approximately \(0.6040277405\).


### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\int_{0}^{2} K_0(t) dt\), and the numerical approximation is \(0.6040277405\).
