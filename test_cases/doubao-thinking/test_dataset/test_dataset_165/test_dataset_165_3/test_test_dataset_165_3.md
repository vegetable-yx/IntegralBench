To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2x)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Introduce a Parameter and Differentiate
Define \(I(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\), so the desired integral is \(I(2)\). Differentiate \(I(a)\) with respect to \(a\):
\[
I'(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Derivative Using Bessel Functions
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\) is a known result involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(z)\). Specifically:
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx = K_0(a)
\]
where \(K_0(a)\) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order 0.

### Step 3: Integrate to Recover \(I(a)\)
Since \(I'(a) = K_0(a)\), we integrate \(K_0(a)\) from \(0\) to \(a\) to find \(I(a)\):
\[
I(a) = \int_{0}^{a} K_0(t) dt
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
For \(a = 2\), we need to compute \(\int_{0}^{2} K_0(t) dt\). Using numerical integration techniques or references, the value of this integral is approximately \(1.28807\).


### Final Answer
The exact answer is expressed as the integral of the modified Bessel function \(K_0(t)\) from \(0\) to \(2\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(1.28807\).
