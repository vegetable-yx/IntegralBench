To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2x)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Solution
We define the integral as \(I(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(ax)}{x\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx\) with \(a = 2\). Differentiating \(I(a)\) with respect to \(a\) (by Leibnizâ€™s rule) gives:
\[
I'(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx
\]
This integral is a known result involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0\), specifically:
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(ax)}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx = K_0(a)
\]
where \(K_0(a)\) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order 0. Integrating \(I'(a)\) from \(0\) to \(a\) (with \(I(0) = 0\)) gives:
\[
I(a) = \int_{0}^{a} K_0(t)dt
\]
For \(a = 2\), the exact form of the integral is:
\[
I(2) = \int_{0}^{2} K_0(t)dt
\]
Using properties of Bessel functions, this can also be expressed as:
\[
I(2) = \frac{\pi}{2}\left(1 - I_0(2)K_0(2)\right)
\]
where \(I_0(2)\) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 0 at \(2\).

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
Using numerical methods to evaluate \(\int_{0}^{2} K_0(t)dt\) or directly computing \(\frac{\pi}{2}\left(1 - I_0(2)K_0(2)\right)\) with known values of \(I_0(2) \approx 2.279585\) and \(K_0(2) \approx 0.113894\), we find:
\[
I(2) \approx 1.163170818
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\left(1 - I_0(2)K_0(2)\right)\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(1.163170818\).
