To solve the definite integral \( \int_0^1 x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I_1\left( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} \right) dx \), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Series Expansion of the Bessel Function
The modified Bessel function of the first kind \( I_1(z) \) has the series expansion:
\[
I_1(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{z^{2n+1}}{2^{2n+1} n! (n+1)!}
\]
Substituting \( z = (x(1 - x))^{1/4} \), the integrand becomes:
\[
x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(x(1 - x))^{(2n+1)/4}}{2^{2n+1} n! (n+1)!}
\]


### Step 2: Simplify the Integrand
The term \( (x(1 - x))^{(2n+1)/4} \) simplifies to \( x^{(2n+1)/4} (1 - x)^{(2n+1)/4} \). Multiplying by \( x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} \), the integrand becomes:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{2n+1} n! (n+1)!} x^{n/2} (1 - x)^{(n+1)/2}
\]


### Step 3: Integrate Term-by-Term
The integral reduces to summing over \( n \) the integral of \( x^{n/2} (1 - x)^{(n+1)/2} \) from 0 to 1. This is a Beta function:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{n/2} (1 - x)^{(n+1)/2} dx = B\left( \frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n+3}{2} \right) = \frac{\Gamma\left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right) \Gamma\left( \frac{n+3}{2} \right)}{\Gamma\left( \frac{2n+5}{2} \right)}
\]


### Step 4: Series Summation
Substituting the Beta function into the series, the integral becomes:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{2n+1} n! (n+1)!} \cdot \frac{\Gamma\left( \frac{n}{2} + 1 \right) \Gamma\left( \frac{n+3}{2} \right)}{\Gamma\left( \frac{2n+5}{2} \right)}
\]


### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
Evaluating the first few terms of the series (up to \( n=4 \)) gives a numerical approximation. The series converges quickly, and the sum of the first five terms is approximately \( 0.3503003904 \).


### Final Answer
The exact answer is the infinite series derived above, and the numerical approximation is approximately \( 0.3503003904 \).
