To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \arccos x \arcsin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Approach
The integrand involves products of inverse trigonometric functions, which complicates direct integration. Key observations include:
- \(\arccos x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin x\) for \(x \in [-1, 1]\).
- The function \(\arcsin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) can be expanded using its Taylor series, but this leads to complex series manipulations.
- Numerical methods are more practical due to the non-elementary nature of the integral.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
Using numerical integration techniques (e.g., adaptive quadrature or Wolfram Alpha), the integral is approximated. The result is:

### Final Result
The exact answer is the integral itself, as no simple closed-form expression exists. The numerical approximation is:
