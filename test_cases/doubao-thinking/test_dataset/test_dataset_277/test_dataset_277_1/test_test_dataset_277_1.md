To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 \sqrt{x(2-x)} \cosh\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \(t = x - 1\), which transforms the integral into a symmetric form around \(t = 0\). This gives \(x = t + 1\), \(dx = dt\), and \(x(2 - x) = 1 - t^2\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1 - t^2} \cosh\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]
Since the integrand is even, we simplify to:
\[
2 \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - t^2} \cosh\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 2: Connection to Modified Bessel Functions
Next, we use properties of modified Bessel functions. The integral can be related to the modified Bessel functions \(I_0(z)\) and \(I_1(z)\) through their integral representations. Specifically, using recurrence relations for Bessel functions, we find that the integral simplifies to:
\[
\pi \left( I_0(1) - I_1(1) \right)
\]
where \(I_0(1)\) and \(I_1(1)\) are the modified Bessel functions of the first kind of order 0 and 1, evaluated at \(z = 1\).

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
Using known values for the modified Bessel functions:
- \(I_0(1) \approx 1.2660658777520081\)
- \(I_1(1) \approx 0.565159103992485\)

Thus, the integral evaluates to:
\[
\pi \left( 1.2660658777520081 - 0.565159103992485 \right) \approx \pi \times 0.7009067737595231 \approx 2.192231403
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\pi \left( I_0(1) - I_1(1) \right)\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(2.192231403\).
