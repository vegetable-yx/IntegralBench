To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}\cosh\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
First, observe that \(x(2-x) = 1 - (x-1)^2\), which suggests a substitution to simplify the argument of the hyperbolic cosine. Let \(u = \sqrt{x(2-x)}\), so \(u^2 = x(2-x)\). This transforms the integral into a form involving \(u\), but further simplification is needed.

### Step 2: Trigonometric Substitution
Using the substitution \(x = 1 + \cos\theta\) (or equivalently, \(x = 2\sin^2\theta\)), we rewrite the integral in terms of \(\theta\). However, a more effective approach leverages properties of modified Bessel functions. 

### Step 3: Integral Transformation and Bessel Functions
The integral can be rewritten using the identity \(\sin^2\phi = \frac{1 - \cos(2\phi)}{2}\) and recognizing that integrals of the form \(\int_0^\pi \cosh(\sin\phi)d\phi\) and \(\int_0^\pi \cos(n\phi)\cosh(\sin\phi)d\phi\) relate to modified Bessel functions \(I_n(z)\). Specifically:
- \(\int_0^\pi \cosh(\sin\phi)d\phi = \pi I_0(1)\)
- \(\int_0^\pi \cos(2\phi)\cosh(\sin\phi)d\phi = \pi I_2(1)\)

### Step 4: Simplification Using Bessel Function Recurrence
Using the recurrence relation for modified Bessel functions \(I_{n-1}(z) - I_{n+1}(z) = \frac{2n}{z}I_n(z)\), we find \(I_0(1) - I_2(1) = 2I_1(1)\). Substituting this into the integral expression simplifies it to \(\pi I_1(1)\).

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The modified Bessel function \(I_1(1)\) is approximately \(0.565159103992485\). Multiplying by \(\pi\) gives the numerical result.

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\pi I_1(1)\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(1.7751603544\).
