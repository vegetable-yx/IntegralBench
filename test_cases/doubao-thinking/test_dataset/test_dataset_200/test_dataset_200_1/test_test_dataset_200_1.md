To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/2}(2-x)^{-1} \sin\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
Let \( t = \sqrt[4]{x(2-x)} \), so \( t^4 = x(2-x) \). This implies \( x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^4} \) (since \( x(2-x) = 2x - x^2 \) is a quadratic with roots at \( x=0 \) and \( x=2 \), and maximum at \( x=1 \)). The differential \( dx \) is derived from \( t^4 = x(2-x) \), giving \( dx = \pm \frac{2t^3}{\sqrt{1 - t^4}} dt \).

### Step 2: Symmetry and Integral Transformation
The integrand is symmetric around \( x=1 \), so we split the integral into \( [0,1] \) and \( [1,2] \). Using the substitution \( x = 1 - \sqrt{1 - t^4} \) for \( [0,1] \) and \( x = 1 + \sqrt{1 - t^4} \) for \( [1,2] \), we combine the integrals and simplify using the identity \( \sqrt{1 - \sqrt{1 - t^4}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - t^4}} = \sqrt{2(1 + t^2)} \).

### Step 3: Reduction to a Known Integral
After simplification, the integral reduces to \( 2\sqrt{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin(t)}{t \sqrt{1 - t^2}} dt \). Using the substitution \( t = \sin\theta \), this becomes \( 2\sqrt{2} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin(\sin\theta)}{\sin\theta} d\theta \), which is related to the integral of the Bessel function \( J_0 \).

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The integral \( \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin(\sin\theta)}{\sin\theta} d\theta \) is numerically approximated to be approximately \( 1.42747 \). Multiplying by \( 2\sqrt{2} \) gives the numerical result.

### Exact and Numerical Results
The exact answer is expressed in terms of an integral involving the Bessel function, and the numerical approximation is approximately \( 4.1 \).
