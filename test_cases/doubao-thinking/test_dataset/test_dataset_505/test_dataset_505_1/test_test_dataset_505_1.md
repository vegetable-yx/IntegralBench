To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand
Let \(\theta = \cos^{-1}(x)\). By definition, \(\cos(\theta) = x\) and \(\theta \in [0, \pi]\). Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\), we find:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
Thus, \(\sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\).

### Step 2: Evaluate the integral
The integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx
\]
This integral represents the area of a quarter-unit circle (since \(y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) is the upper half of the unit circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)). The area of a full unit circle is \(\pi\), so a quarter of it is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Step 3: Numerical approximation
The exact value is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\). Numerically, \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\), so:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7853981634
\]
