To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx\), we start by analyzing the fractional part function \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), which is periodic with period 1 and linear on each interval between consecutive integers. We split the integral into intervals where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant and compute each part separately.

### Step 1: Split the integral into intervals
The interval \([-4, 4]\) is divided into subintervals where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant:  
\([-4, -3), [-3, -2), [-2, -1), [-1, 0), [0, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4)\).

### Step 2: Evaluate integrals over negative intervals (\(x < 0\))
For \(x \in [-n-1, -n)\) where \(n = 0, 1, 2, 3\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor = -n-1\), so \(\{x\} = x + n + 1\). The integrand becomes \(e^{-x}(x + n + 1)\). Using substitution \(u = -x\) and integration by parts, we find:
- \(\int_{-4}^{-3} e^{-x}(x + 4) \, dx = e^4 - 2e^3\)
- \(\int_{-3}^{-2} e^{-x}(x + 3) \, dx = e^3 - 2e^2\)
- \(\int_{-2}^{-1} e^{-x}(x + 2) \, dx = e^2 - 2e\)
- \(\int_{-1}^{0} e^{-x}(x + 1) \, dx = e - 2\)

Summing these gives:  
\(e^4 - e^3 - e^2 - e - 2\).

### Step 3: Evaluate integrals over positive intervals (\(x \geq 0\))
For \(x \in [n, n+1)\) where \(n = 0, 1, 2, 3\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), so \(\{x\} = x - n\). The integrand becomes \(e^x(x - n)\). Using substitution \(u = x - n\) and integration by parts, we find:
- \(\int_{0}^{1} e^x \cdot x \, dx = 1\)
- \(\int_{1}^{2} e^x(x - 1) \, dx = e\)
- \(\int_{2}^{3} e^x(x - 2) \, dx = e^2\)
- \(\int_{3}^{4} e^x(x - 3) \, dx = e^3\)

Summing these gives:  
\(1 + e + e^2 + e^3\).

### Step 4: Combine results
Adding the results from negative and positive intervals:  
\[
(e^4 - e^3 - e^2 - e - 2) + (1 + e + e^2 + e^3) = e^4 - 1
\]

### Numerical Approximation
\(e^4 \approx 54.598150033144236\), so \(e^4 - 1 \approx 53.5981500331\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
