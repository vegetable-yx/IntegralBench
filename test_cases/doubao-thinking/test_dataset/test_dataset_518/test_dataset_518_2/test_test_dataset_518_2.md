To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi}\left|\sin(2018x)\right|dx\), we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the period of \(|\sin(2018x)|\)
The function \(\sin(kx)\) has a period of \(\frac{2\pi}{k}\). Taking the absolute value of \(\sin(kx)\) halves its period because the negative portions of \(\sin(kx)\) are reflected to positive values. Thus, the period of \(|\sin(kx)|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{k}\). For \(k = 2018\), the period of \(|\sin(2018x)|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\).

### Step 2: Count the number of periods in the interval \([0, 2018\pi]\)
The length of the interval is \(2018\pi - 0 = 2018\pi\). The number of periods \(N\) in this interval is:
\[
N = \frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Period length}} = \frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2018}} = 2018 \times 2018 = 2018^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integral over one period
Consider the integral of \(|\sin(2018x)|\) over one period \(\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2018}\right]\). Using the substitution \(u = 2018x\) (so \(du = 2018dx\) or \(dx = \frac{du}{2018}\)), the limits change from \(x = 0\) to \(u = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\pi}{2018}\) to \(u = \pi\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} |\sin(2018x)| \, dx = \int_0^\pi |\sin(u)| \cdot \frac{du}{2018}
\]
Since \(\sin(u) \geq 0\) for \(u \in [0, \pi]\), \(|\sin(u)| = \sin(u)\). The integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2018} \int_0^\pi \sin(u) \, du = \frac{1}{2018} \left[ -\cos(u) \right]_0^\pi = \frac{1}{2018} \left( -\cos(\pi) + \cos(0) \right) = \frac{1}{2018} \left( 1 + 1 \right) = \frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}
\]

### Step 4: Total integral over the interval \([0, 2018\pi]\)
The total integral is the number of periods \(N = 2018^2\) multiplied by the integral over one period \(\frac{1}{1009}\):
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} |\sin(2018x)| \, dx = 2018^2 \times \frac{1}{1009}
\]
Since \(2018 = 2 \times 1009\), we have \(2018^2 = (2 \times 1009)^2 = 4 \times 1009^2\). Thus:
\[
2018^2 \times \frac{1}{1009} = 4 \times 1009^2 \times \frac{1}{1009} = 4 \times 1009 = 4036
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact result is an integer, so the numerical approximation is \(4036.0000000000\).
