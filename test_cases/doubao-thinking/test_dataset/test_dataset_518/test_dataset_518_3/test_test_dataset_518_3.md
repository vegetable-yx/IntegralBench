To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi}\left|\sin(2018x)\right|dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analyze the periodicity of \(|\sin(2018x)|\)
The function \(|\sin(kx)|\) has a period of \(\frac{\pi}{k}\) because the absolute value of sine "folds" the negative half of the sine wave into the positive half, reducing the period by half. For \(k = 2018\), the period of \(|\sin(2018x)|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\).

### Step 2: Determine the number of periods in the interval \([0, 2018\pi]\)
The length of the interval is \(2018\pi\). The number of periods \(N\) in this interval is:
\[
N = \frac{\text{Length of interval}}{\text{Period length}} = \frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2018}} = 2018^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the integral over one period
Over one period \(\left[0, \frac{\pi}{2018}\right]\), \(|\sin(2018x)| = \sin(2018x)\) (since \(\sin(2018x) \geq 0\) in this interval). The integral over one period is:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} \sin(2018x) \, dx
\]
Using the substitution \(u = 2018x\) (so \(du = 2018 \, dx\) or \(dx = \frac{du}{2018}\)), the limits change from \(x = 0\) to \(u = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\pi}{2018}\) to \(u = \pi\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sin(u) \cdot \frac{du}{2018} = \frac{1}{2018} \int_0^{\pi} \sin(u) \, du
\]
The integral of \(\sin(u)\) over \([0, \pi]\) is \(2\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2018} \cdot 2 = \frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}
\]

### Step 4: Total integral over \(2018\pi\)
The total integral is the number of periods \(N = 2018^2\) multiplied by the integral over one period \(\frac{2}{2018}\):
\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| dx = 2018^2 \cdot \frac{2}{2018} = 2018 \cdot 2 = 4036
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact result is an integer, so the numerical approximation is \(4036.0000000000\).
