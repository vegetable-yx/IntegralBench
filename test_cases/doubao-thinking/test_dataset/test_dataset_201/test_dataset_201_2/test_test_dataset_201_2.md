To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we start by simplifying the argument of the cosine function. 

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand
The expression inside the square root, \(x(2 - x)\), can be rewritten by completing the square:
\[
x(2 - x) = 2x - x^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2
\]
This transforms the integral into:
\[
\int_{0}^{2} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - (x - 1)^2}\right) \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Substitution
Let \(t = x - 1\), so \(x = t + 1\) and \(dx = dt\). When \(x = 0\), \(t = -1\); when \(x = 2\), \(t = 1\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]
Since the integrand is even (symmetric about \(t = 0\)), we can simplify:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 3: Trigonometric Substitution
Let \(t = \sin\theta\), so \(dt = \cos\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - t^2} = \cos\theta\). When \(t = 0\), \(\theta = 0\); when \(t = 1\), \(\theta = \pi/2\). The integral becomes:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos\theta) \cdot \cos\theta \, d\theta
\]

### Step 4: Analytical Form
This integral does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed as a series by expanding \(\cos(\cos\theta)\) in its Taylor series:
\[
\cos(\cos\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n \cos^{2n}\theta}{(2n)!}
\]
Substituting this into the integral and integrating term-by-term (justified by uniform convergence) gives:
\[
2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^{2n+1}\theta \, d\theta
\]
The integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos^{2n+1}\theta \, d\theta\) is a known beta function integral, but the series remains the exact form.

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
Using numerical integration (e.g., Gaussian quadrature or high-precision methods), the integral approximates to:
\[
\approx 1.376526696
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is the integral itself, and the numerical approximation is approximately \(1.376526696\).
