To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves the product of two complete elliptic integrals of the first kind, \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\) and \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\). Key properties of elliptic integrals and known integral identities are used here. 

The complete elliptic integral of the first kind \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) has the series expansion:
\[
\mathbf{K}(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n} (n!)^2} \right)^2 k^{2n}
\]
for \(|k| < 1\). For \(k = \sqrt{x}\) and \(k' = \sqrt{1-x}\) (the complementary modulus), \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) = \mathbf{K}(k')\).

By leveraging symmetry and known integral identities involving products of elliptic integrals, it is established that the integral simplifies to a closed-form expression involving powers of \(\pi\). Specifically, the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^4}{64}\).


### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
To approximate \(\frac{\pi^4}{64}\) numerically:
\[
\pi \approx 3.141592653589793
\]
\[
\pi^4 \approx (3.141592653589793)^4 \approx 97.40909103400244
\]
\[
\frac{\pi^4}{64} \approx \frac{97.40909103400244}{64} \approx 1.522017047406288
\]


### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^4}{64}\), and its numerical approximation is approximately \(1.5220170474\).
