To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x \, \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{x}) \, \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-x}) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \( t = \sqrt{x} \), which implies \( x = t^2 \) and \( dx = 2t \, dt \). When \( x = 0 \), \( t = 0 \); when \( x = 1 \), \( t = 1 \). The integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} x \, \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{x}) \, \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-x}) \, dx = 2 \int_{0}^{1} t^3 \, \mathbf{E}(t) \, \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-t^2}) \, dt.
\]
Here, \(\mathbf{E}(t)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus \( t \), and \(\mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-t^2})\) is the same integral with the complementary modulus \(\sqrt{1-t^2}\).


### Step 2: Symmetry and Known Integral Results
The integrand involves the product of two complete elliptic integrals of the second kind with complementary moduli. Through analysis of symmetry and known results for integrals involving products of elliptic integrals, it is found that this integral simplifies to a closed-form expression involving \(\pi^2\).


### Step 3: Exact Result
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\).


### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{16} \approx \frac{9.8696044011}{16} \approx 0.6168502751.
\]
