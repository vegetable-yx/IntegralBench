To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(0.5\sqrt{x}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Approach
The integrand involves the product of two complete elliptic integrals: \(\mathbf{K}\) (first kind) and \(\mathbf{E}\) (second kind). The arguments of these integrals are \(\sqrt{1-x}\) and \(0.5\sqrt{x}\), respectively. 

- **Substitution**: Let \(t = \sqrt{x}\), so \(x = t^2\) and \(dx = 2t \, dt\). The limits \(x \in [0,1]\) transform to \(t \in [0,1]\). The integral becomes:
  \[
  2 \int_0^1 t \cdot \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-t^2}\right) \cdot \mathbf{E}\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) dt
  \]

- **Elliptic Integral Properties**: \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) and \(\mathbf{E}(k)\) have series expansions and hypergeometric representations, but directly integrating their product analytically is non-trivial due to the complexity of their interactions.


### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
Given the difficulty of an analytical solution, we use numerical integration. The integrand is smooth except near \(x=0\), where \(\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\) has a logarithmic singularity, but the integral remains convergent. 

Using numerical methods (e.g., adaptive quadrature or specialized software like Wolfram Alpha), the integral is approximated. The result is:


### Final Result
The exact analytical form is not straightforward, but the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:
