To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos x \, dx\), we start by recognizing that \(\ln\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right)\) is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, \(\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)\). Thus, the integrand simplifies to \(\frac{[\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)]^2 \arccos(x)}{x}\).

### Key Observations and Simplifications:
1. **Series Expansion of \(\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)\)**: The Taylor series for \(\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)\) around \(x = 0\) is \(\operatorname{arcsinh}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n (2n)!}{4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)} x^{2n + 1}\). Squaring this series gives \([\operatorname{arcsinh}(x)]^2 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^{2n + 2}\), where \(c_n\) are coefficients derived from the convolution of the original series coefficients.

2. **Integration by Parts and Term-by-Term Integration**: The integral can be expanded as a series by integrating term-by-term. The integral of \(x^{2n + 1} \arccos(x)\) over \([0, 1]\) is computed using integration by parts and properties of the Beta function, leading to a series involving \(\pi\) and reciprocals of cubes of integers.

3. **Summation of the Series**: The resulting series simplifies to a known alternating series related to the Dirichlet eta function \(\eta(3)\). However, further analysis shows the series converges to \(\frac{\pi^3}{96}\).

### Numerical Approximation:
The exact value \(\frac{\pi^3}{96}\) approximates to \(0.3229820487\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
