To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^2 x^{1/2} I_0\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2-x)}\right) dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \(x = 1 + t\), which transforms the interval \([0, 2]\) to \([-1, 1]\). This simplifies \(x(2-x)\) to \(1 - t^2\), and the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^1 (1 + t)^{1/2} I_0\left((1 - t^2)^{1/4}\right) dt
\]
Splitting the integral into \([-1, 0]\) and \([0, 1]\) and substituting \(t \to -t\) in the first part, we rewrite it as:
\[
\int_0^1 \left[\sqrt{1 - t} + \sqrt{1 + t}\right] I_0\left((1 - t^2)^{1/4}\right) dt
\]

### Step 2: Further Substitution
Next, let \(z = (1 - t^2)^{1/4}\), so \(t^2 = 1 - z^4\) and \(dt = \frac{-2z^3}{\sqrt{1 - z^4}} dz\). The integrand \(\sqrt{1 - t} + \sqrt{1 + t}\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{2(1 + z^2)}\) (verified by squaring and simplifying). Substituting these into the integral, we find:
\[
2\sqrt{2} \int_0^1 \frac{z^3}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} I_0(z) dz
\]

### Step 3: Power Series and Integration
Using the power series expansion of \(I_0(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(z^2/4)^n}{(n!)^2}\), we interchange the sum and integral (justified by uniform convergence). The integral reduces to evaluating a series involving Beta functions, which simplifies to:
\[
4\sqrt{2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2n + 3)(2n + 1)!}
\]

### Step 4: Evaluating the Series
Recognizing the series as an integral involving \(\sinh(t)\), we use integration by parts to show the series sums to \(e^{-1}\). Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{e}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{e}\) is approximately \(2.0810026159\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
