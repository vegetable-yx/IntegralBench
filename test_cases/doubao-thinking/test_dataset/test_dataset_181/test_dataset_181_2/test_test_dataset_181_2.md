To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} \frac{1}{x^2(2-x)^2} J_{1.5}(x) J_{1.5}(2-x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Considerations
The integrand involves Bessel functions of the first kind with half-integer order \(1.5\) (i.e., \(J_{3/2}\)). Bessel functions of half-integer order have closed-form expressions in terms of trigonometric functions:
\[
J_{3/2}(z) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} \left( \frac{\sin z}{z} - \cos z \right).
\]
Substituting this into the integrand and expanding the product leads to complicated terms involving powers of \(x\), \(2-x\), and trigonometric functions. However, analytical evaluation of the resulting integral is intractable due to the singular behavior of the denominator \(x^2(2-x)^2\) near \(x=0\) and \(x=2\), combined with the oscillatory nature of the Bessel functions.


### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The integral is evaluated numerically using adaptive quadrature, which handles singularities at the endpoints. The integrand is positive over \((0, 2)\) and behaves like \(x^{-1/2}\) near \(x=0\) and \((2-x)^{-1/2}\) near \(x=2\), both of which are integrable. Using numerical integration tools (e.g., `scipy.integrate.quad` in Python), the integral is approximated.


### Result
The exact answer cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is:
