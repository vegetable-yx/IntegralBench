To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-0.5^2x}\,\mathbf{E}\left(0.5\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\,dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves the product of two elliptic integrals of the second kind, \(\mathbf{E}(k)\), where \(k\) is the modulus. The elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{E}(k) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\theta}\,d\theta
\]
for \(0 \leq k \leq 1\). 

The integrand is \(\frac{1}{1 - x/4} \cdot \mathbf{E}\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}\right) \cdot \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\). By expressing the elliptic integrals as integrals over \(\theta\) and \(\phi\), we rewrite the product \(\mathbf{E}\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}\right) \cdot \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\) as a double integral. Switching the order of integration (integrating over \(x\) first, then \(\theta\) and \(\phi\)) and simplifying the inner integral over \(x\) leads to recognizing that the result simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\).


### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\) is approximately \(2.46740110027\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.


### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\), and its numerical approximation is approximately \(2.4674011003\).
