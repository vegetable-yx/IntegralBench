To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^{1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} \arcsin\left(0.5\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \(x = 1 + \sin\theta\), which transforms the interval \(x \in [0, 2]\) to \(\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]\). This substitution simplifies \(x(2 - x)\) to \(\cos^2\theta\), so \(\sqrt{x(2 - x)} = \cos\theta\) (since \(\cos\theta \geq 0\) in \([-\pi/2, \pi/2]\)). The argument of \(\arcsin\) becomes \(0.5\cos\theta\).

The integrand \(x^{1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2}\) simplifies to \(\frac{1 + \sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\) (using trigonometric identities). The differential \(dx = \cos\theta \, d\theta\), so the integrand becomes \((1 + \sin\theta) \arcsin(0.5\cos\theta)\).

### Step 2: Symmetry and Simplifying the Integral
The integral splits into two parts: \(\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \arcsin(0.5\cos\theta) \, d\theta + \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \sin\theta \arcsin(0.5\cos\theta) \, d\theta\). The second integral is odd about \(\theta = 0\) and vanishes over symmetric limits. The first integral is even, so it reduces to \(2\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \arcsin(0.5\cos\theta) \, d\theta\).

### Step 3: Further Substitution and Integration
Using \(\phi = \pi/2 - \theta\), the integral transforms to \(2\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \arcsin(0.5\sin\phi) \, d\phi\). Differentiating under the integral sign and using properties of the dilogarithm function \(Li_2(z)\), we find that the integral simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\).

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\) approximates to \(1.6449340668\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
