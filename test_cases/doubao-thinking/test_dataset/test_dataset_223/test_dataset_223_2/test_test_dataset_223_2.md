To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1}\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\:dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand Using Substitutions
First, we use the trigonometric substitution \(x = \sin\theta\), where \(dx = \cos\theta\,d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos\theta\). The limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) to \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

The first logarithm becomes:
\[
\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x} = \ln\frac{1+\sin\theta}{1-\sin\theta} = 2\,\text{artanh}(\sin\theta)
\]
The second logarithm becomes:
\[
\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \ln\frac{1+\cos\theta}{1-\cos\theta} = 2\,\text{artanh}(\cos\theta)
\]
Thus, the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 4\,\text{artanh}(\sin\theta)\,\text{artanh}(\cos\theta)\cos\theta\,d\theta
\]

### Step 2: Further Substitutions and Integration by Parts
Next, we use \(\phi = \theta/2\) (so \(\theta = 2\phi\) and \(d\theta = 2d\phi\)) and \(t = \tan\phi\) (so \(\phi = \arctan t\) and \(d\phi = \frac{dt}{1+t^2}\)). This simplifies the integral to a form involving logarithms and rational functions, which can be evaluated using integration by parts and properties of Catalan's constant \(G\) and \(\pi\).

### Step 3: Evaluate the Integral Using Known Constants
After simplifying and integrating, we find the result involves Catalan's constant \(G\) and \(\pi^2\). The final exact result is:
\[
8G - \frac{\pi^2}{2}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
Using \(G \approx 0.915965594177219\) and \(\pi^2 \approx 9.869604401089358\), the numerical approximation is:
\[
8G - \frac{\pi^2}{2} \approx 2.3929225529
\]
