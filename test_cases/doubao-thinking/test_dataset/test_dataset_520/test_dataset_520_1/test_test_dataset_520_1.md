To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))\,dx\), we analyze the symmetry of the integrand \(\tan(\cos(x))\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).

### Step 1: Symmetry Analysis
The function \(\cos(x)\) is symmetric about \(x = \pi\), meaning \(\cos(2\pi - x) = \cos(x)\). However, \(\tan(\cos(x))\) has additional symmetry properties. Consider the substitution \(x = \pi - t\) in the integral over \([0, \pi]\):
\[
\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = \int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(\pi - t))\,dt = \int_0^\pi \tan(-\cos(t))\,dt = -\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(t))\,dt.
\]
This implies \(\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = -\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(x))\,dx\), so \(\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = 0\).

### Step 2: Integral Over \([\pi, 2\pi]\)
For the interval \([\pi, 2\pi]\), use the substitution \(x = \pi + t\) (where \(t \in [0, \pi]\)):
\[
\int_\pi^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = \int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(\pi + t))\,dt = \int_0^\pi \tan(-\cos(t))\,dt = -\int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(t))\,dt = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Total Integral
Adding the results over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\), the total integral is:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = 0 + 0 = 0.
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact value is \(0\). Numerically, integrating \(\tan(\cos(x))\) over \([0, 2\pi]\) confirms the result is extremely close to \(0\). Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
