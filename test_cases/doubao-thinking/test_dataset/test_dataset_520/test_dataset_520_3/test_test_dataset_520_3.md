To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))\,dx\), we analyze the symmetry of the integrand and use substitution to simplify the integral.

### Step 1: Symmetry Analysis
The integrand is \(\tan(\cos(x))\). Consider splitting the integral into two intervals: \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\).

For the interval \([\pi, 2\pi]\), use the substitution \(x = \pi + t\), where \(t\) ranges from \(0\) to \(\pi\). Then:
\[
\cos(x) = \cos(\pi + t) = -\cos(t)
\]
Since \(\tan\) is an odd function (\(\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)\)), we have:
\[
\tan(\cos(x)) = \tan(-\cos(t)) = -\tan(\cos(t))
\]
Thus, the integral over \([\pi, 2\pi]\) becomes:
\[
\int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = \int_0^{\pi} -\tan(\cos(t))\,dt = -\int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(t))\,dt
\]

### Step 2: Combining Intervals
The original integral is the sum of the integrals over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\):
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx
\]
Substituting the result from the second interval:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx - \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\,dx = 0
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
Since the exact value of the integral is \(0\), the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is also \(0.0000000000\).
