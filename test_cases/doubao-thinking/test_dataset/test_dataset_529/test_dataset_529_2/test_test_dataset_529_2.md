To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor \, dx\), we analyze the behavior of the floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). 

### Key Observations:
1. The function \(2023\sin(x)\) oscillates between \(-2023\) and \(2023\) over \([0, 2\pi]\).
2. The floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) takes integer values \(k\) where \(k \leq 2023\sin(x) < k+1\).
3. The integral of a step function (like the floor function here) is the sum of the product of each constant value \(k\) and the length of the interval where \(k\) is taken.

### Analysis of Intervals:
- For \(x \in [0, \pi]\), \(\sin(x) \geq 0\), so \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2023\). The floor function takes non-negative integer values \(0, 1, \ldots, 2023\).
- For \(x \in [\pi, 2\pi]\), \(\sin(x) \leq 0\), so \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(0\) to \(-2023\). The floor function takes non-positive integer values \(0, -1, \ldots, -2023\).

### Symmetry and Simplification:
By examining the symmetry of \(\sin(x)\) and the linearity of the integral, we find that the positive contributions from \(k \geq 1\) in \([0, \pi]\) cancel with the negative contributions from \(k \leq -1\) in \([\pi, 2\pi]\), leaving only a residual term. This residual term simplifies to \(-\pi\) due to the periodicity and symmetry of \(\sin(x)\).

### Conclusion:
The integral simplifies to \(-\pi\).

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of \(-\pi\) rounded to 10 decimal places is \(-3.1415926536\).
