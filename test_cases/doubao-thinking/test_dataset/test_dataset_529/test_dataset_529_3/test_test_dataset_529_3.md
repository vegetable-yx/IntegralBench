To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor \, dx\), we analyze the behavior of the floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). 

### Key Observations:
1. **Range of \(2023\sin(x)\):** Since \(\sin(x) \in [-1, 1]\), \(2023\sin(x) \in [-2023, 2023]\). The floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) takes integer values from \(-2023\) to \(2023\).
2. **Symmetry:** The function \(\sin(x)\) is symmetric about \(x = \pi/2\) in \([0, \pi]\) and about \(x = 3\pi/2\) in \([\pi, 2\pi]\). This symmetry allows us to split the integral into intervals where the floor function is constant and exploit telescoping sums.
3. **Telescoping Sums:** When summing the contributions of each constant interval, the terms involving \(\arcsin\) cancel out, leaving a simplified result.

### Detailed Calculation:
- **Integral over \([0, \pi]\):** Here, \(\sin(x) \geq 0\), so \(2023\sin(x) \in [0, 2023]\). The floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) takes values \(0, 1, \ldots, 2022\) (since \(2023\sin(x) = 2023\) only at \(x = \pi/2\), a single point with measure zero).
- **Integral over \([\pi, 2\pi]\):** Here, \(\sin(x) \leq 0\), so \(2023\sin(x) \in [-2023, 0]\). The floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) takes values \(-1, -2, \ldots, -2023\).

By analyzing the symmetry and using telescoping sums, the contributions from the positive and negative intervals cancel out except for a constant term. This leads to the result that the integral over \([0, 2\pi]\) simplifies to \(-\pi\).

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of \(-\pi\) is approximately \(-3.1415926536\).
