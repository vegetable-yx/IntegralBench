To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor \, dx\), we analyze the behavior of the floor function \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). 

### Key Observations:
1. The function \(\sin(x)\) has a period of \(2\pi\) and ranges from \(-1\) to \(1\). Thus, \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(-2023\) to \(2023\).
2. The floor function \(\lfloor y \rfloor\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(y\). For \(y = 2023\sin(x)\), \(\lfloor y \rfloor\) takes integer values from \(-2023\) to \(2022\).
3. The integral can be split into intervals where \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) is constant. Due to the symmetry of \(\sin(x)\) over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\), the positive and negative contributions of the floor function cancel out except for a residual term.

### Detailed Analysis:
- Over \([0, \pi]\), \(\sin(x)\) is non-negative, so \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2023\). The floor function here takes values \(0, 1, \ldots, 2022\) (since \(2023\sin(x) = 2023\) only at \(x = \pi/2\), a single point with measure zero).
- Over \([\pi, 2\pi]\), \(\sin(x)\) is non-positive, so \(2023\sin(x)\) ranges from \(-2023\) to \(0\). The floor function here takes values \(-1, -2, \ldots, -2023\).

### Summation and Cancellation:
By analyzing the intervals where \(\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor\) is constant and summing their contributions, we find that the positive and negative terms involving sums of arcsine functions cancel out. This leaves a residual term of \(-\pi\).

### Result:
The integral simplifies to \(-\pi\).

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of \(-\pi\) is approximately \(-3.1415926536\).
