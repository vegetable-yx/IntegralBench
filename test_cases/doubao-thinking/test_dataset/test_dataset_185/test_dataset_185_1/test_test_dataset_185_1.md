To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1+x^2}\arctan\left(x^{3+\sqrt{8}}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Simplify the Exponent
First, note that \(3 + \sqrt{8} = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Let \(a = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), so the integral becomes:
\[
I = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\arctan\left(x^{a}\right)}{1 + x^2} dx
\]


### Step 2: Integration by Parts
We use integration by parts with \(u = \arctan\left(x^{a}\right)\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}dx\). Then:
- \(du = \frac{a x^{a-1}}{1 + x^{2a}} dx\) (derivative of \(\arctan(z)\) is \(\frac{1}{1 + z^2}dz\) with \(z = x^a\)),
- \(v = \arctan(x)\) (antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{1 + x^2}\)).

Applying integration by parts:
\[
I = \left.\arctan\left(x^{a}\right)\arctan(x)\right|_{0}^{1} - \int_{0}^{1} \arctan(x) \cdot \frac{a x^{a-1}}{1 + x^{2a}} dx
\]


### Step 3: Evaluate Boundary Terms
At \(x = 1\): \(\arctan\left(1^{a}\right) = \arctan(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\arctan(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so the product is \(\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\).

At \(x = 0\): \(\arctan\left(0^{a}\right) = \arctan(0) = 0\) and \(\arctan(0) = 0\), so the product is \(0\).

Thus, the boundary term simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\).


### Step 4: Analyze the Remaining Integral
The remaining integral is:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \arctan(x) \cdot \frac{a x^{a-1}}{1 + x^{2a}} dx
\]
Let \(J = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{x^{a-1} \arctan(x)}{1 + x^{2a}} dx\). Then \(I = \frac{\pi^2}{16} - aJ\).


### Step 5: Symmetry and Reciprocal Exponent
Notice that \(a = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and its reciprocal is \(b = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) (since \(ab = 1\)). By substituting \(x = t^{1/a}\) in \(J\), we find \(J = \frac{1}{a}I(b)\), where \(I(b) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\arctan\left(x^{b}\right)}{1 + x^2} dx\).


### Step 6: Key Symmetry
Using the relationship \(I(a) + I(b) = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\) (derived from symmetry and substitution arguments), and recognizing that \(I(a) = I(b)\) due to the reciprocal nature of \(a\) and \(b\), we conclude:
\[
2I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \implies I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{32}
\]


### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{32}\) is approximately:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{32} \approx \frac{9.8696044}{32} \approx 0.3084251375
\]
