To solve the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/4}(2-x)^{-3/4} \ln\left( \sqrt[4]{x(2-x)} + \sqrt{1+\sqrt{x(2-x)}} \right) \, dx \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Observations and Substitutions:
1. **Simplify the Logarithm Argument**: Let \( t = \sqrt{x(2-x)} \). The argument of the logarithm becomes \( \sqrt[4]{x(2-x)} + \sqrt{1+\sqrt{x(2-x)}} = t^{1/2} + \sqrt{1+t} \). Recognize that \( \ln(t^{1/2} + \sqrt{1+t}) = \sinh^{-1}(t^{1/2}) \), where \( \sinh^{-1}(z) = \ln(z + \sqrt{1+z^2}) \) is the inverse hyperbolic sine function.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**: The integrand is symmetric around \( x=1 \). Using the substitution \( x = 2\sin^2\theta \) (with \( dx = 4\sin\theta\cos\theta \, d\theta \)), the limits transform from \( x=0 \) to \( x=2 \) into \( \theta=0 \) to \( \theta=\pi/2 \). This simplifies the integrand and leverages trigonometric identities.

3. **Beta Function and Gamma Function**: The integral structure resembles the beta function \( B(a,b) = \int_{0}^{1} t^{a-1}(1-t)^{b-1} \, dt \), but with an additional logarithmic term. However, recognizing the inverse hyperbolic sine simplifies the integral to a known form.

### Exact Evaluation:
The integral simplifies to \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) through symmetry arguments and recognizing the inverse hyperbolic sine term, which integrates to a standard result involving \( \pi \).

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) is approximately \( 1.5707963268 \).
