The integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \mathbf{L}_0(\sqrt{x}) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx\) involves the product of \(\mathbf{L}_0(\sqrt{x})\) (assumed to be the complete elliptic integral of the first kind \(K(\sqrt{x})\) here) and \(\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)\) (the complete elliptic integral of the second kind). Analyzing the behavior near \(x \to 0^+\), the integrand behaves like \(\frac{\pi}{2x}\) (since \(K(\sqrt{x}) \sim \frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \sim 1\) for small \(x\)), leading to a non-integrable singularity at \(x=0\). Thus, the integral diverges.
