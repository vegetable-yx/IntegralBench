The integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \mathbf{L}_0(\sqrt{x}) \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx\) involves a function \(\mathbf{L}_0\) whose definition is unclear. Assuming \(\mathbf{L}_0\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind \(K\) (a common notation ambiguity), the integrand exhibits a singularity at \(x \to 0^+\). Analysis of the integrand's behavior near \(x=0\) shows the leading term behaves like \(\frac{\pi}{2x}\), leading to a divergent integral when integrated over \([0,1]\). 

Thus, the integral diverges.
