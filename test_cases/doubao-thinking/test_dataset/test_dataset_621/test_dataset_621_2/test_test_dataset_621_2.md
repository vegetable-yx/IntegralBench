To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\ln(\sin x)}{\cos^2x}\mathrm{d}x\), we use integration by parts. 

### Step 1: Choose \(u\) and \(dv\)
Let \(u = \ln(\sin x)\) and \(dv = \sec^2 x \, dx\) (since \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \sec^2 x\)). 

### Step 2: Compute \(du\) and \(v\)
- \(du = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} \, dx = \cot x \, dx\) (by differentiating \(u\)).
- \(v = \tan x\) (by integrating \(dv\)).

### Step 3: Apply Integration by Parts
The integration by parts formula is \(\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\). Evaluating \(uv\) over the bounds \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) and subtracting \(\int v \, du\):

1. **Evaluate \(uv\) at the bounds**:
   - At \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\): \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) is undefined (approaches \(\infty\)), but \(\ln(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)) = \ln(1) = 0\). The limit \(\lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}^-} \tan x \cdot \ln(\sin x)\) is \(0\) (via L'Hospital's Rule).
   - At \(x = 0\): \(\tan(0) = 0\), and \(\ln(\sin 0)\) approaches \(-\infty\). The limit \(\lim_{x \to 0^+} \tan x \cdot \ln(\sin x)\) is \(0\) (since \(x \ln x \to 0\) as \(x \to 0^+\)).

   Thus, \(uv\) evaluated over \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) is \(0 - 0 = 0\).

2. **Compute \(\int v \, du\)**:
   \[
   \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} v \, du = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \tan x \cdot \cot x \, dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, dx = \left[x\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

### Step 4: Combine Results
The original integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\ln(\sin x)}{\cos^2x}\mathrm{d}x = 0 - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{2}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) is approximately \(-1.5707963268\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).
