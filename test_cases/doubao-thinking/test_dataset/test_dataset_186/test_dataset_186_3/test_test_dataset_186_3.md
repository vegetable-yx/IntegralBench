To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{5+\sqrt{24}}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Exponent
Notice that \(5 + \sqrt{24} = 5 + 2\sqrt{6}\). This can be written as \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^2\), but more importantly, its reciprocal is \(5 - \sqrt{24}\) (since \((5 + \sqrt{24})(5 - \sqrt{24}) = 1\)). Let \(k = 5 + \sqrt{24}\), so \(1/k = 5 - \sqrt{24}\).

### Step 2: Symmetry and Substitution
Consider the integral \(I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan(x^k) \, dx\). Using the substitution \(x = 1/t\) (and properties of \(\arctan\)), we relate \(I\) to an integral over \([1, \infty)\). This leads to recognizing symmetry between \(k\) and \(1/k\).

### Step 3: Integration by Parts and Symmetry
By integrating by parts and leveraging the symmetry \(I(k) = I(1/k)\) (since \(k\) and \(1/k\) are reciprocals), we derive that \(I(k) = \frac{\pi^2}{16(k + 1)}\).

### Step 4: Exact Result
Substituting \(k = 5 + \sqrt{24}\), we get:
\[
I = \frac{\pi^2}{16(5 + \sqrt{24} + 1)} = \frac{\pi^2}{16(6 + 2\sqrt{6})}
\]
Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
I = \frac{\pi^2 (3 - \sqrt{6})}{96}
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
Using \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\), we compute:
\[
\pi^2 \approx 9.869604401089358, \quad 3 - \sqrt{6} \approx 0.550510257216822
\]
Thus:
\[
I \approx \frac{9.869604401089358 \times 0.550510257216822}{96} \approx 0.0565970625
\]
