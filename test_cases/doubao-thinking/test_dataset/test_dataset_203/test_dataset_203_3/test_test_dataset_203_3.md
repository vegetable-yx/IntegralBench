To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Argument of the Cosine
First, rewrite the expression under the square root:
\[
x(2-x) = 2x - x^2 = 1 - (x-1)^2
\]
This is a key simplification, as it transforms the argument of the cosine into \(\sqrt{1 - (x-1)^2}\), which is symmetric around \(x=1\).

### Step 2: Substitution to Exploit Symmetry
Let \(t = x - 1\), so \(x = t + 1\) and \(dx = dt\). The limits of integration change from \(x=0\) to \(x=2\) to \(t=-1\) to \(t=1\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} (t+1)^2 \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]
Expanding \((t+1)^2\) gives \(t^2 + 2t + 1\), so the integral splits into three terms:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} (t^2 + 2t + 1) \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt = \int_{-1}^{1} t^2 \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt + 2 \int_{-1}^{1} t \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt + \int_{-1}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 3: Simplify Odd and Even Integrals
The second term involves an odd function (\(t \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right)\)) integrated over symmetric limits, which vanishes:
\[
2 \int_{-1}^{1} t \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt = 0
\]
The remaining terms involve even functions, so we can rewrite them as twice the integral from \(0\) to \(1\):
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} (t^2 + 1) \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt = 2 \int_{0}^{1} (t^2 + 1) \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) \, dt
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Analytical evaluation of the remaining integral is non-trivial, as it involves special functions or infinite series. Instead, we use numerical integration. Using high-precision numerical methods (e.g., adaptive quadrature), the integral approximates to:

### Final Result
The exact answer cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, so we present the integral itself as the exact form. The numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is:
