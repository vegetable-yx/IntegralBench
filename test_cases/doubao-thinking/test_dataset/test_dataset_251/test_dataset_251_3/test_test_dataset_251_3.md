To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^{2} x^{-1} \arctan\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Argument of the Arctangent
First, rewrite the argument inside the arctangent:
\[
\sqrt{x(2-x)} = \sqrt{2x - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - (x-1)^2}
\]
This suggests a substitution centered around \(x = 1\). Let \(t = x - 1\), so \(x = t + 1\) and \(dx = dt\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{t + 1} \arctan\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) dt
\]
However, symmetry considerations (substituting \(x \to 2 - x\)) show the integral is symmetric around \(x = 1\), so we focus on simplifying the integrand further.

### Step 2: Substitution and Symmetry
Let \(t = \sqrt{x(2 - x)}\), so \(t^2 = x(2 - x)\). Solving for \(x\) gives \(x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2}\). The integral splits into two parts (from \(x = 0\) to \(1\) and \(x = 1\) to \(2\)), which combine to:
\[
2 \int_0^1 \frac{\arctan(t)}{t \sqrt{1 - t^2}} dt
\]

### Step 3: Trigonometric Substitution
Let \(t = \sin\theta\), so \(dt = \cos\theta d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - t^2} = \cos\theta\). The integral transforms to:
\[
2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\arctan(\sin\theta)}{\sin\theta} d\theta
\]

### Step 4: Series Expansion and Integration
Using the series expansion \(\arctan(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{2n+1}\) for \(|z| \leq 1\), we substitute \(z = \sin\theta\) and interchange summation and integration (justified by uniform convergence):
\[
2 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2n}\theta d\theta
\]
The integral \(\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2n}\theta d\theta\) is a Wallis integral, equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(2n)!}{4^n (n!)^2}\). Substituting this and simplifying the series using generating functions, we find the sum converges to \(2 \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)\).

### Step 5: Final Result
Thus, the integral evaluates to:
\[
2\pi \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \approx 0.48121182506\), so:
\[
2\pi \times 0.48121182506 \approx 3.0202932556
\]
