To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^3 \arccos x \arcsin^2 x \, dx\), we start by using the substitution \(x = \sin \theta\), where \(\theta = \arcsin x\). This transforms the integral into terms of \(\theta\) with \(dx = \cos \theta \, d\theta\), and the limits change from \(x=0\) to \(\theta=0\) and \(x=1\) to \(\theta=\pi/2\). 

### Key Substitutions and Simplifications:
- \(\arcsin x = \theta\)
- \(\arccos x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\) (since \(\arccos x + \arcsin x = \frac{\pi}{2}\))
- \(x^3 = \sin^3 \theta\)
- \(dx = \cos \theta \, d\theta\)

The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sin^3 \theta \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) \theta^2 \cos \theta \, d\theta
\]

Expanding \(\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) \theta^2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \theta^2 - \theta^3\), the integral splits into two parts:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \theta^2 \sin^3 \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta - \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \theta^3 \sin^3 \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta
\]

### Evaluating the Integrals:
For both integrals, we use the substitution \(u = \sin^4 \theta\), so \(du = 4 \sin^3 \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta\) (i.e., \(\sin^3 \theta \cos \theta \, d\theta = \frac{du}{4}\)). Integration by parts is applied to each term, leveraging the antiderivative of \(\sin^4 \theta\) and simplifying the resulting expressions.

### Simplification and Combination:
After evaluating the integrals and combining the results, the \(\pi^3\) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
\frac{19\pi}{512}
\]

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical value of \(\frac{19\pi}{512}\) is approximately \(0.1165825400\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
