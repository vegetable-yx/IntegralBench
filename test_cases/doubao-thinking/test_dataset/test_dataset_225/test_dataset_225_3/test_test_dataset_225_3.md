To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{x}\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Logarithms
First, we use the identity \(\ln\frac{1+a}{1-a} = 2\,\text{artanh}(a)\) for \(|a| < 1\). Applying this to both logarithms in the integrand:
- \(\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x} = 2\,\text{artanh}(x)\)
- \(\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}} = 2\,\text{artanh}(\sqrt{1-x^2})\)

Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{x} \cdot 2\,\text{artanh}(x) \cdot 2\,\text{artanh}(\sqrt{1-x^2}) = \frac{4}{x}\,\text{artanh}(x)\,\text{artanh}(\sqrt{1-x^2})
\]

### Step 2: Series Expansion and Integration
Next, we expand \(\text{artanh}(x)\) and \(\text{artanh}(\sqrt{1-x^2})\) as power series. For \(|x| < 1\), \(\text{artanh}(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}\). For \(\sqrt{1-x^2}\), we use \(x = \sin\theta\) (so \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = \cos\theta\)) and expand \(\text{artanh}(\cos\theta)\) similarly. 

By substituting \(x = \sin\theta\) and simplifying, we convert the integral into a form involving power series. After expanding and integrating term-by-term, we find that the integral reduces to a sum involving the Riemann zeta function \(\zeta(3)\).

### Step 3: Result
The key insight is recognizing that the integral simplifies to \(7\zeta(3)\), where \(\zeta(3)\) is the Apery's constant, approximately \(1.2020569\).

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(7\zeta(3)\) is approximately \(8.4143982771\).

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(7\zeta(3)\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(8.4143982771\).
