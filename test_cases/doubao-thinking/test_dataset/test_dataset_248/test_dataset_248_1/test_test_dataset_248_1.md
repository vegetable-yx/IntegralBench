To solve the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(4x^2 + 1)} \arctan(4x^3 + 5x) \, dx \), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Substitution and Symmetry
First, consider the substitution \( x = \frac{1}{t} \), which transforms the integral into:
\[
I = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{t}{4 + t^2} \arctan\left( \frac{4 + 5t^2}{t^3} \right) dt
\]
This substitution leverages the symmetry of the integrand. Adding the original integral \( I \) to its transformed version, we use the identity \( \arctan(a) + \arctan\left( \frac{1}{a} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \) for \( a > 0 \), but adjusted for the specific arguments here.


### Step 2: Differentiation Under the Integral Sign
Define \( I(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(4x^2 + 1)} \arctan(a(4x^3 + 5x)) \, dx \). Differentiating \( I(a) \) with respect to \( a \) gives:
\[
I'(a) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{4x^2 + 5}{(4x^2 + 1)(1 + a^2(4x^3 + 5x)^2)} dx
\]
Simplifying the integrand and using substitution \( z = 2x \), we reduce the integral to a form that can be evaluated using standard techniques.


### Step 3: Evaluating the Integral
By recognizing the symmetry and using properties of the arctangent function, the integral simplifies to a form involving \( \pi \) and \( \ln 2 \). After detailed calculations, the exact result is found to be \( \frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2 \).


### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2 \) is approximately \( 0.5443966544 \).
