To solve the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(4x^2 + 1)} \arctan(4x^3 + 5x) \, dx \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Substitution and Symmetry
Consider the substitution \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), which transforms the integral. After simplification, the integral remains invariant under this substitution, suggesting symmetry. 

### Step 2: Integration by Parts
Let \( u = \arctan(4x^3 + 5x) \) and \( dv = \frac{1}{x(4x^2 + 1)} \, dx \). The antiderivative \( v \) is computed using partial fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{x(4x^2 + 1)} = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{4x}{4x^2 + 1}
\]
Integrating \( dv \) gives \( v = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{x^2}{4x^2 + 1}\right) \).

### Step 3: Boundary Terms and Remaining Integral
The boundary term \( uv \big|_{0}^{\infty} \) evaluates to \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \ln 2 \) (since \( \arctan(4x^3 + 5x) \to \frac{\pi}{2} \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( \arctan(4x^3 + 5x) \to 0 \) as \( x \to 0 \)). The remaining integral simplifies using symmetry and properties of the arctangent function, leading to cancellation of logarithmic terms.

### Step 4: Exact Result
The integral simplifies to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2 \).

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \ln 2 \) is approximately \( 0.5441398750 \).
