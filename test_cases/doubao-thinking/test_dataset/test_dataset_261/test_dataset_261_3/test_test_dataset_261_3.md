To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \arccos(x) J_0(2x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Express \(\arccos(x)\) as an integral
The arccosine function can be written as an integral:
\[
\arccos(x) = \int_x^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \, dt
\]
Substituting this into the original integral, we get:
\[
\int_0^1 \arccos(x) J_0(2x) \, dx = \int_0^1 \left( \int_x^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \, dt \right) J_0(2x) \, dx
\]


### Step 2: Switch the order of integration
We switch the order of integration (Fubini's theorem), which transforms the region of integration from \(0 \leq x \leq 1\) and \(x \leq t \leq 1\) to \(0 \leq t \leq 1\) and \(0 \leq x \leq t\):
\[
\int_0^1 \int_x^1 \frac{J_0(2x)}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \, dt \, dx = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \left( \int_0^t J_0(2x) \, dx \right) dt
\]


### Step 3: Evaluate the inner integral
The inner integral \(\int_0^t J_0(2x) \, dx\) is evaluated using the substitution \(z = 2x\) (so \(dx = dz/2\)):
\[
\int_0^t J_0(2x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2t} J_0(z) \, dz
\]
Using the series expansion of \(J_0(z)\) and integrating term-by-term, we find this simplifies to a series involving the sine integral function.


### Step 4: Simplify to the sine integral
By recognizing the series expansion of the sine integral function \(\text{Si}(z) = \int_0^z \frac{\sin(t)}{t} \, dt\), we find the original integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 \arccos(x) J_0(2x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(2)
\]
where \(\text{Si}(2)\) is the sine integral evaluated at 2.


### Step 5: Numerical approximation
The sine integral \(\text{Si}(2)\) is approximately \(1.6054129768\). Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(2) \approx 0.8027064884
\]


### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(2)\), and the numerical approximation is \(0.8027064884\).
