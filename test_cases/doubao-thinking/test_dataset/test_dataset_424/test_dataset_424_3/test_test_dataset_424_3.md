To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023}\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Identify the symmetry of the integrand
The integrand is \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\). To determine if \(f(x)\) is even or odd, we check \(f(-x)\):
\[
f(-x) = \frac{\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} = -f(x).
\]
Thus, \(f(x)\) is an **odd function**.

### Step 2: Use symmetry of the interval
The integral is over the symmetric interval \([-2023, 2023]\). For any odd function \(f(x)\), the integral over a symmetric interval around zero satisfies:
\[
\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\, dx = 0.
\]
This is because the area under the curve from \(-a\) to \(0\) cancels the area from \(0\) to \(a\) due to the odd symmetry.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\) is odd and the interval \([-2023, 2023]\) is symmetric about zero, the integral evaluates to \(0\).

### Numerical Approximation
The exact result is \(0\), so the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is also \(0.0000000000\).
