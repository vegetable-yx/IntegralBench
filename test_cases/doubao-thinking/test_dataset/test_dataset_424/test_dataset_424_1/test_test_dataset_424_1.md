To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023}\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\, dx\), we analyze the integrand and use properties of odd functions over symmetric intervals.

### Step 1: Identify the nature of the integrand
The integrand is \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\). To determine if \(f(x)\) is even or odd, we check \(f(-x)\):
\[
f(-x) = \frac{\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} = -f(x).
\]
Thus, \(f(x)\) is an **odd function**.

### Step 2: Integrate over a symmetric interval
For an odd function \(f(x)\), the integral over a symmetric interval \([-a, a]\) is always zero:
\[
\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\, dx = 0.
\]
This is because the area under the curve from \(-a\) to \(0\) cancels the area from \(0\) to \(a\) due to the odd symmetry.

### Step 3: Apply the property to the given integral
Here, \(a = 2023\), and the integrand is odd. Therefore:
\[
\int_{-2023}^{2023}\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\, dx = 0.
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact result is \(0\), so the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is \(0.0000000000\).
