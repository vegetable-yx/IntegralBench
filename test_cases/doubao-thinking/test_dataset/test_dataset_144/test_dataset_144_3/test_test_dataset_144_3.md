To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x^2 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Series Expansion of \(I_0(2x)\)
The modified Bessel function of the first kind, \(I_0(z)\), has the series representation:
\[
I_0(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(z^2/4)^n}{(n!)^2}.
\]
For \(z = 2x\), this becomes:
\[
I_0(2x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(x^2)^n}{(n!)^2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}.
\]


### Step 2: Interchange Sum and Integral
Substituting the series into the integral, we interchange the sum and integral (justified by uniform convergence on \([0,1]\)):
\[
\int_0^1 x^2 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n!)^2} \int_0^1 x^{2n+2} \arccos x \, dx.
\]


### Step 3: Evaluate the Inner Integral
Let \(I(k) = \int_0^1 x^k \arccos x \, dx\) with \(k = 2n+2\). Using integration by parts (\(u = \arccos x\), \(dv = x^k dx\)):
\[
I(k) = \left. \frac{x^{k+1}}{k+1} \arccos x \right|_0^1 + \frac{1}{k+1} \int_0^1 \frac{x^{k+1}}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx.
\]
The boundary term vanishes (since \(\arccos 1 = 0\) and \(x^{k+1} = 0\) at \(x=0\)). For the remaining integral, substitute \(t = x^2\) (so \(x = \sqrt{t}\), \(dx = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{t}} dt\)):
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{x^{k+1}}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 t^{(k+1)/2 - 1/2} (1-t)^{-1/2} \, dt = \frac{1}{2} B\left(\frac{k}{2} + 1, \frac{1}{2}\right),
\]
where \(B(a,b)\) is the Beta function. Using \(B(a,b) = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}\) and \(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}\), we find:
\[
I(k) = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2} + 1\right) \sqrt{\pi}}{2(k+1) \Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2} + \frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]


### Step 4: Simplify the Series
For \(k = 2n+2\), \(\frac{k}{2} + 1 = n+2\) and \(\frac{k}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = n + \frac{5}{2}\). Using \(\Gamma(n+2) = (n+1)!\) and properties of the Gamma function for half-integers, we simplify \(I(k)\) and substitute back into the series. After simplification, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 x^2 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4^{n+1} (n+1)^2}{(2n+3)(2n+3)!}.
\]


### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
The series converges rapidly. Summing the first few terms (up to \(n=5\)) gives a numerical approximation of approximately \(0.3465301110\).


### Final Answer
The exact answer is the infinite series, and the numerical approximation is:
