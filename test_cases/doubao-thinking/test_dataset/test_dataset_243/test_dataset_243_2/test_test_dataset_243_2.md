To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x \, K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\). Key properties of \(K_0(x)\) include its integral representation and known integrals involving powers of \(K_0(x)\). 

Using integral representations and symmetry arguments, it is known that integrals of the form \(\int_{0}^{\infty} x \, K_0^{2n}(x) \, dx\) can be evaluated analytically. For \(n=2\) (i.e., \(K_0^4(x)\)), the result simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\). This result is derived from properties of Bessel functions and their integrals, leveraging symmetry and known integral identities for powers of \(K_0(x)\).

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The exact value \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\) can be numerically approximated. Since \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\), we compute:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{16} \approx \frac{(3.141592653589793)^2}{16} \approx \frac{9.869604401089358}{16} \approx 0.6168502750680849
\]
Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is \(0.6168502751\).

### Final Answer
