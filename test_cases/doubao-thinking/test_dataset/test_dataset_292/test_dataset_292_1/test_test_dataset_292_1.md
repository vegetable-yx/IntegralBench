To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Substitution and Simplification
First, we use the substitution \(x = \sin^2\theta\), which implies \(dx = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta d\theta\). When \(x = 0\), \(\theta = 0\), and when \(x = 1\), \(\theta = \pi/2\). The integral transforms to:
\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin\theta\cos\theta \mathbf{K}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{K}(\cos\theta) d\theta
\]

### Step 2: Recognizing Known Integral Results
The product of complete elliptic integrals \(\mathbf{K}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{K}(\cos\theta)\) and the weight \(\sin\theta\cos\theta\) in the integrand suggests a known result from elliptic integral theory. Through analysis and reference to integral tables, it is established that:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin\theta\cos\theta \mathbf{K}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{K}(\cos\theta) d\theta = \frac{\pi^3}{16}
\]

### Step 3: Final Evaluation
Multiplying by the factor of 2 from the substitution, the original integral simplifies to:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{\pi^3}{16} = \frac{\pi^3}{8}
\]

### Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^3}{8}\) is approximately \(3.8757845850\) (rounded to 10 decimal places).

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^3}{8}\), and its numerical approximation is \(3.8757845850\).
