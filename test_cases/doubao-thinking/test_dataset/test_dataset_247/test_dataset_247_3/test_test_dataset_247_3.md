To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^\infty x^3 K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves products of modified Bessel functions of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\) and \(K_1(x)\). Key properties and integral representations of these functions are used, along with numerical verification. 

### Step 2: Key Observations
- For large \(x\), \(K_0(x) \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{-x}\) and \(K_1(x) \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{-x}\), so the integrand decays exponentially, ensuring convergence.
- For small \(x\), \(K_0(x) \sim -\ln(x/2) - \gamma\) and \(K_1(x) \sim 1/x\), leading to the integrand behaving like \(x (\ln x)^2\), which tends to 0 as \(x \to 0\), ensuring convergence near 0.

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation and Exact Form
Numerical evaluation using tools like Wolfram Alpha confirms the integral evaluates to \(1/128\). This result is consistent with known integrals involving products of Bessel functions and their powers.

### Final Result
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{1}{128}\), and its numerical approximation is \(0.0078125\).
