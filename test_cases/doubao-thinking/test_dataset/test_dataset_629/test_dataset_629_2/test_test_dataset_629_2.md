To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{x^{2023} - x^{23}}{\ln x} \, dx\), we can use a key insight involving interchanging the order of integration. 

### Step 1: Recognize the Integral Structure
The integrand \(\frac{x^a - x^b}{\ln x}\) can be expressed as an integral with respect to a parameter. Specifically, note that:
\[
\frac{x^a - x^b}{\ln x} = \int_b^a x^t \, dt
\]
This identity holds because the integral of \(x^t\) with respect to \(t\) is \(\frac{x^t}{\ln x}\), and evaluating from \(t = b\) to \(t = a\) gives the numerator \(x^a - x^b\).

### Step 2: Interchange the Order of Integration
Using this identity, we rewrite the original integral as a double integral:
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{x^{2023} - x^{23}}{\ln x} \, dx = \int_0^1 \left( \int_{23}^{2023} x^t \, dt \right) dx
\]
By Fubini's theorem, we can interchange the order of integration (since the integrand is non-negative and continuous on \((0,1) \times (23, 2023)\)):
\[
\int_{23}^{2023} \left( \int_0^1 x^t \, dx \right) dt
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the Inner Integral
The inner integral \(\int_0^1 x^t \, dx\) is a standard power rule integral:
\[
\int_0^1 x^t \, dx = \left. \frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{t+1}
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Outer Integral
Substituting this result back, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_{23}^{2023} \frac{1}{t+1} \, dt
\]
This is a straightforward integral of \(\frac{1}{t+1}\), which evaluates to:
\[
\left. \ln(t+1) \right|_{23}^{2023} = \ln(2023 + 1) - \ln(23 + 1) = \ln(2024) - \ln(24)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the Result
Using logarithm properties, \(\ln(2024) - \ln(24) = \ln\left( \frac{2024}{24} \right)\). Simplifying \(\frac{2024}{24}\) gives \(\frac{253}{3}\), so the exact result is:
\[
\ln\left( \frac{253}{3} \right)
\]

### Numerical Approximation
To approximate \(\ln\left( \frac{253}{3} \right)\), we first compute \(\frac{253}{3} \approx 84.3333333333\). The natural logarithm of \(84.3333333333\) is approximately \(4.4347854583\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
