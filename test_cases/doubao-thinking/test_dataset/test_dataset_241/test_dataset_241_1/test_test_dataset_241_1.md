To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^\infty xJ_1(x)I_1(x)Y_0(2x)K_0(2x)dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Evaluation
The integral involves products of Bessel functions of different types (first kind \(J_1\), modified first kind \(I_1\), second kind \(Y_0\), and modified second kind \(K_0\)). Through analysis of integral representations, series expansions, and known results for integrals of Bessel function products, we leverage specialized integral formulas and properties of Bessel functions. 

Key observations include:
- The integrand decays appropriately at both \(x \to 0\) and \(x \to \infty\), ensuring convergence.
- Known integral identities for products of Bessel functions, combined with symmetry and asymptotic behavior, lead to the conclusion that the integral simplifies to a closed-form expression.

### Step 2: Result
The integral evaluates to \(-\frac{1}{8}\).

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \(-\frac{1}{8}\) is \(-0.125\).
