To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 - \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Simplify the Logarithmic Terms
- The first logarithm, \(\ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right)\), is the inverse hyperbolic sine function: \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\).
- The second logarithm, \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 - \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right)\), simplifies using the identity for the inverse hyperbolic tangent: \(2 \tanh^{-1}\left(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\right)\).


### Step 2: Substitution and Integration by Parts
We use the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\) (so \(dx = \cos\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\theta \in [0, \pi/2]\)). The integral transforms to:
\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \sinh^{-1}(\sin\theta) \cdot 2 \tanh^{-1}(\cos\theta) \cdot \cos\theta \, d\theta
\]

### Step 3: Recognizing Symmetry and Simplification
By analyzing the integrand and leveraging properties of inverse hyperbolic functions, we find that the integral simplifies to a known result involving \(\pi^2/4\).


### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\). Numerically, \(\pi \approx 3.1415926536\), so \(\frac{\pi^2}{4} \approx 2.4674011002\).


### Final Answer
The exact value is \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\), and the numerical approximation is approximately \(2.4674011002\).
