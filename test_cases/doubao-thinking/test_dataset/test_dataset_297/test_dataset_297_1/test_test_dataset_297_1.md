To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^2 \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{x}) \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{1-x}) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Approach
The integrand involves the product of two complete elliptic integrals of the second kind, \(\operatorname{E}(\sqrt{x})\) and \(\operatorname{E}(\sqrt{1-x})\). The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as:
\[
\operatorname{E}(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta
\]
where \(k\) is the modulus (\(0 \leq k \leq 1\)). Here, \(k_1 = \sqrt{x}\) and \(k_2 = \sqrt{1-x}\), so \(k_1^2 + k_2^2 = 1\) (complementary moduli).

### Step 2: Series Expansion and Integration
The complete elliptic integral of the second kind has a power series expansion for \(|k| < 1\):
\[
\operatorname{E}(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \left[ 1 - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} \right)^2 \frac{k^{2n}}{2n-1} \right]
\]
where \((2n)!! = 2^n n!\) and \((2n-1)!! = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}\). Substituting \(k = \sqrt{x}\) and \(k = \sqrt{1-x}\) into this series, we express the product \(\operatorname{E}(\sqrt{x}) \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{1-x})\) as a double series. Integrating term-by-term over \(x \in [0,1]\) involves evaluating integrals of the form \(\int_0^1 x^2 x^n (1-x)^m \, dx\), which are beta functions:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{n+2} (1-x)^m \, dx = \frac{(n+2)! \, m!}{(n+m+3)!}
\]
However, summing the resulting double series analytically is highly non-trivial, and no closed-form expression is known for this specific integral.

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation
To approximate the integral numerically, we use adaptive quadrature. The integrand \(x^2 \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{x}) \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{1-x})\) is smooth over \([0,1]\), and numerical methods (e.g., Gaussian quadrature) yield a precise approximation. After evaluating the integral numerically, we find:

### Result
The exact answer is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but the numerical approximation is:
