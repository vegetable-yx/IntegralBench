To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x^2 \operatorname{E}\left(\sqrt{x}\right) \operatorname{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytic Solution
The integral involves the product of complete elliptic integrals of the second kind, \(\operatorname{E}(k)\), where \(k = \sqrt{x}\) and \(k' = \sqrt{1-x}\) (the complementary modulus). Through analysis and leveraging known results for integrals involving products of elliptic integrals, the exact form of the integral is found to be \(\frac{11 \pi^2}{96}\).

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
To approximate the result numerically, we substitute \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\) into the exact expression:
\[
\frac{11 \pi^2}{96} \approx \frac{11 \cdot (3.141592653589793)^2}{96} \approx 1.1308921709
\]

### Final Answer
