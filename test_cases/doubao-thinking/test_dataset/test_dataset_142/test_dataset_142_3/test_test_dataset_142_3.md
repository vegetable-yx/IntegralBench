To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:


### Step 1: Series Expansion of \(I_0(2x)\)
The modified Bessel function \(I_0(z)\) has the series representation:
\[
I_0(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(z^2/4)^n}{(n!)^2}
\]
For \(z = 2x\), this becomes:
\[
I_0(2x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}
\]


### Step 2: Interchange Sum and Integral
Substitute the series into the integral:
\[
\int_0^1 \arccos x \, I_0(2x) \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n!)^2} \int_0^1 x^{2n} \arccos x \, dx
\]


### Step 3: Evaluate the Inner Integral
Consider the inner integral \( \int_0^1 x^{2n} \arccos x \, dx \). Using integration by parts with \(u = \arccos x\) and \(dv = x^{2n} dx\), we find:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{2n} \arccos x \, dx = \frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \cdot \frac{4^n (n!)^2}{(2n)!}
\]


### Step 4: Simplify the Series
Substituting this result back into the original sum, the series simplifies to:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4^n}{(2n+1)^2 (2n)!}
\]


### Step 5: Recognize the Sum as a Hyperbolic Sine Integral
The series can be re-expressed using double integration and recognized as related to the hyperbolic sine integral \(\text{Shi}(z)\), defined as:
\[
\text{Shi}(z) = \int_0^z \frac{\sinh t}{t} \, dt
\]
The sum simplifies to \(\frac{1}{2} \text{Shi}(2)\).


### Step 6: Numerical Approximation
The hyperbolic sine integral \(\text{Shi}(2)\) is approximately \(2.5015662448\). Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{Shi}(2) \approx 1.2507831224
\]


### Final Answer
The exact value is \(\frac{1}{2} \text{Shi}(2)\), and the numerical approximation is \(1.2507831224\).
