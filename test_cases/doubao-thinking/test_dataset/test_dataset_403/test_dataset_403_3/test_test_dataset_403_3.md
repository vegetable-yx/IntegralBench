To calculate the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand
First, note that \(\log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log(x)\). Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
\log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = (-\log(x))^7 = -(\log(x))^7
\]
However, we will use a substitution to simplify the integral directly.

### Step 2: Substitution
Let \(t = \log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log(x)\). Then:
- When \(x = 0\), \(t \to \infty\) (since \(\log(x) \to -\infty\)).
- When \(x = 1\), \(t = 0\) (since \(\log(1) = 0\)).

Differentiating \(t = -\log(x)\) with respect to \(x\) gives:
\[
\frac{dt}{dx} = -\frac{1}{x} \implies dx = -x \, dt = -e^{-t} \, dt
\]
(where \(x = e^{-t}\) from \(t = -\log(x)\)).

### Step 3: Rewrite the integral
Substituting \(t = \log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) and \(dx = -e^{-t} \, dt\) into the integral, the limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) to \(t = \infty\) to \(t = 0\). Flipping the limits (which introduces a sign change) and simplifying, we get:
\[
\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx = \int_{\infty}^0 t^7 \cdot (-e^{-t}) \, dt = \int_0^\infty t^7 e^{-t} \, dt
\]

### Step 4: Recognize the Gamma function
The integral \(\int_0^\infty t^7 e^{-t} \, dt\) is the definition of the Gamma function \(\Gamma(n)\), where \(\Gamma(n) = \int_0^\infty t^{n-1} e^{-t} \, dt\). Here, \(n - 1 = 7\), so \(n = 8\). For positive integers \(n\), \(\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\). Thus:
\[
\Gamma(8) = 7! = 5040
\]

### Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact value is \(5040\), which is an integer. Its numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is \(5040.0000000000\).
