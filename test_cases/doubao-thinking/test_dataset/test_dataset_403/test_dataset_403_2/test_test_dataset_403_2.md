To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand
First, note that \(\log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log(x)\). Thus, the integrand becomes:
\[
\log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \left(-\log(x)\right)^7 = -(\log(x))^7
\]
The integral then simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx = \int_0^1 -(\log(x))^7 \, dx = -\int_0^1 (\log(x))^7 \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate \(\int_0^1 (\log(x))^n \, dx\) for \(n = 7\)
To compute \(\int_0^1 (\log(x))^7 \, dx\), we use the substitution \(t = -\log(x)\). This implies \(x = e^{-t}\) and \(dx = -e^{-t} \, dt\). When \(x = 0\), \(t \to \infty\); when \(x = 1\), \(t = 0\). The integral transforms as:
\[
\int_0^1 (\log(x))^7 \, dx = \int_{\infty}^0 (-t)^7 (-e^{-t}) \, dt
\]
Reversing the limits of integration and simplifying the signs:
\[
\int_{\infty}^0 (-t)^7 (-e^{-t}) \, dt = \int_0^\infty t^7 e^{-t} \, dt
\]
The integral \(\int_0^\infty t^7 e^{-t} \, dt\) is the Gamma function \(\Gamma(8)\), which for integer \(n\) satisfies \(\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\). Here, \(\Gamma(8) = 7!\). Thus:
\[
\int_0^1 (\log(x))^7 \, dx = 7!
\]

### Step 3: Combine results
Recall the original integral:
\[
-\int_0^1 (\log(x))^7 \, dx = -7!
\]
However, substituting back the simplification of the integrand, we have:
\[
\int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx = -(-7!) = 7!
\]

### Step 4: Numerical approximation
Since \(7! = 5040\), the numerical approximation is exactly \(5040\).

### Final Answer
The exact value of the integral is \(7!\) (which equals \(5040\)), and its numerical approximation is \(5040.0000000000\).
