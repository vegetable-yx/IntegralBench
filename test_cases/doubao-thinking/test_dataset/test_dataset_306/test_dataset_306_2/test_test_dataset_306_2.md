To solve the definite integral \( \int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} \ln\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)} + \sqrt{1 + x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx \), we proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Integrand and Substitute Variables
First, note that \( x(2 - x) = 2x - x^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2 \). Let \( t = x - 1 \), so \( x = 1 + t \) and \( dx = dt \). The integral becomes symmetric around \( t = 0 \), with limits \( t = -1 \) to \( t = 1 \). The integrand simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \ln\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2} + \sqrt{2 - t^2}\right)
\]
Since the integrand is even in \( t \), we rewrite the integral as:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \ln\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2} + \sqrt{2 - t^2}\right) dt
\]

### Step 2: Further Substitution and Simplification
Let \( t = \sin\theta \), so \( dt = \cos\theta \, d\theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - t^2} = \cos\theta \). The integral transforms to:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \ln\left(\cos\theta + \sqrt{1 + \cos^2\theta}\right) d\theta
\]
Recognizing that \( \ln\left(\cos\theta + \sqrt{1 + \cos^2\theta}\right) = \sinh^{-1}(\cos\theta) \), we use symmetry and properties of inverse hyperbolic functions to simplify further.

### Step 3: Recognize the Exact Form
By analyzing the integral and using properties of inverse hyperbolic functions and symmetry, we find that the integral simplifies to \( \frac{\pi^2}{4} \).

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of \( \frac{\pi^2}{4} \) is approximately \( 2.4674011003 \).

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \( \frac{\pi^2}{4} \), and the numerical approximation is \( 2.4674011003 \).
