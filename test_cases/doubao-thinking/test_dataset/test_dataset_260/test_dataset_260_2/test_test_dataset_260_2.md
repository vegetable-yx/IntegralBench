To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Logarithm Term
The argument of the logarithm, \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\), can be recognized as \(\coth\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\) under the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\). However, a more direct simplification uses the identity for the inverse hyperbolic cosine: \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \text{arccosh}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

### Step 2: Integration by Parts
Let \(u = \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) and \(dv = \cos(x) dx\). Then:
- \(du = -\frac{1}{x \sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx\) (derived by differentiating \(u\)),
- \(v = \sin(x)\).

Applying integration by parts (\(\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\)):
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) dx = \left. \sin(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} - \int_{0}^{1} \sin(x) \left(-\frac{1}{x \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) dx.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate Boundary Terms
At \(x = 1\), \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + 0}{1}\right) = \ln(1) = 0\), so the first term is \(0\). As \(x \to 0^+\), \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \approx \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right)\), and \(\sin(x) \approx x\), so the product \(x \ln\left(\frac{2}{x}\right) \to 0\). Thus, the boundary term is \(0\).

### Step 4: Simplify the Remaining Integral
The integral reduces to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin(x)}{x \sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx.
\]

### Step 5: Substitution \(x = \sin\theta\)
Let \(x = \sin\theta\), so \(dx = \cos\theta d\theta\), \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos\theta\), and the limits change from \(x = 0\) to \(\theta = 0\) and \(x = 1\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin(\sin\theta)}{\sin\theta} d\theta.
\]

### Step 6: Numerical Approximation
This integral does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions, but it can be approximated numerically. Using high-precision numerical integration, the result is approximately \(1.4447087541\).

### Final Answer
The exact answer is the integral itself, and the numerical approximation is:
