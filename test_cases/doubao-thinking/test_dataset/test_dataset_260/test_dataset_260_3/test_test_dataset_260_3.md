To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Logarithm Term
First, simplify the argument of the logarithm: \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\). Using the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\) (so \(dx = \cos\theta \, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos\theta\)), the argument becomes \(\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\). Thus, the logarithm term simplifies to \(\ln\left(\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)\).

### Step 2: Integration by Parts
Let \(u = \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\). Then \(du = -\frac{1}{x\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx\) (derived by differentiating the logarithm) and \(v = \sin(x)\). Applying integration by parts:
\[
\int u \, dv = uv \bigg|_{0}^{1} - \int v \, du
\]
The boundary term \(uv \bigg|_{0}^{1}\) vanishes because \(u(1) = 0\) and \(\lim_{x \to 0^+} u(x) \cdot \sin(x) = 0\). Thus, the integral reduces to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin(x)}{x\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx
\]

### Step 3: Substitution and Series Expansion
Using \(x = \sin t\) (so \(dx = \cos t \, dt\) and \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos t\)), the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin(\sin t)}{\sin t} dt
\]
Expanding \(\sin(\sin t)\) as a Taylor series:
\[
\sin(\sin t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (\sin t)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\]
Dividing by \(\sin t\) and integrating term-by-term, we use the Wallis integral formula for \(\int_{0}^{\pi/2} (\sin t)^{2n} dt\). This leads to a series involving Bessel functions, ultimately simplifying to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \int_{0}^{1} J_0(z) \, dz
\]
where \(J_0(z)\) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 0.

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
The integral \(\int_{0}^{1} J_0(z) \, dz \approx 0.92033338\). Thus, the original integral is approximately:
\[
\frac{\pi}{2} \times 0.92033338 \approx 1.4447074807
\]

### Final Answer
The exact answer is \(\frac{\pi}{2} \int_{0}^{1} J_0(z) \, dz\), and the numerical approximation is \(1.4447074807\).
