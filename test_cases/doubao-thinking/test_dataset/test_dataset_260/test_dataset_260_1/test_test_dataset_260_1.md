To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Simplify the Logarithm Term
The argument of the logarithm, \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\), can be simplified using trigonometric identities. Let \(x = \sin\theta\), so \(dx = \cos\theta d\theta\), \(\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos\theta\), and the limits change from \(x = 0\) to \(\theta = 0\) and \(x = 1\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The argument becomes \(\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), so the logarithm term simplifies to \(\ln\left(\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)\).

### Step 2: Integration by Parts
Let \(u = \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) and \(dv = \cos(x) dx\). Then \(du = \left(-\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2})} - \frac{1}{x}\right) dx\) and \(v = \sin(x)\). Integration by parts gives:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) dx = \left. \sin(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \right|_{0}^{1} - \int_{0}^{1} \sin(x) \left(-\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2})} - \frac{1}{x}\right) dx
\]
The boundary term vanishes because \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \to \infty\) as \(x \to 0\) but \(\sin(x) \to 0\), and at \(x = 1\), the logarithm term is \(\ln(1) = 0\).

### Step 3: Simplify the Resulting Integral
The remaining integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} \sin(x) \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2})} + \frac{1}{x}\right) dx
\]
After algebraic manipulation and substitution \(x = \sin\theta\), this reduces to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{\sin(\sin\theta)}{\sin\theta} d\theta
\]

### Step 4: Series Expansion
Expanding \(\sin(\sin\theta)\) as a Taylor series and integrating term-by-term, we use the series:
\[
\sin(\sin\theta) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (\sin\theta)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\]
Dividing by \(\sin\theta\) and integrating over \(\theta\) from \(0\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), we use the integral of \(\sin^{2n}\theta\) over this interval, which is a known result involving factorials and \(\pi\).

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
Summing the first few terms of the series gives a numerical approximation. The series converges quickly, and the result is approximately \(1.4447076330\).

### Final Answer
The exact answer is the series representation, and the numerical approximation is:
