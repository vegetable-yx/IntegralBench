Let’s solve the integral:
\[
\int_0^3 (x^2+1)\, d\lfloor x\rfloor
\]

### Step 1: Understand the Integrator

The function \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) is a step function that jumps by 1 at integer values of \(x\). Thus, \(d\lfloor x\rfloor\) is a sum of Dirac delta spikes at integer \(x\). For a function \(f(x)\):
\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, d\lfloor x\rfloor = \sum_{k=\lceil a\rceil}^{\lfloor b\rfloor} f(k)
\]
If \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, sometimes the left endpoint is not included, sometimes it is. The distributional derivative of \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) is the sum of Dirac deltas at the integers. For \(x \in [0,3]\), the jumps occur at \(x=1,2,3\).

Let’s analyze what values are picked up:
- At \(x=0\): No jump (since \(\lfloor 0\rfloor\) is already at 0).
- At \(x=1\): Jump of 1.
- At \(x=2\): Jump of 1.
- At \(x=3\): Jump of 1, but at upper limit, which may or may not be included depending on the convention.

The Stieltjes integral with respect to a function with jumps, from \(a\) to \(b\), includes the jumps at \(a < x_j \leq b\).
So for \(0 \leq x \leq 3\), the jumps in \(\lfloor x\rfloor\) occur at \(x=1, 2, 3\).

### Step 2: Evaluate the Stieltjes Integral

The value is the sum at the points of discontinuity, i.e. at \(x=1,2,3\) the jump is \(1\):
\[
\int_0^3 f(x) \, d\lfloor x\rfloor = \sum_{k=1}^3 f(k)
\]
where \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\).

So,
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{3} (k^2 + 1) = (1^2 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (3^2 + 1) = (1+1) + (4+1) + (9+1) = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

The exact value is \(17\), so the numerical approximation to 10 decimals is:
\[
17.0000000000
\]
