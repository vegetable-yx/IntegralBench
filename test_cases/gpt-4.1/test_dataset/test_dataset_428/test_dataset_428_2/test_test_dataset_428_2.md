Let's proceed step by step.

## 1. Understanding the Integral

\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor
\]

This is a **Stieltjes integral** with respect to the floor function. Since \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) increases by 1 at integer points, the integral evaluates to a sum over the jumps of \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) at the points \(x=1,2,3\). However, since the upper limit is 3 (not exceeding 3), the only jumps within \([0, 3]\) are at \(x=1,2,3\), but for the Stieltjes integral, we consider the left-hand limits.

For any function \(f\), we have:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = \sum_{k=\lceil a \rceil}^{\lfloor b \rfloor} f(k)
\]

- The jumps occur at the integers \(x = 1, 2, 3\).
- At each jump \(k\), the jump is 1, and the value of \(f(x)\) at the jump is \(f(k)\), given \(f\) is right-continuous at that point.

But more formally, because the increment at integer \(k\) is 1 (\(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps by 1 there), the value contributed by \(x^2+1\) at that jump is the **left-hand limit** at \(x = k\), i.e., \(f(k^-)\).

The standard convention for Stieltjes integrals with respect to functions like the floor function is:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = \sum_{k=\lceil a \rceil}^{\lfloor b \rfloor} f(k^-)
\]

For \(a = 0\), \(b = 3\):

\[
\int_0^3 (x^2+1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = \sum_{k=1}^3 f(k^-)
\]

Now, \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\), so \(f(k^-) = \lim_{x \to k^-} (x^2+1) = (k^-)^2 + 1\).

But since \(x \to k^-\), \(x\) approaches \(k\) from below (but is not equal to \(k\)). But for a polynomial (continuous) function, the left limit and the value at the point coincide, so \(f(k^-) = k^2 + 1\).

Wait, this is slightly subtle. For the Stieltjes integral of a continuous function \(f\) with respect to the floor function, the contributions at jumps \(k\) is \(f(k^-)\), but as \(f\) is continuous, \(f(k^-)=f(k)\).

But more precisely: the general formula for the Stieltjes integral with respect to a function of bounded variation \(g(x)\) over \([a, b]\) is:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dg(x) = \sum_{\substack{x_i \text{ is a point of discontinuity}\\a < x_i \leq b}} (g(x_i^+) - g(x_i^-)) f(x_i)
\]

But for the floor function, at \(x=k\) the jump is \(1\), so \(g(x^+)-g(x^-)=1\) at integer \(k\), and zero elsewhere.

So the contribution at each integer \(k \in (a, b]\) is \(f(k) \cdot 1\), or just \(f(k)\).

Therefore:
\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1)\ d\lfloor x \rfloor = f(1) + f(2) + f(3)
\]
because the jumps are at \(x=1,2,3\) and only for \(0 < x \leq 3\) (so we do not include \(x=0\)).

Letâ€™s be careful:

- At \(x=1\): The jump happens at \(x=1\).
- At \(x=2\): The jump happens at \(x=2\).
- At \(x=3\): The jump happens at \(x=3\).
- Are we including the upper endpoint? In the standard definition, jumps at the upper endpoint \(b\) are **included**.

So,

\[
\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1)\ d\lfloor x \rfloor = f(1) + f(2) + f(3)
\]

## 2. Calculate the result

Calculate \(f(k) = k^2 + 1\):

- For \(k=1\): \(1^2+1=2\)
- For \(k=2\): \(2^2+1=5\)
- For \(k=3\): \(3^2+1=10\)

Sum:

\[
2 + 5 + 10 = 17
\]
