Let’s tackle the definite integral:
\[
I = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\, dx
\]

**Step 1: Seek symmetry or simplification**

Notice that the function inside the integral is \(\tan(\cos(x))\), and since \(\cos(x)\) is even:
\[
\cos(2\pi - x) = \cos(x)
\]
Therefore,
\[
\tan(\cos(2\pi - x)) = \tan(\cos(x))
\]

This makes \(\tan(\cos(x))\) a symmetric (even) function over \([0, 2\pi]\).

Let’s also check:
Let’s consider what happens if we substitute \(u = x + \pi\). Then \(dx = du\), and as \(x\) goes from \(0\) to \(2\pi\), \(u\) goes from \(\pi\) to \(3\pi\), but because \(\cos(u)\) has period \(2\pi\), this is effectively the same as integrating over an interval of length \(2\pi\).

But perhaps more illuminating is to look at partial-period symmetries.

**Step 2: Consider the behavior over \([0, \pi]\) and \([\pi, 2\pi]\)**

Let’s use the substitution \(u = 2\pi - x\):

When \(x\) goes from 0 to \(2\pi\), \(u\) goes from \(2\pi\) to 0, so \(du = -dx\).

Substitute in the integral:
\[
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x))\, dx = \int_{2\pi}^{0} \tan(\cos(2\pi - u))(-du) = \int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(2\pi - u)) du
\]
But as before,
\[
\cos(2\pi - u) = \cos(u) \implies \tan(\cos(2\pi - u)) = \tan(\cos(u))
\]
Thus,
\[
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(u))\, du = I
\]
This gives no new information.

Let’s instead consider integrating over half the period, since \(\cos(x)\) is symmetric over \([0, 2\pi]\).

Now, consider the substitution \(x = \pi - t\), \(dx = -dt\), as \(x\) goes from 0 to \(\pi\), \(t\) goes from \(\pi\) to 0.

So,
\[
I_1 = \int_0^{\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) dx
    = \int_\pi^0 \tan(\cos(\pi - t))(-dt)
    = \int_0^\pi \tan(\cos(\pi - t))dt
\]
But
\[
\cos(\pi - t) = -\cos t \implies \tan(\cos(\pi - t)) = \tan(-\cos t) = -\tan(\cos t)
\]
Thus,
\[
I_1 = \int_0^\pi -\tan(\cos t)dt = -I_1 \implies I_1 = 0
\]

Thus, the integral over half the period is zero. The same argument holds for \([\pi, 2\pi]\).

Therefore,
\[
I = I_1 + I_2 = 0 + 0 = 0
\]

**Step 3: Numerical approximation**

Let’s confirm numerically:
\[
I \approx \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) dx
\]
Let’s compute this using, e.g., a numerical integration (Gaussian quadrature, Simpson’s rule, etc.).

However, since the function is odd over half the period, the integral is zero analytically, so the numerical value (to 10 decimal places) is:
\[
0.0000000000
\]
