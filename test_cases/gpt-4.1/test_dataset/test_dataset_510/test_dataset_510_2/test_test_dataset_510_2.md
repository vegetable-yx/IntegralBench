Let's evaluate the integral:
\[
I = \int_0^{5\pi/2} \frac{dx}{2+\cos x}
\]

### Step 1: Analytically Evaluate the Integral

First, recall a standard result:
\[
\int_0^{a} \frac{dx}{A + B\cos x} \quad (A > |B|)
\]

In this case, \( A = 2 \), \( B = 1 \), \( A > |B| \). The indefinite integral is:
\[
\int \frac{dx}{a + b\cos x} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \arctan\left( \frac{(a-b)\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} \right) + C
\]

Apply for \( a=2, b=1 \):
\[
\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{4 - 1} = \sqrt{3}
\]

So,
\[
\int \frac{dx}{2+\cos x} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{(2-1)\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \right) + C
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \right) + C
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral

Let’s compute the value from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 5\pi/2 \):

\[
I = \left. \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \right|_0^{5\pi/2}
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \left[ \arctan\left( \frac{\tan\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)}{\sqrt{3}} \right) - \arctan\left( \frac{\tan(0)}{\sqrt{3}} \right) \right]
\]

Calculate the terms:

- \(\tan(0) = 0\), so \(\arctan(0) = 0\)
- \(\frac{5\pi}{4} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{4}\), so \(\tan\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right) = \tan\left(\pi + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1\) (since period of \(\tan\) is \(\pi\))

So,

\[
I = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \left[ \arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) - 0 \right] = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

But we must carefully consider the limits, because the upper bound is \(x = 5\pi/2\). Let's check \(\tan(5\pi/4)\):

- \(\tan(5\pi/4) = \tan(\pi + \pi/4) = \tan(\pi/4) = 1\)

But let's check the steps carefully.

Alternatively, let's check the substitution for \(\tan\left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)\):
- \(\frac{5\pi}{4} = 225^\circ\)
- \(\tan(225^\circ) = \tan(45^\circ) = 1\), since tangent has a period of \(\pi\).

Now, for \(x = 5\pi/2\):

\(\frac{5\pi}{2} = 2\pi + \pi/2\), so

\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{5\pi/2}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{4}
\]
So as above, \(\tan(\frac{5\pi}{4}) = 1\)

Thus, the calculation above is correct.

Therefore,
\[
I = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
\]

But recall, the range is from \(0\) to \(5\pi/2\), which is \(2.5\) periods. The period of the integrand is \(2\pi\) (since cosines are \(2\pi\)-periodic).

Alternatively, let's check the indefinite integral, but more generally, let's see if over each period the result repeats.

But the formula and the calculation for this range is correct.

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

Calculate \(\arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\):

\[
\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205080756888
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.57735026918963
\]
\[
\arctan(0.57735026918963) = \frac{\pi}{6} \approx 0.523598775598299
\]

So,
\[
I = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}
\]

Thus, the exact expression simplifies to \(\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}\).

But, is this correct for the full interval? Let's check for an interval of length \(2\pi\):

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{dx}{2+\cos x} = ?
\]

Plug into the formula:

- at \(x=2\pi\): \(\frac{x}{2} = \pi\), \(\tan(\pi) = 0\), \(\arctan(0) = 0\)
- at \(x=0\): \(\arctan(0) = 0\)

Difference is zero. Clearly, over one period the net area is zero. But this seems strange.

Wait: let's actually recalculate the definite value over \(x=0\) to \(x=2\pi\):

At \(x = 2\pi\), \(x/2 = \pi\), \(\tan(\pi) = 0\), \(\arctan(0) = 0\);
At \(x = 0\), same value.

So the integral over a period is zero: this is not possible, since the integrand is always positive.

It must be there's a misinterpretation of the indefinite integral formula or the branch of arctangent.

Actually, let's notice that the definite integral over an interval larger than \(2\pi\) must be obtained by considering the periodicity and the possible jump in arctangent values.

The indefinite integral is:
\[
F(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \right)
\]

Let’s check values carefully:

At \( x = 0: \tan(0) = 0 \implies \arctan(0) = 0 \)

At \( x = 2\pi: \frac{x}{2} = \pi \implies \tan \pi = 0 \implies \arctan(0) = 0 \)

But as \(x\) passes \(x = \pi\), \(\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) goes from positive infinity to negative infinity, so arctan jumps by \(\pi\).

Let's try intermediate points:

At \( x = \pi \), \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( \tan(\frac{\pi}{2}) \to \infty \), so \(\arctan\left( \infty \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

So, as \(x\) increases:
- From \(0\) to \(\pi\), \( \frac{x}{2} \) goes from \(0\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)
- At \( x = \pi \), \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), \(\tan(\frac{\pi}{2}) \to \infty \), so arctan of that goes to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)
- From \(x=\pi\) to \(x=2\pi\), \( \frac{x}{2} \) goes from \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\pi\), so \(\tan(\frac{x}{2})\) goes from \(\infty\) (jump down) through zero at \(\pi\).

But the arctan function's range is \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(+\frac{\pi}{2}\), so as the argument crosses infinity, arctan jumps.

Thus, between \(0\) and \(2\pi\), there is a net increase in arctan value:

At \(x = 0: \tan(0) = 0 \implies \arctan(0) = 0\)

At \(x \to \pi^{-}: \tan(\frac{\pi}{2}^-) \to +\infty \implies \arctan(+\infty) = +\frac{\pi}{2}\)

At \(x \to \pi^{+}: \tan(\frac{\pi}{2}^+) \to -\infty \implies \arctan(-\infty) = -\frac{\pi}{2}\)

At \(x = 2\pi: \tan(\pi) = 0 \implies \arctan(0) = 0\)

So, if we follow the principal branch, as x goes from 0 to π, arctan increases from 0 to +π/2, but between π and 2π, it goes from -π/2 to 0. Thus, the net change is

\(
(\text{from } 0 \text{ to } \frac{\pi}{2}) + (\text{from } -\frac{\pi}{2} \text{ to } 0) = (\frac{\pi}{2} - 0) + (0 - (-\frac{\pi}{2})) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi
\)

So over a range of \(0\) to \(2\pi\), the arctangent increases by \(\pi\).

Therefore,
\[
I = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \pi \quad \text{over } x \text{ from } 0 \text{ to } 2\pi
\]

More generally, over an interval of length \(L\), let’s define \(n\) as the number of full oscillations:

From the above, over each period \(2\pi\), the integral is \( \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Now, \( \left[0, \frac{5\pi}{2}\right] \) is \(2.5\) periods.

So, number of oscillations \( = \frac{5\pi/2}{2\pi} = \frac{5}{4} \).

Wait, that's not correct. Let's consider the total length: Is the net change in arctan properly computed? Let's directly substitute the endpoints and sum possible jumps.

Let’s define:
\[
F(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan\left( \frac{\tan\frac{x}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} \right )
\]

Compute at \( x=0 \):
- \( \tan(0) = 0 \)
- \( \arctan(0) = 0 \)

At \( x = 5\pi/2 \):

\( \frac{5\pi}{2}/2 = \frac{5\pi}{4} \)

\( \tan(\frac{5\pi}{4}) = \tan(\pi + \frac{\pi}{4}) = \tan(\pi/4) = 1 \) (since period of tangent is \(\pi\))

So,

\( F(5\pi/2) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \arctan(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} ) \)

But the principal value gives \( \arctan(1/\sqrt{3}) = \pi/6 \).

However, as $x$ passes through $x = \pi$, the arctangent jumps by $-\pi$. Let's examine the continuity of the integral over $x=0$ to $x=5\pi/2$ carefully.

Let's recall that for some $x_0$, $\arctan(z)$ has a branch cut, so we must account for the correct value, increasing by $\pi$ each time $\frac{x}{2}$ increases by $\pi$.

- From $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, $\frac{x}{2}$ increases from 0 to $\pi$; tangent has a period of $\pi$.
- As $\tan(\frac{x}{2})$ crosses its poles, the arctan function's value jumps.

It is best to approach this integral by breaking the interval into intervals of length $2\pi$:

- $[0, 2\pi]$, length $2\pi$
- $[2\pi, 5\pi/2]$, length $\pi/2$

Let’s compute the integral over each segment.

#### Integral over $[0, 2\pi]$:

On this interval, as shown above, the antiderivative increases by $2\pi/\sqrt{3}$.

#### Integral over $[2\pi, 5\pi/2]$:

Compute $F(5\pi/2) - F(2\pi)$

- At $x = 2\pi: \frac{x}{2} = \pi$, so $\tan(\pi) = 0$, so $\arctan(0) = 0$
- At $x = 5\pi/2: \frac{x}{2} = 5\pi/4$, $\tan(5\pi/4) = 1$, $\arctan(1/\sqrt{3}) = \pi/6$

Therefore,

\[
I = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\left( \frac{\pi}{6} - 0 \right) = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\pi + \frac{\pi}{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{(6\pi + \pi)}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{7\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}
\]

So, the exact answer is \( \boxed{ \frac{7\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} } \).

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation

\pi \approx 3.1415926536

\[
\sqrt{3} \approx 1.7320508076
\]
\[
3\sqrt{3} \approx 5.196152423
\]
\[
\frac{7\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} = \frac{7 \times 3.1415926536}{5.196152423}
\]
\[
7 \times 3.1415926536 = 21.991148576
\]
\[
\frac{21.991148576}{5.196152423} \approx 4.2328439582
\]
