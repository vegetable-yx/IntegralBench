Let's follow the steps:

**Step 1. Analytically compute the integral**

We are to compute:
\[
I = \int_0^1 \log^7\left(\frac 1 x\right)\, dx
\]

Recall that \(\log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log x\), so:
\[
I = \int_0^1 \left(-\log x\right)^7 dx = (-1)^7 \int_0^1 \log^7 x\, dx = -\int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx
\]

Now, we need the general formula for \(\int_0^1 \log^k x\, dx\):

\[
\int_0^1 \log^k x \, dx = (-1)^k k!
\]
*(This is a well-known result that can be proved by induction or recognized as a particular value of the gamma function: \(\int_0^1 x^{a-1} dx = \frac{1}{a}\), differentiate both sides \(k\) times with respect to \(a\).)*

But let's check for \(k=7\):

\[
\int_0^1 \log^7 x \, dx = (-1)^7 \cdot 7! = -5040
\]

Therefore,
\[
I = -(-5040) = 5040
\]

**Step 2. Steps Employed**

- Recognize that \(\log^7 \left(\frac 1 x\right) = (-\log x)^7\).
- Use the formula for \(\int_0^1 \log^k x \, dx = (-1)^k k!\) for integer \(k\geq 0\).
- For \(k=7\), compute \(7! = 5040\).
- The minus sign from the original expression cancels the negative value.

**Step 3. Numerical approximation**

Now, \(5040\) is already an integer, so its decimal representation rounded to 10 decimal places is:
\[
5040.0000000000
\]

**Step 4. JSON output**
