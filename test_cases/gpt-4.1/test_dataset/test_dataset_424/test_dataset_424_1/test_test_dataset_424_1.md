Let's follow the steps:

### 1. Compute the integral analytically

We are asked to compute:
\[
I = \int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1} \, dx
\]

#### Symmetry analysis

Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} \). Let's check its parity:
- \(\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\)
- \((-x)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1\)

Thus,
\[
f(-x) = \frac{\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} = -f(x)
\]
So \( f(x) \) is an **odd function**.

It is a property of integration that the definite integral of an odd function over an interval symmetric about the origin is zero:
\[
\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0 \quad \text{if } f(x) \text{ is odd}
\]
provided the function is defined and integrableâ€”which it is for our function.

### 2. Steps to reach the solution

- \( f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1} \) is odd.
- The interval \( [-2023, 2023] \) is symmetric about 0.
- The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero.

### 3. Numerical Approximation

The answer is exactly 0, so the numerical approximation is:
\[
0.0000000000
\]
