Let 
\[
I = \int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1} \, dx.
\]

**Step 1: Analyze the symmetry**

Notice that \(\sin(x)\) is an odd function and \(x^2 + 1\) is an even function. Therefore,
\[
f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}
\]
is **odd** as well.

Recall that for any odd function \(f(x)\) and symmetric interval \([-a, a]\),
\[
\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\,dx = 0.
\]

**Step 2: Apply the result**

Here, since \(f(x)\) is odd and the interval is symmetric about 0, we have:
\[
I = 0
\]

**Step 3: Numerical approximation**

The analytical value is exactly 0, so the numerical approximation is also 0.0000000000.
