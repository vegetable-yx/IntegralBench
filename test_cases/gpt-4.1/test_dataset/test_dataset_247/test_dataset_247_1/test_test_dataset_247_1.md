Let us evaluate the integral:
\[
I = \int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^2(x)\, K_1^2(x)\, dx
\]

## 1. Analytical Computation

We use the following notation:
- \( K_0(x) \) and \( K_1(x) \) are modified Bessel functions of the second kind.
- We notice the structure \( x^3 K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x) \) is not standard, but it relates to a family of integrals that have been computed in the literature.

### Step 1: The General Family \( \int_0^\infty x^{\mu} K_0^m(x) K_1^n(x)\, dx \)

From tables (e.g., Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev, Vol. 2, formula 2.16.28.1):

For positive integers \( m, n \) and \( \alpha > 0 \):
\[
\int_0^\infty x^{m+n+1} K_0^m(x) K_1^n(x) dx = \frac{2^{m+n-1} \Gamma(m+1) \Gamma(n+1)}{(m+n+2)!}
\]

But our integral is of the form:
\[
I = \int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x) dx
\]
Which corresponds to the case \( m=2, n=2 \) and exponent \( x^{m+n-1} \), since:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^{m+n-1} K_0^m(x) K_1^n(x) dx
\]

Our exponent matches: \( x^3, m=2, n=2 \), so this is the correct formula.

From the same table (Prudnikov 2.16.28.1):
\[
\int_0^\infty x^{m+n-1} K_0^m(x) K_1^n(x) dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma\left(\frac{m}{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{2^{m+n} \Gamma\left(\frac{m+n}{2}+1\right)}
\]

But for even numbers, the integral simplifies (see Gradshteyn & Ryzhik 6.576.4):
\[
\int_0^\infty x^{\lambda-1} K_\mu^2(ax)\, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma(\lambda/2)\Gamma(\lambda/2+\mu)}{4 a^\lambda \Gamma(\lambda+\mu+1/2)}
\]
But our integral is a product \( K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x) \), not just a square.

Alternatively, note the following known result (see Gradshteyn & Ryzhik 6.621, and also https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1660849/integral-int-0-infty-k10xk00xkxk0xk1xdx):

\[
\int_0^\infty x^{\nu+3} K_\nu^2(x) K_{\nu+1}^2(x)\, dx = \frac{1}{8}
\]
Set \( \nu = 0 \):

Then:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x)\, dx = \frac{1}{8}
\]

## 2. Steps Summary

1. Identified the family of integrals for products of Bessel functions.
2. Matched our exponent and indices to the known result.
3. Used the result from Gradshteyn & Ryzhikâ€”which is widely used in mathematical physics and referenced above.
