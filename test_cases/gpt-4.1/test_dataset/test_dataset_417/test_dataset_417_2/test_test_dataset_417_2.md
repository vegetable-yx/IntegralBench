Let's compute the definite integral:
\[
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x)\, dx
\]

**Step 1: Analytic Computation**

Let us perform a substitution. Let \( u = x \), so \( du = dx \).

Let us look for possible symmetries. Consider the substitution \( x \mapsto 2\pi - x \):

\[
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(x) - x) dx
\stackrel{x'=2\pi-x}{=} \int_{x'=2\pi}^{x'=0} \sin(\sin(2\pi-x') - (2\pi-x')) (-dx')
\]
\[
= \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(\sin(2\pi-x') - (2\pi-x')) dx'
\]
But \(\sin(2\pi-x') = -\sin(x')\).
So,
\[
\sin(\sin(2\pi-x') - (2\pi-x')) = \sin(-\sin(x') - (2\pi-x'))
\]

Now, use the sine difference formula:
\[
\sin(-A-B) = -\sin(A+B)
\]
So,
\[
\sin(-\sin(x') - (2\pi-x')) = -\sin(\sin(x') + (2\pi-x'))
\]

But since \(\sin\) is \(2\pi\)-periodic, \(\sin(y+2\pi) = \sin(y)\), thus,
\[
\sin(\sin(x') + (2\pi-x')) = \sin(\sin(x')-x')
\]
So,
\[
\sin(-\sin(x') - (2\pi-x')) = -\sin(\sin(x')-x')
\]

Thus,
\[
I = \int_0^{2\pi} -\sin(\sin(x)-x)\, dx = -I
\]
So, \(I = -I \implies I = 0\).

**Step 2: Steps Recap**

- Made the substitution \( x \mapsto 2\pi - x \) in the definite integral.
- Used sine's symmetry and periodicity to show that the value of the integral is negated by the substitution.
- Therefore, the integral is zero.

**Step 3: Numerical Approximation**
