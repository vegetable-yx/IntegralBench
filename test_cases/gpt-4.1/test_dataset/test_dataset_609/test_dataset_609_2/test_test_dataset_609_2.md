Let's proceed step by step.

**Step 1: Understanding the integrand**

We have the integral:
\[
I = \int_0^1 \left\lfloor \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \right\rfloor \, dx
\]
The floor function takes integer values.

**Step 2: Examine the range of \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\) for \(x \in (0,1]\):**

As \(x \to 0^+\), \(\frac{\pi}{x} \to +\infty\), so \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})\) oscillates between -1 and 1 rapidly.
At \(x=1\), \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{1})=\cos(\pi) = -1\).

Let us find in which intervals \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{x})\) falls in a given integer range.

We know that \(-1 \leq \cos \theta \leq 1\), so the floor function only takes values -1 or 0 (since \(\cos \theta = 1\) only for certain isolated x).

But let us check: Where does \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) = 0\) ?

That occurs when \(\frac{\pi}{x} = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\), i.e.,
\[
\frac{\pi}{x} = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \implies x = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + k}
\]
for \(k=0,1,2,\dots\)

Thus, for generic \(x \in (0,1]\), \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\) can take values in [-1,1], but the set where it equals exactly any integer other than \(-1\) is measure zero.

Thus,
\[
\left\lfloor \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \right\rfloor =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \in [0,1) \\
-1 & \text{if } \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \in [-1,0)
\end{cases}
\]
We will be careful at exact zeros, but since this is a set of measure zero, those points contribute nothing to the integral.

**Step 3: Find intervals where floor is -1 and where it is 0**

Let us solve for x such that \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \geq 0\):

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right) \geq 0 \\
\implies \frac{\pi}{x} \in \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty [2\pi n, (2n+1)\pi]
\]
That is, whenever the angle is within an even multiple of \(\pi\) up to the next odd multiple, cosine is non-negative.

So for \(x \in (0,1]\), as \(x\) increases from 0 to 1, \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) falls from \(+\infty\) to \(\pi\).

Let's see for which x,
\[
\frac{\pi}{x} \in [2\pi n, (2n+1)\pi] \implies x \in \left[\frac{1}{2n+1}, \frac{1}{2n}\right]
\]
Where in terms of intervals for \(x\), we use reciprocal and flip the inequalities (since reciprocal reverses order for positive terms):
\[
2\pi n \leq \frac{\pi}{x} \leq (2n+1)\pi \implies \frac{1}{2n+1} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2n}
\]
But for \(x \in (0,1]\), both endpoints are in (0,1] only for \(n \geq 0\), with \(\frac{1}{2n}\) undefined for \(n=0\) (but for \(n=0\), \(\frac{1}{1}>1\)). So compute for \(n \geq 1\).

Hold on, let's check for n=0:

For \(n=0\), the range is \([0, 1]\):
\[
\frac{1}{2*0+1} = 1,\quad \frac{1}{2*0} = \infty
\]
But as \(n\to 0\), the upper bound is not in \((0,1]\).

So, summarizing, for each \(n\) where \(\frac{1}{2n} < 1\), the interval \(( \frac{1}{2n+1}, \frac{1}{2n} ]\) is the set where the cosine is nonnegative.

Similarly, in the complementary intervals, cosine is negative, and thus floor is -1.

Let us list explicitly:

- For \(x \in (\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n-1})\), \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{x}) < 0\) and thus floor = -1.
- For \(x \in (\frac{1}{2n+1}, \frac{1}{2n})\), \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{x}) \geq 0\), floor = 0.

Let's check endpoints: At endpoints, cosine is zero, so floor is -1 at those points as 0 is not included in \([0,1)\) for the (-1) interval.

But for purposes of the integral, set of endpoints are measure zero. We may safely ignore them.

**Step 4: Sum the lengths of the intervals where floor is -1**

We want:
\[
I = \int_0^1 \left\lfloor \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{x} \right)\right\rfloor dx
\]
is equal to minus the sum of the lengths of all intervals where \(\left\lfloor \cos(\pi/x) \right\rfloor = -1\), i.e., where \(\cos(\pi/x) < 0\).

Thus,
\[
I = - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
\]
Let me clarify the breakdown for the intervals. For \(n=1,2,\dots\):

- Interval: \(x \in (\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n-1})\)
- Length: \(\frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \)

As these intervals are disjoint and partitions \((0,1)\) (except for the set of measure zero endpoints and the first interval, which we'll check below):

Does the union of all intervals for all \(n \geq 1\) cover \((0,1)\) together with the intervals where floor is 0? Yes, we are fine.

So the integral is:
\[
I = - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
\]

\[
\text{Let us compute this sum:}
\]
\[
I = - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
= - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
\]
\[
= - \left( \left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} \right)
    + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right)
    + \left( \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} \right)
    + \cdots \right)
\]
\[
= - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n}
\]

But
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} + \cdots
\]

and
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \cdots
\]

But
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n}
\]
Thus,
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n}
\]
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1} = H_\infty - H_\infty^{(2)}
\]
But all such sums diverge, so we need to consider only up to the intervals that are inside the integration domain.

But since for each \(n, \frac{1}{2n-1} \geq 0\), and as \(n\) increases, \(\frac{1}{2n-1}\) decreases.

But for the interval \((\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n-1})\) to be contained in \((0,1]\), the lower bound \(\frac{1}{2n}\) is positive for all \(n\), and the upper bound \(\frac{1}{2n-1}\) is \(\leq 1\) for \(n \geq 1\).

For \(n=1, (\frac{1}{2},1]\), which is \((0.5,1]\).

So, for \(x \in (0,1]\), the union of these intervals, for \(n = 1\) to \(\infty\), cover all of \((0,1]\) except for intervals \(( \frac{1}{2n+1},\frac{1}{2n} ]\).

But the sum extends to \(n \to \infty\), but as \(n\) increases, the length goes to 0.

So the definite integral is:
\[
I = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
\]

But let's sum up to where \(\frac{1}{2n-1} > 0\), i.e., for all \(n \geq 1\).

But let's sum the first few values to check convergence / numerical approximation.

**Alternative representation:**

\[
I = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
= - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} \right) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n} \right)
\]

But as above, \( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1} \) diverges, but we are working on the lengths over a finite region only, namely only for intervals that fit within \((0, 1]\).

But for each \(n\),
- Lower bound of the interval is \(x = \frac{1}{2n}\),
- Upper bound is \(x = \frac{1}{2n-1}\).

As \(n \to \infty\), both converge to 0, so all intervals are within \((0,1]\).

Therefore, the sum converges to the measure of the set, and our calculation is correct.

**So, in summary:**
\[
I = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right )
\]
This is an exact answer.

**Step 5: Numerical approximation**

Let's compute the sum up to \(n = 10^6\) to get a 10-decimal-digit approximation.

Alternatively, notice the sum in the parentheses is:

\[
S = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n} - \frac{1}{2n-1} \right )
\]
\[
= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n} - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1}
\]

But we know that
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} = \ln N + \gamma + o(1)
\]

But more usefully, the sum
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = \ln 2
\]
But
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots = \ln 2
\]

But our sum is
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n} - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1}
= \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} + \cdots \right ) - \left( 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots \right )
\]
So,
\[
S = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right ) = -\left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \right ) = - \ln 2
\]

But this would give \(\int_0^1 \left\lfloor \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{x} \right) \right\rfloor dx = \ln 2\), but our expression is negative that.

Explicitly:
\[
I = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2n-1} - \frac{1}{2n} \right ) = -\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \right ) = -\ln 2
\]

So,

\[
I = -\ln 2
\]

Thus, the exact answer is \(-\ln 2\).

**Step 6: Numerical value**

\[
-\ln 2 \approx -0.6931471806
\]
to 10 decimal places.
