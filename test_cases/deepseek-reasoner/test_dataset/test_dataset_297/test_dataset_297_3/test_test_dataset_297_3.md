Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x squared times E(sqrt(x)) times E(sqrt(1 - x)) dx. Hmm, first, I should clarify what E stands for here. Since the problem is about integrals, E is likely the elliptic integral. But there are different kinds of elliptic integrals. The notation E might refer to the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, which is usually denoted as E(m) or sometimes E(k), where m is the parameter or k is the modulus. Wait, but sometimes people use E(k) for the second kind, where k is the modulus. Let me confirm that.

The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - k² sin²θ) dθ. So, that's the one. So in this problem, we have E(sqrt(x)) and E(sqrt(1 - x)). So the integrand is x² E(sqrt(x)) E(sqrt(1 - x)). 

Alright, so the integral is ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me think about possible approaches. Elliptic integrals can be tricky, especially when multiplied together. Maybe there's a substitution that can simplify the product of the two E functions. Alternatively, perhaps expanding them in series and integrating term by term? Or maybe using some integral representations of the elliptic integrals and then switching the order of integration?

Let me recall that sometimes products of elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or other special functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry in the integral that can be exploited. Let's see, the limits are from 0 to 1, and the arguments of the E functions are sqrt(x) and sqrt(1 - x). If I make a substitution, say t = 1 - x, then when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 1 to 0. Let's check if the integrand has some symmetry under x → 1 - t.

Let me try substituting t = 1 - x. Then dx = -dt, and the integral becomes ∫₁⁰ (1 - t)² E(√(1 - t)) E(√t) (-dt) = ∫₀¹ (1 - t)² E(√(1 - t)) E(√t) dt. But since the variable of integration is a dummy variable, this is the same as ∫₀¹ (1 - x)² E(√(1 - x)) E(√x) dx. Comparing this to the original integral, which is ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. So the original integral is equal to ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx, and after substitution, it's ∫₀¹ (1 - x)² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. So if we add these two expressions, we get ∫₀¹ [x² + (1 - x)²] E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. But I don't know if that helps. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps averaging the two expressions. But maybe this symmetry isn't immediately helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding E(√x) and E(√(1 - x)) as series. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind has a series expansion. Let me recall that E(k) can be expressed as (π/2) times the sum from n=0 to ∞ of [ ( (2n)! ) / (2^{2n} (n!)^2 ) )^2 * (1 - 2n)/(1 - 2n) ) k^{2n} }? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact expansion. Alternatively, E(k) can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. Specifically, E(k) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). So maybe using hypergeometric function representations could help. Then, the product of two hypergeometric functions might be expressed as a double sum, and then integrating term by term. But integrating x² times two hypergeometric functions might be complicated. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps using integral representations. Since E(k) is an integral itself, maybe we can write the original integral as a triple integral and then switch the order of integration. Let's try that. Let me write E(√x) as ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) dθ, and similarly E(√(1 - x)) as ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ. Then the original integral becomes ∫₀¹ x² [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) dθ] [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ] dx. So this is a triple integral: ∫₀¹ x² ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dθ dφ dx. Maybe we can switch the order of integration, integrating over x first. So, switching the order, we have ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ x² sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx dθ dφ. Hmm, integrating x² times sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) times sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx from 0 to 1. That seems complicated, but maybe expanding the square roots as binomial series. Let me consider expanding each sqrt term.

The square roots can be written as (1 - x sin²θ)^{1/2} and (1 - (1 - x) sin²φ)^{1/2}. Using the binomial expansion, (1 - a)^(1/2) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (-1)^n (1/2 choose n) a^n ). But integrating term by term would lead to a double sum, multiplied by x². However, this might get very messy. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can combine the two square roots. Let me see. Let me denote A = sin²θ and B = sin²φ. Then the integrand becomes x² sqrt(1 - A x) sqrt(1 - B (1 - x)). Let me expand the product of the two square roots: sqrt( (1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) ). Let me compute the product inside the square root: (1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) = (1 - B)(1 - A x) + B x (1 - A x) = (1 - B) - (1 - B) A x + B x - A B x². Combining terms: (1 - B) + [ -A(1 - B) + B ] x - A B x². Let me compute the coefficients:

Constant term: 1 - B

Coefficient of x: -A(1 - B) + B = -A + A B + B = B(1 + A) - A

Coefficient of x²: -A B

So the product under the square root is 1 - B + (A - B(1 + A)) x - A B x². Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe this approach is not the best. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using integration by parts. Let me consider integrating x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. Let me set u = x², dv = E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. But then du = 2x dx, and v would be the integral of E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx, which seems even more complicated. So maybe integration by parts isn't helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using known integral formulas involving elliptic integrals. Let me check some references or tables. Wait, since I can't actually look up references, I need to recall from memory. I remember that sometimes products of elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of Meijer G-functions or other special functions, but I don't know the exact relations. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can turn the integral into a Beta function or Gamma function combination.

Alternatively, perhaps changing variables. Let me set t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t²)^2 E(t) E(√(1 - t²)) * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀¹ t^5 E(t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Hmm, not sure if that's better. Alternatively, set t = sqrt(1 - x), so x = 1 - t², dx = -2t dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₁⁰ (1 - t²)^2 E(√(1 - t²)) E(t) (-2t) dt = 2 ∫₀¹ t (1 - t²)^2 E(√(1 - t²)) E(t) dt. Again, similar to the previous substitution. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = sin²θ. Let me try that. Let x = sin²θ, so dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(x) = sinθ, and sqrt(1 - x) = cosθ. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (sin²θ)^2 E(sinθ) E(cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Simplifying, 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^5θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. Hmm, maybe this form is more manageable. But I don't see an obvious way to proceed. The product E(sinθ) E(cosθ) might have some known properties. Wait, there's a symmetry here between sinθ and cosθ. Maybe there's a relation when θ is replaced by π/2 - θ. Let me check. If we let φ = π/2 - θ, then sinθ = cosφ, cosθ = sinφ. So the integrand becomes sin^5(π/2 - φ) cos(π/2 - φ) E(cosφ) E(sinφ) * 2. But sin(π/2 - φ) = cosφ, cos(π/2 - φ) = sinφ. So sin^5(π/2 - φ) = cos^5φ, cos(π/2 - φ) = sinφ, so the integrand becomes 2 cos^5φ sinφ E(cosφ) E(sinφ). Which is the same as the original integrand with θ replaced by φ. So the integral from 0 to π/2 is the same as integrating 2 sin^5θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. But this doesn't seem to help directly. Maybe adding the two expressions? Wait, but they are the same. So perhaps this substitution doesn't lead to a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps using the product E(sinθ) E(cosθ). Is there a known identity for this product? I'm not sure, but maybe. Let me recall that E(k) and K(k) (the complete elliptic integral of the first kind) satisfy some identities. For example, there's a relation between E and K at complementary moduli. For example, E(k) + E'(k) = something, where E'(k) is the complementary integral. Wait, E'(k) = E(sqrt(1 - k²)). But in our case, we have E(sinθ) and E(cosθ), which are E(k) and E(sqrt(1 - k²)) if k = sinθ. So maybe there's a relation between E(k) and E(sqrt(1 - k²)) that can be used here. Let me check.

The complete elliptic integrals satisfy the relation E(k) = E'(k) + k^2 K(k) - k'^2 K'(k), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, there's Legendre's relation: K(k) E'(k) + K'(k) E(k) - K(k) K'(k) = π/2. But I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps expressing E(k) in terms of hypergeometric functions. As I mentioned earlier, E(k) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). So E(sinθ) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; sin²θ) and E(cosθ) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; cos²θ). Then the product would be (π/2)^2 times the product of two hypergeometric functions. But multiplying two hypergeometric functions is generally complicated, but maybe there's a product formula. Alternatively, perhaps using integral representations of hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric function {}_2F_1(a, b; c; z) can be represented as an integral, so maybe the product can be written as a double integral, leading to a triple integral overall, which might be reducible.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding both hypergeometric functions as power series and then multiplying them. Let's try that. So, E(sinθ) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose m) / (1 choose m) ] sin^{2m}θ. Similarly for E(cosθ). Then the product E(sinθ) E(cosθ) would be (π/2)^2 times the product of two such series. Then, integrating over θ with the other terms. But this seems very involved. Let me see if I can write this out.

First, the expansion of E(k) is E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (2^{2n} (n!)^2 ) ) * (1 - 2n)/(1 - 2n) ) ] k^{2n} }? Wait, no, the coefficients for the hypergeometric function {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²) are given by:

The general term of {}_2F_1(a, b; c; z) is (a)_n (b)_n / (c)_n n! z^n. So for a = -1/2, b = 1/2, c = 1, the nth term is [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n ] / [ (1)_n n! ] (k²)^n. 

Now, (-1/2)_n is the Pochhammer symbol, which is (-1/2)(-1/2 + 1)...(-1/2 + n -1). Similarly for (1/2)_n. Let's compute these. For example, (-1/2)_n = (-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)...( (2n - 3)/2 ) for n ≥ 1. Similarly, (1/2)_n = (1/2)(3/2)...( (2n - 1)/2 ). 

But perhaps there's a better way to express these terms. Alternatively, using the duplication formula or other properties of the Pochhammer symbols. Alternatively, note that the product of the two hypergeometric functions would be a double sum:

E(sinθ) E(cosθ) = (π/2)^2 Σ_{m=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] sin^{2m}θ cos^{2n}θ.

Then, the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^5θ cosθ * (π/2)^2 Σ_{m,n} [ ... ] sin^{2m}θ cos^{2n}θ dθ. 

So combining the exponents, we have sin^{5 + 2m}θ cos^{1 + 2n}θ. Then integrating over θ, the integral would be 2*(π/2)^2 Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{5 + 2m}θ cos^{1 + 2n}θ dθ. 

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{a}θ cos^{b}θ dθ is equal to (1/2) B( (a + 1)/2, (b + 1)/2 ), where B is the Beta function. So here, a = 5 + 2m, b = 1 + 2n. Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2) B( (6 + 2m)/2, (2 + 2n)/2 ) = (1/2) B(3 + m, 1 + n ). The Beta function B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p + q). So substituting, we get (1/2) Γ(3 + m) Γ(1 + n) / Γ(4 + m + n). 

But Γ(3 + m) = (2 + m)! , Γ(1 + n) = n! , and Γ(4 + m + n) = (3 + m + n)! So the integral becomes (1/2) ( (2 + m)! n! ) / (3 + m + n)! ). 

Putting it all together, the original integral becomes 2*(π/2)^2 Σ_{m,n} [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] * (1/2) ( (2 + m)! n! ) / (3 + m + n)! ). 

Simplifying constants: 2*(π²/4)*(1/2) = π²/4. So the integral is (π²/4) Σ_{m,n} [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] * ( (2 + m)! n! ) / (3 + m + n)! ). 

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a way to simplify the sum. Let's look at the terms. The coefficients involve Pochhammer symbols and factorials. Let me see if I can express (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m. 

Recall that (-1/2)_m = (-1)^m (2m - 1)!! / 2^m, but I need to check. For m=0, it's 1. For m=1, (-1/2), m=2, (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4, m=3, (-1/2)(1/2)(3/2) = -3/16, etc. Similarly, (1/2)_m = (2m)! )/(4^m m! ). Wait, perhaps there's a relation between the Pochhammer symbols and double factorials. Alternatively, perhaps using the product (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m. Let's compute this product:

(-1/2)_m (1/2)_m = [ (-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)...( (-1/2 + m -1 ) ) ] * [ (1/2)(3/2)...(1/2 + m -1 ) ]

But this seems messy. Alternatively, note that (-1/2)_m = ( (-1)^m (2m - 1)!! ) / 2^m. For example, m=1: (-1/2) = -1/2 = (-1)^1 (1!!)/2^1. m=2: (-1/2)(1/2) = (-1)^2 (3!!)/2^2 = (3*1)/4 = 3/4. Wait, but (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4, which is not 3/4. So that formula is incorrect. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, using the identity for the Pochhammer symbols: (a)_m (a + 1/2)_m = (2a)_2m / 4^m. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps expressing the product in terms of factorials. Let me compute for a general m:

(-1/2)_m = (-1/2)(-1/2 + 1)...(-1/2 + m -1) = (-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)...( (2m - 3)/2 )

Similarly, (1/2)_m = (1/2)(3/2)...( (2m -1)/2 )

So the product is [ (-1/2)(1/2)(3/2)...( (2m -3)/2 ) ] * [ (1/2)(3/2)...( (2m -1)/2 ) ] = (-1/2) * [ (1/2)(3/2)...( (2m -3)/2 ) ]^2 * ( (2m -1)/2 )

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, note that the product of the two Pochhammer symbols can be written as:

(-1/2)_m (1/2)_m = [ (-1/2)(1/2) ] [ (1/2)(3/2) ] [ (3/2)(5/2) ] ... up to m terms. Each pair is ( (-1/2 + k)(1/2 + k ) for k from 0 to m-1. Which is (k - 1/2)(k + 1/2) = k² - 1/4. So the product is Π_{k=0}^{m-1} (k² - 1/4). Hmm, but I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the duplication formula for Gamma functions. Since Pochhammer symbols can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions: (a)_m = Γ(a + m)/Γ(a). So (-1/2)_m = Γ(-1/2 + m)/Γ(-1/2), and (1/2)_m = Γ(1/2 + m)/Γ(1/2). Then the product is [ Γ(m - 1/2) / Γ(-1/2) ] [ Γ(m + 1/2) / Γ(1/2) ] = [ Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) ] / [ Γ(-1/2) Γ(1/2) ].

But Γ(-1/2) is -2 sqrt(π), and Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π). So the denominator is -2 sqrt(π) * sqrt(π) = -2 π. The numerator is Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2). Using the identity Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). So for z = m - 1/2, we have Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m) = 2^{1 - 2(m - 1/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1). Wait, but here we have Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2). Let me set z = m - 1/2, then Γ(z) Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z)^2. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, using the duplication formula again. For Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = π 2^{2 - 2m} Γ(2m - 1). Wait, let me check:

The duplication formula is Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). So if we set z = m - 1/2, then Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m) = 2^{1 - 2(m - 1/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1). But we have Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2). Let me see. Let z = m - 1/2, then Γ(z) Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z)^2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the identity. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to abandon this approach and consider that the series expansion might not be the best way to go. Let me think of another strategy.

Wait, perhaps using the integral representation of E(k) and switching the order of integration. Let me try that again. The original integral is ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. Expressing each E as an integral:

E(√x) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) dθ

E(√(1 - x)) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ

So the original integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x² [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) dθ] [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ] dx

= ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ x² sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx dθ dφ

Now, switching the order of integration, we have a triple integral. Let's focus on the innermost integral over x:

I(θ, φ) = ∫₀¹ x² sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx

This integral seems complicated, but maybe we can expand the square roots into binomial series. Let's denote A = sin²θ and B = sin²φ. Then the integrand becomes x² sqrt(1 - A x) sqrt(1 - B (1 - x)).

Let me expand each square root using the binomial theorem:

sqrt(1 - A x) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ ( (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) A^m x^m )

sqrt(1 - B (1 - x)) = sqrt(1 - B + B x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (-1)^n (1/2 choose n) B^n (x - 1)^n )

Wait, but (x - 1) is negative in the interval [0,1], so maybe better to write it as sqrt(1 - B + B x) = sqrt( (1 - B) + B x ). Let me make a substitution here. Let me set C = 1 - B, D = B. Then sqrt(C + D x) = sqrt(C) sqrt(1 + (D/C) x). So this can be written as sqrt(C) Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (-1)^n (1/2 choose n) (-D/C)^n x^n ). Wait, but the expansion of sqrt(1 + t) is Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose n) t^n ). So sqrt(C + D x) = sqrt(C) Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose n) (D/C)^n x^n ). But since D = B and C = 1 - B, this becomes sqrt(1 - B) Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose n) (B/(1 - B))^n x^n ). 

Therefore, the integrand becomes x² times [ Σ_{m=0}^∞ ( (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) A^m x^m ) ] times [ sqrt(1 - B) Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose n) (B/(1 - B))^n x^n ) ].

Multiplying these together:

x² * sqrt(1 - B) Σ_{m=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) A^m (1/2 choose n) (B/(1 - B))^n ) x^{m + n}

So the integral I(θ, φ) becomes sqrt(1 - B) Σ_{m,n} [ (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose n) A^m (B/(1 - B))^n ] ∫₀¹ x^{2 + m + n} dx.

The integral of x^{2 + m + n} from 0 to 1 is 1/(3 + m + n). Therefore,

I(θ, φ) = sqrt(1 - B) Σ_{m,n} [ (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose n) A^m (B/(1 - B))^n / (3 + m + n) ]

This is a double sum, which might be challenging to evaluate. However, perhaps there's a way to express this sum in terms of hypergeometric functions or other special functions. Alternatively, maybe we can find a generating function or use integral representations to simplify this.

Alternatively, perhaps switching back to the variables θ and φ. Recall that A = sin²θ and B = sin²φ. So sqrt(1 - B) = cosφ. Also, B/(1 - B) = tan²φ. So the expression becomes:

cosφ Σ_{m,n} [ (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose n) sin^{2m}θ tan^{2n}φ / (3 + m + n) ]

Hmm, but this still doesn't seem helpful. Maybe there's a way to relate m and n indices. Alternatively, perhaps changing variables in the sum. Let k = m + n, then n = k - m. But then the sum becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^k [ (-1)^m (1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose (k - m)) sin^{2m}θ tan^{2(k - m)}φ / (3 + k) ]

But this might not lead to a simplification. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that the sum over m and n can be expressed as a Kampé de Fériet function or some other hypergeometric function of two variables, but I'm not familiar enough with those to proceed.

Given that this approach is leading to very complicated expressions, perhaps there's a different method altogether. Let me think again. Maybe using differentiation under the integral sign. Suppose I consider a parameter that differentiates the integral into a more manageable form. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that E(k) satisfies a differential equation. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind satisfies the differential equation:

k(1 - k²) d²E/dk² + (1 - k²) dE/dk + k E = 0.

But I'm not sure how to use this here. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts with respect to x. Let me try that. Let me set u = x², dv = E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. Then du = 2x dx, and v is the integral of E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx, which I don't know. Alternatively, set u = E(√x) E(√(1 - x)), dv = x² dx. Then du would involve derivatives of E(√x) and E(√(1 - x)), which might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the derivative of E(k). The derivative of E(k) with respect to k is (E(k) - K(k))/k. So d/dk E(k) = (E(k) - K(k))/k. Maybe this can help if we differentiate the integral with respect to a parameter, but I don't see an obvious parameter to introduce.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the integral is a convolution-like structure. The product E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) resembles a convolution product, but over the multiplicative group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution x = sin^2θ, which I tried earlier, but then the expression became ∫ sin^5θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. Maybe integrating by parts in θ. Let me try that. Let me set u = E(sinθ) E(cosθ), dv = sin^5θ cosθ dθ. Then du would be [d/dθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) + E(sinθ) d/dθ E(cosθ) ] dθ. But differentiating E(sinθ) with respect to θ, we have d/dθ E(sinθ) = E'(sinθ) cosθ. Similarly, d/dθ E(cosθ) = -E'(cosθ) sinθ. So du = [ E'(sinθ) cosθ E(cosθ) - E(sinθ) E'(cosθ) sinθ ] dθ. This seems complicated. Meanwhile, dv = sin^5θ cosθ dθ. Integrating dv, we can set w = sinθ, then dv = w^5 dw, so v = w^6 /6 = sin^6θ /6. So integration by parts gives:

uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫ v du. The boundary term uv at π/2: sin^6(π/2) /6 * E(1) E(0). But E(1) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind at k=1, which is 1, since E(1) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - sin²θ) dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} cosθ dθ = 1. Similarly, E(0) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - 0) dθ = π/2. So uv at π/2 is (1^6 /6) * 1 * π/2) = π/(12). At 0, sinθ=0, so uv is 0. So the boundary term is π/12. Then the integral becomes π/12 - (1/6) ∫₀^{π/2} sin^6θ [ E'(sinθ) cosθ E(cosθ) - E(sinθ) E'(cosθ) sinθ ] dθ. This seems even more complicated than before. So integration by parts doesn't seem to help.

Given that all these methods are leading to very complicated expressions, perhaps this integral doesn't have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. But the problem says to compute it analytically to obtain the exact answer, so there must be a way. Maybe I'm missing a trick.

Wait, perhaps there's a substitution that can relate the integral to known constants. Let me consider specific values. For example, when x=0, the integrand is 0. When x=1, the integrand is 1^2 * E(1) * E(0) = 1 * 1 * π/2 = π/2. But integrating from 0 to 1, the integral is the area under the curve. But I need an exact value. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that E(k) and E(sqrt(1 - k²)) are related. For example, there's a relation between E(k) and E(sqrt(1 - k²)), but I don't recall it exactly. Let me think. Legendre's relation states that K(k) E'(k) + K'(k) E(k) - K(k) K'(k) = π/2, where K'(k) = K(sqrt(1 - k²)) and E'(k) = E(sqrt(1 - k²)). But I don't see how to apply this here. However, the product E(k) E(sqrt(1 - k²)) might be related to this. But I don't recall a direct identity.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral of E(k) over k. Let me check if there are known integrals involving E(k). For example, ∫ E(k) dk can be expressed in terms of other functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, integrating x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx might be a known integral. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution t = sqrt(x), which we tried earlier. Let me try that again. Let t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ t^5 E(t) E(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Now, perhaps expanding E(t) and E(sqrt(1 - t²)) as series and integrating term by term. Let me try that.

E(t) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! ) / (2^{2m} (m!)^2 ) )^2 * (1 - 2m) / (1 - 2m) ) ] t^{2m}? Wait, no. As before, E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose m) / (1 choose m) ] k^{2m}. Using the hypergeometric representation. So E(t) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] t^{2m}. Similarly, E(sqrt(1 - t²)) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] (1 - t²)^n. 

So the product E(t) E(sqrt(1 - t²)) = (π/2)^2 Σ_{m=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] t^{2m} (1 - t²)^n.

Then the integral becomes 2*(π/2)^2 ∫₀¹ t^5 Σ_{m,n} [ ... ] t^{2m} (1 - t²)^n dt. 

This is 2*(π²/4) Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] ∫₀¹ t^{5 + 2m} (1 - t²)^n} dt. 

Let me make a substitution in the integral: let u = t², so t = sqrt(u), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ u^{(5 + 2m)/2} (1 - u)^n * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{(4 + 2m)/2} (1 - u)^n du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{2 + m} (1 - u)^n du = (1/2) B(3 + m, n + 1) = (1/2) Γ(3 + m) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(4 + m + n).

So the integral is (π²/2) Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] * (1/2) Γ(3 + m) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(4 + m + n). 

Simplifying, this becomes (π²/4) Σ_{m,n} [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] Γ(3 + m) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(4 + m + n).

This is similar to the previous expression we had. Again, this seems very complex. Perhaps there's a way to simplify the ratio of Gamma functions. Let's write Γ(3 + m) = (2 + m)! and Γ(n + 1) = n!. Γ(4 + m + n) = (3 + m + n)! So the ratio is (2 + m)! n! / (3 + m + n)!.

But (3 + m + n)! = (3 + m + n)(2 + m + n)(1 + m + n) ... 1. Not sure. Alternatively, using the property of the Beta function: B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So the ratio Γ(3 + m)Γ(n + 1)/Γ(4 + m + n) = B(3 + m, n + 1). But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing the sum in terms of hypergeometric functions. For example, the sum over m and n might be expressible as a Kampé de Fériet function, but I'm not familiar enough with those to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that the sum can be separated into m and n parts. But due to the denominator (3 + m + n), the sums are coupled.

Given that this approach is not yielding progress, perhaps I need to look for another strategy. Let me think about numerical integration. The problem also requires a numerical approximation, so maybe I can compute it numerically and then see if the result matches a known constant. But the user wants an exact analytical solution first. 

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of known constants like π, Catalan's constant, etc. Let me compute the numerical value approximately. Let's see, using numerical methods. But since I can't actually compute it here, but maybe I can recall that integrals involving products of elliptic integrals sometimes evaluate to expressions involving π² or other constants. For example, perhaps this integral equals π²/16 or something similar. But I need to check.

Alternatively, let's consider specific values. When x=0.5, the integrand is (0.5)^2 * E(√0.5) * E(√0.5). Since E(√0.5) is a known value. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind at k=√(1/2) is E(√(1/2)) = [π^(3/2)] / [2 Γ(3/4)^2] + something? Wait, no, the exact value of E(k) for k=√(1/2) is known. Let me recall that E(√2/2) = (π^(3/2))/(2 Γ(3/4)^2) + Γ(1/4)^2/(8√(2π))). Wait, I might be misremembering. Alternatively, E(√2/2) can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. Let me check:

For k = sin(π/8), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the relation E(k) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). For k=√(1/2), k²=1/2. So E(√(1/2)) = (π/2) {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 1/2). The hypergeometric function {}_2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 1/2) can be evaluated using known formulas. There is a formula for {}_2F_1(a, b; c; 1/2). For example, using a table or known reduction. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

{}_2F_1(a, b; c; 1/2) = 2^{a} [Γ(c) Γ(c - a - b)] / [Γ(c - a) Γ(c - b)] ] {}_2F_1(a, b; a + b - c + 1; 1/2) when ... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, using the integral representation. For a = -1/2, b = 1/2, c = 1, z = 1/2.

Alternatively, using the identity:

{}_2F_1(a, b; c; z) = (1 - z)^{c -a - b} {}_2F_1(c - a, c - b; c; z). Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, using known special values. For example, when a = -1/2, b = 1/2, c = 1, z = 1/2. 

Alternatively, using the formula for {}_2F_1 at z=1/2. There's a formula in terms of Gamma functions. For example, when c - a - b = 1/2, which in this case, c - a - b = 1 - (-1/2) - 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 - 1/2 = 1. So it doesn't satisfy the condition for the 2F1 at z=1/2 to have a closed-form in terms of Gamma functions. 

Alternatively, using numerical approximation. For example, E(√(1/2)) ≈ 1.350643881. So then the integrand at x=0.5 is 0.25 * (1.350643881)^2 ≈ 0.25 * 1.824 ≈ 0.456. But integrating from 0 to 1, the total integral would be something. But this is just a single point, not helpful for the whole integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be evaluated numerically using techniques like Gaussian quadrature. But since I need to provide an exact answer first, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the substitution x = sin^2θ, which we did earlier, leading to 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^5θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. Let me consider expanding E(sinθ) and E(cosθ) in terms of their series expansions and then integrating term by term. 

E(sinθ) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2 choose m) (1/2 choose m) / ( (1)_m m! ) ] sin^{2m}θ

E(cosθ) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2 choose n) (1/2 choose n) / ( (1)_n n! ) ] cos^{2n}θ

Then the product is (π/2)^2 Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] sin^{2m}θ cos^{2n}θ. 

The integral becomes 2*(π/2)^2 Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{5 + 2m}θ cos^{1 + 2n}θ dθ. 

As before, the integral over θ is (1/2) B(3 + m, 1 + n). So the integral becomes (π²/2) Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] * (1/2) B(3 + m, 1 + n) = (π²/4) Σ_{m,n} [ coefficients ] * B(3 + m, 1 + n).

But B(3 + m, 1 + n) = Γ(3 + m)Γ(1 + n)/Γ(4 + m + n). So substituting the coefficients:

(π²/4) Σ_{m,n} [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] * Γ(3 + m)Γ(1 + n)/Γ(4 + m + n).

This seems similar to the previous expressions. Perhaps there's a way to simplify this sum. Let's look at the terms:

The term for m and n is:

[ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] * [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] * Γ(3 + m)Γ(1 + n)/Γ(4 + m + n).

Expressing the Pochhammer symbols in terms of Gamma functions:

(-1/2)_m = Γ(-1/2 + m)/Γ(-1/2)

(1/2)_m = Γ(1/2 + m)/Γ(1/2)

Similarly for the n terms. Also, (1)_m = Γ(1 + m)/Γ(1) = m!.

So substituting:

[ Γ(-1/2 + m)/Γ(-1/2) * Γ(1/2 + m)/Γ(1/2) ) / (m! m! ) ] * [ Γ(-1/2 + n)/Γ(-1/2) * Γ(1/2 + n)/Γ(1/2) ) / (n! n! ) ] * Γ(3 + m)Γ(1 + n)/Γ(4 + m + n).

This is getting very complicated, but perhaps there's a simplification using Gamma function properties. Let's recall that Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z). Also, Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), Γ(-1/2) = -2 sqrt(π).

Let's compute the m-dependent terms:

Γ(-1/2 + m) Γ(1/2 + m) / (Γ(-1/2) Γ(1/2) m!^2) * Γ(3 + m) 

Similarly for n. Let's handle the m terms first:

Γ(-1/2 + m) Γ(1/2 + m) / (Γ(-1/2) Γ(1/2) m!^2) * Γ(3 + m)

= [ Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) / ( (-2 sqrt(π)) sqrt(π) ) m!^2 ) ] * Γ(m + 3)

= [ Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) / ( -2 π m!^2 ) ] * Γ(m + 3)

Using the identity Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = π 2^{2 - 2m} Γ(2m - 1). Let me check this identity. For z = m - 1/2, the duplication formula is Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). So Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m) = 2^{1 - 2(m - 1/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1). Wait, but here we have Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2). Let me set z = m - 1/2, then Γ(z) Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z)^2. Not helpful. Alternatively, using the duplication formula for Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2):

Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = π 2^{2 - 2m} Γ(2m - 1). Is this correct? Let's check for m=1: Γ(1/2) Γ(3/2) = sqrt(π) * (sqrt(π)/2) = π/2. On the right-hand side: π 2^{0} Γ(1) = π * 1 * 1 = π. So this is incorrect. So the identity must be different. 

Alternatively, using the identity Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). For z = m - 1/2, this gives Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m) = 2^{1 - 2(m - 1/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1). So Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m) = 2^{2 - 2m} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1). Therefore, Γ(m - 1/2) = [2^{2 - 2m} sqrt(π) Γ(2m - 1)] / Γ(m). 

But we have Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2). Let me express Γ(m + 1/2) = (m - 1/2) Γ(m - 1/2). So Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = (m - 1/2) [Γ(m - 1/2)]^2. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! sqrt(π) / (4^m m! ). Similarly, Γ(m - 1/2) = (2m - 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{m - 1} (m - 1)! ) ). Let's check for m=1: Γ(1 + 1/2) = sqrt(π)/2, which matches (2*1)! sqrt(π)/(4^1 1!) = 2 sqrt(π)/4 = sqrt(π)/2. For Γ(m - 1/2) when m=1: Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), which matches (2*1 - 2)! sqrt(π)/(4^{0} 0! ) = 0! sqrt(π)/1 = sqrt(π). So yes, Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! sqrt(π) / (4^m m! ), and Γ(m - 1/2) = (2m - 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{m - 1} (m - 1)! ) ).

So Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = [ (2m - 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{m - 1} (m - 1)! ) ) ] * [ (2m)! sqrt(π) / (4^m m! ) ) ].

Simplifying:

= [ (2m - 2)! (2m)! (π) ) / (4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) ) ]

= [ π (2m - 2)! (2m)(2m - 1)(2m - 2)! ) / (4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) ) ]

Wait, no. Let's compute (2m)! = (2m)(2m - 1)(2m - 2)! So:

= π (2m - 2)! (2m)(2m - 1)(2m - 2)! ) / (4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) )

Wait, this seems messy. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately:

Numerator: (2m - 2)! * (2m)! * π

Denominator: 4^{m - 1} * 4^m * (m - 1)! * m! ) = 4^{2m - 1} * (m - 1)! m! )

But (2m)! = (2m)(2m - 1)(2m - 2)! ), so:

Numerator: (2m - 2)! * (2m)(2m - 1)(2m - 2)! ) * π = (2m)(2m - 1) [ (2m - 2)! ]^2 π

Denominator: 4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! )

So Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) = [ 2m(2m - 1) [ (2m - 2)! ]^2 π ] / [ 4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) ]

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let's return to the original term:

[ Γ(m - 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2) / ( -2 π m!^2 ) ] * Γ(m + 3)

Using the expressions for Γ(m + 1/2) and Γ(m - 1/2):

Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! sqrt(π) / (4^m m! )

Γ(m - 1/2) = (2m - 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{m - 1} (m - 1)! )

So substituting:

[ (2m - 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{m - 1} (m - 1)! ) ) * (2m)! sqrt(π) / (4^m m! ) ) ] / ( -2 π m!^2 ) ) * Γ(m + 3)

= [ (2m - 2)! (2m)! π / (4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) ) ] / ( -2 π m!^2 ) ) * Γ(m + 3)

Simplifying:

= [ (2m - 2)! (2m)! / (4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m! ) ) ] / ( -2 m!^2 ) ) * Γ(m + 3)

= (2m - 2)! (2m)! Γ(m + 3) / ( -2 * 4^{2m - 1} (m - 1)! m!^3 ) )

This is extremely complicated. It seems like this approach is not leading to a simplification. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might need to consider that this integral might not have a simple closed-form expression, but the problem states that it should be computed analytically. Therefore, perhaps there's a trick or identity I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the product E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) might be related to a known integral. Let me check if there's a known integral formula involving the product. After some research (though I can't actually do that), I recall that there's an integral formula:

∫₀¹ E(k) E(√(1 - k²)) dk = (π²/4) - (something). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts in a clever way. Let me try one more time.

Let me consider the original integral ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. Let me make the substitution t = √x, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ t^5 E(t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Now, let me consider integrating by parts. Let u = t^4, dv = t E(t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Then du = 4t^3 dt, and v = ∫ t E(t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. But I don't know v. Alternatively, set u = E(t) E(√(1 - t²)), dv = t^5 dt. Then du = [E’(t) E(√(1 - t²)) + E(t) E’(√(1 - t²)) * (-t)/√(1 - t²) ] dt, which is complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the derivative of E(t). As mentioned earlier, d/dt E(t) = (E(t) - K(t))/t. Similarly, d/dt E(√(1 - t²)) = [E’(√(1 - t²)) * (-t)/√(1 - t²) ] = [ (E(√(1 - t²)) - K(√(1 - t²)) ) / √(1 - t²) ] * (-t)/√(1 - t²) ) = -t (E(√(1 - t²)) - K(√(1 - t²)) ) / (1 - t²). 

This seems too complicated. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the answer is a simple multiple of π². Let me assume that the integral evaluates to π²/16. To check, let's compute the numerical value. π²/16 ≈ (9.8696)/16 ≈ 0.61685. But I need to verify this. Alternatively, if I recall that ∫₀¹ E(√x) dx = π²/4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is π²/8. Let me compute π²/8 ≈ 1.2337. But without actual computation, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is related to the product of two integrals. For example, ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx. If we consider that E(√x) and E(√(1 - x)) are functions that peak at x=0 and x=1 respectively, their product might have a certain symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution despite trying multiple methods, I might need to concede that I can't solve this integral analytically and that perhaps the answer is a known result. However, the problem states that it should be computed analytically, so there must be a way. 

Wait, perhaps using the substitution x = sin²θ, which we did earlier, leading to 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^5θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. Let me consider integrating by parts with u = sin^4θ and dv = sinθ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. Then du = 4 sin^3θ cosθ dθ, and v = ∫ sinθ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ. But again, v is complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for the product E(sinθ) E(cosθ). Let me recall that there's an identity involving the product of two complete elliptic integrals of the second kind. After some research (hypothetically), I find that there's an identity:

E(k) E(sqrt(1 - k²)) = (π²/4) [1 + (k² (1 - k²))/4 + ... ].

But this is a series expansion, not helpful for integration. Alternatively, perhaps there's an integral representation of the product. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that E(k) and E(sqrt(1 - k²)) are related through Legendre's relation. Legendre's relation states that K(k) E(sqrt(1 - k²)) + K(sqrt(1 - k²)) E(k) - K(k) K(sqrt(1 - k²)) = π/2. But I don't see how to use this to express the product E(k) E(sqrt(1 - k²)).

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the answer is a simple fraction of π². Let me assume that the integral evaluates to π²/16. To check numerically, π²/16 ≈ 0.61685. Alternatively, if I compute the integral numerically using approximate methods, but since I can't compute it here, I'll have to make an educated guess. However, given the problem requires an exact answer, I must have missed a key insight.

Wait, perhaps using the integral representation of E(k) and switching the order of integration. Let me try that again. The original integral is:

I = ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1 - x)) dx

Expressing E(√x) and E(√(1 - x)) as integrals:

I = ∫₀¹ x² [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) dθ] [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ] dx

= ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ x² sqrt(1 - x sin²θ) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx dθ dφ

Let me change variables in the innermost integral. Let t = x, so the integral over x is from 0 to 1. The integrand is x² sqrt(1 - x A) sqrt(1 - (1 - x) B), where A = sin²θ and B = sin²φ. Let me expand the product of the square roots:

sqrt( (1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) ) = sqrt( (1 - B) + B x - A x + A B x² )

But this doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps making a substitution in x. Let me set y = x - 1/2, but not sure. Alternatively, completing the square in the expression under the square root. Let me see:

The expression inside the square root is:

(1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) = (1 - B) + (B - A) x - A B x²

This is a quadratic in x. Let me write it as -A B x² + (B - A) x + (1 - B). The quadratic is -A B x² + (B - A) x + (1 - B). Let me factor this quadratic. The discriminant is (B - A)^2 + 4 A B (1 - B). But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution to linearize the quadratic. Let me set u = x - h, but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps using a trigonometric substitution for the quadratic. But this is getting too involved. 

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution, I might have to conclude that the integral evaluates to π²/16, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is π²/16, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.61685. However, to verify, I would need to compute it numerically. Since the problem requires both the exact and numerical answer, and given the time I've spent without progress, I'll proceed to provide the answer as π²/16 with the corresponding numerical value. However, I'm not certain and this might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is π²/8, which is approximately 1.2337. But without further insight, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the average value of E(k) over k from 0 to 1 is π²/8. If that's the case, then integrating x² times E(k) E(sqrt(1 - k)) might relate to this average. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is π²/16. 

Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that the exact answer is π²/16 and the numerical value is approximately 0.6168502756. However, I must note that this might be incorrect due to the lack of a proper derivation.
