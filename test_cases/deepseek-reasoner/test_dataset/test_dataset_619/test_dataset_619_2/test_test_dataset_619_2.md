Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (arctan(x) + arccot(x)) divided by (x² + 1) dx. Hmm, first, I should recall some properties of arctan and arccot. Wait, arccot(x) is the inverse cotangent function. I remember that arctan(x) + arccot(x) is a constant. Let me check that.

Yes, arctan(x) and arccot(x) are cofunctions. For any x, arctan(x) + arccot(x) = π/2. Because if you think of a right triangle, the two non-right angles add up to π/2. So, arctan(x) is one angle, and arccot(x) is the other. So their sum is π/2. That simplifies the integral a lot!

So the integrand becomes (π/2) divided by (x² + 1). Therefore, the integral simplifies to (π/2) times the integral from 0 to 1 of 1/(x² + 1) dx. 

The integral of 1/(x² + 1) dx is arctan(x) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1, that's arctan(1) - arctan(0). Arctan(1) is π/4, and arctan(0) is 0. So the integral of 1/(x² +1) from 0 to 1 is π/4 - 0 = π/4.

Therefore, multiplying by π/2, the original integral is (π/2)*(π/4) = π²/8.

Wait, let me verify that again. If arctan(x) + arccot(x) is π/2, then the numerator is π/2. So the integrand is π/(2(x² +1)). Then integrating from 0 to 1/(x² +1) dx is π/4. So π/2 * π/4 is π²/8. That seems right.

So the exact answer is π²/8. Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute π² divided by 8. Pi is approximately 3.1415926536. Squaring that gives about 9.8696044011. Divided by 8 is approximately 1.2337005501. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.2337005501. Let me check with a calculator. Pi squared is indeed approximately 9.8696044, so divided by 8 is 9.8696044 /8 ≈ 1.23370055. So yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is π²/8, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.2337005501.
