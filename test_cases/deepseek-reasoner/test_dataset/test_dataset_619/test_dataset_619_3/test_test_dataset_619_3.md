Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (arctan(x) + arccot(x)) divided by (x² + 1) dx. Hmm, first, I should recall some properties of arctan and arccot. Wait, arccot(x) is the inverse cotangent function. I remember that arctan(x) + arccot(x) is a constant. Let me check that.

If I take arctan(x) + arccot(x), what's that equal to? Let's think. For any x, arctan(x) is the angle whose tangent is x, and arccot(x) is the angle whose cotangent is x. Since cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, maybe they add up to π/2. Let me verify with x = 1. arctan(1) is π/4, arccot(1) is also π/4, so π/4 + π/4 = π/2. Wait, that's π/2. Wait, but for x=1, arccot(1) is π/4? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check the definitions.

Actually, arccot(x) is defined as the angle whose cotangent is x. So cot(theta) = x, which is equivalent to tan(theta) = 1/x. So arccot(x) = arctan(1/x) when x > 0. But when x > 0, arctan(x) + arctan(1/x) = π/2. So yes, arctan(x) + arccot(x) = π/2 for all x > 0. So in the integrand, the numerator simplifies to π/2. That's a key insight!

So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of (π/2) divided by (x² + 1) dx. So that's (π/2) times the integral of 1/(x² +1) dx from 0 to 1. The integral of 1/(x² +1) dx is arctan(x), right? So the integral from 0 to 1 is arctan(1) - arctan(0). arctan(1) is π/4, arctan(0) is 0. So that's π/4. Therefore, multiplying by π/2 gives (π/2)*(π/4) = π²/8.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. If arctan(x) + arccot(x) is indeed π/2, then the integrand simplifies to π/(2(x² +1)). Then integrating that from 0 to 1. The integral of 1/(x² +1) is arctan(x), so evaluated from 0 to 1, that's π/4. So π/2 * π/4 = π²/8. That seems correct.

So the exact answer is π squared over 8. For the numerical approximation, π is approximately 3.1415926536. So π squared is about 9.869604401, divided by 8 gives approximately 1.2337005501. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.2337005501. Let me check with a calculator. π² is indeed approximately 9.8696044, so 9.8696044 /8 = 1.23370055. So yes, 1.2337005501 when rounded to 10 decimals.

Wait, but let me confirm the step where arctan(x) + arccot(x) equals π/2. For x positive. Let me take x = 0. arctan(0) is 0, arccot(0) is π/2, so 0 + π/2 = π/2. For x approaching infinity, arctan(x) approaches π/2, arccot(x) approaches 0, so sum is π/2. So yes, for all real x, arctan(x) + arccot(x) = π/2. Therefore, the numerator is indeed π/2. So the integral simplifies as I thought.

Therefore, the steps are correct. The exact value is π²/8, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.2337005501.
