Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^(-3/2) times the natural logarithm of (1 - 0.5x) multiplied by another logarithm, which is ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)]. Hmm, that looks pretty complicated. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me write the integral more clearly:

∫₀² x^(-3/2) ln(1 - 0.5x) ln[(√2 + √(2 - x))/√x] dx

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that the integrand has x raised to a negative power, which might cause issues at the lower limit (x approaching 0). Also, the upper limit at x=2 might have some terms involving sqrt(2 - x), which could lead to another potential singularity. So I need to check if the integral converges. But maybe the logarithms temper the singularities. Let me think. As x approaches 0, x^(-3/2) blows up, but ln(1 - 0.5x) ~ ln(1) = 0, and the other logarithm term ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2))/sqrt(x)] = ln[(2√2)/sqrt(x)] = ln(2√2) - (1/2)ln x. So near x=0, the integrand behaves like x^(-3/2) * (-0.5x) * (-1/2 ln x) = (0.25 x^(-1/2) ln x). Wait, integrating x^(-1/2) ln x from 0 to something. The integral of x^(-1/2) is 2x^(1/2), which converges at 0. The ln x term would make it go to zero? Wait, let's see. The behavior near 0: x^(-3/2) * ln(1 - 0.5x) * ln(...). Let me approximate each term as x approaches 0.

ln(1 - 0.5x) ≈ -0.5x - (0.5x)^2/2 - ... ≈ -0.5x for small x.

The other logarithm term: ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)].

When x is near 0, sqrt(2 - x) ≈ sqrt(2) - x/(2 sqrt(2)), so sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x) ≈ sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) - x/(2 sqrt(2)) = 2 sqrt(2) - x/(2 sqrt(2)). Then dividing by sqrt(x):

[2 sqrt(2) - x/(2 sqrt(2))]/sqrt(x) = 2 sqrt(2)/sqrt(x) - x/(2 sqrt(2) sqrt(x)) = 2 sqrt(2) x^(-1/2) - (1/2 sqrt(2)) x^(1/2).

Taking the natural log of that expression. The dominant term as x approaches 0 is 2 sqrt(2) x^(-1/2), so ln(2 sqrt(2) x^(-1/2) (1 - x/(8) + ...) ≈ ln(2 sqrt(2)) - (1/2) ln x + ln(1 - x/8 + ...) ≈ ln(2 sqrt(2)) - (1/2) ln x - x/8.

So combining the two logarithms:

ln(1 - 0.5x) ≈ -0.5x

ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] ≈ ln(2 sqrt(2)) - (1/2) ln x - x/8

Multiplying these together:

(-0.5x) * [ln(2 sqrt(2)) - (1/2) ln x - x/8] ≈ -0.5x ln(2 sqrt(2)) + 0.25 x ln x + 0.0625 x^2

Then multiply by x^(-3/2):

x^(-3/2) * [ -0.5x ln(2 sqrt(2)) + 0.25 x ln x + 0.0625 x^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

-0.5 x^(-1/2) ln(2 sqrt(2)) + 0.25 x^(-1/2) ln x + 0.0625 x^(1/2)

So integrating term by term near x=0:

The first term: -0.5 ln(2 sqrt(2)) x^(-1/2). The integral of x^(-1/2) is 2 x^(1/2), so this term would integrate to -0.5 ln(2 sqrt(2)) * 2 x^(1/2) evaluated from 0 to 2. At x=0, it's 0, so that's okay.

The second term: 0.25 x^(-1/2) ln x. The integral of x^(-1/2) ln x dx. Let me recall that ∫ x^a ln x dx = x^(a+1)/(a+1)^2 [ (a+1) ln x -1 ] + C. For a = -1/2, this becomes x^(1/2)/( (1/2)^2 ) [ (1/2) ln x -1 ] = 4 x^(1/2) [ (1/2 ln x -1 ) ] = 2 x^(1/2) ln x - 4 x^(1/2). So multiplying by 0.25, the integral is 0.25*(2 x^(1/2) ln x -4 x^(1/2)) = 0.5 x^(1/2) ln x - x^(1/2). Evaluated from 0 to 2. At x=0, x^(1/2) ln x tends to 0 (since x^(1/2) goes to 0 and ln x goes to -infty, but x^(1/2) dominates), so the limit is 0. So the second term is finite.

Third term: 0.0625 x^(1/2). The integral is 0.0625*(2/3) x^(3/2) = (0.041666...) x^(3/2). At x=0, it's 0.

So overall, near x=0, the integral converges. Similarly, near x=2, let's check. As x approaches 2, sqrt(2 - x) approaches 0. The term ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] becomes ln[ (sqrt(2) + 0)/sqrt(2) ] = ln(1) = 0. So the integrand at x=2 is x^(-3/2) ln(1 - 0.5x) * 0, which is 0. But let's check the approach. Let x = 2 - ε, ε approaching 0+.

ln(1 - 0.5x) = ln(1 - 0.5*(2 - ε)) = ln(1 -1 + 0.5ε) = ln(0.5ε) = ln(0.5) + ln ε.

The other logarithm term: ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(ε))/sqrt(2 - ε)]. As ε approaches 0, sqrt(ε) is small, so sqrt(2) + sqrt(ε) ≈ sqrt(2), and sqrt(2 - ε) ≈ sqrt(2) - So the argument becomes sqrt(2)/sqrt(2 - ε) ≈ 1 + ε/(4 sqrt(2)) for small ε. So ln(1 + ε/(4 sqrt(2))) ≈ ε/(4 sqrt(2)).

So the product of the two logarithms is [ln(0.5) + ln ε] * [ε/(4 sqrt(2))] ≈ (ln 0.5) * ε/(4 sqrt(2)) + (ln ε) * ε/(4 sqrt(2)).

Multiply by x^(-3/2) = (2 - ε)^(-3/2) ≈ (2)^(-3/2) (1 + 3ε/(4*2)) ) ≈ 2^(-3/2) (1 + 3ε/8).

So the integrand near x=2 is approximately 2^(-3/2) [ (ln 0.5) * ε/(4 sqrt(2)) + (ln ε) * ε/(4 sqrt(2)) ] * (1 + 3ε/8). The leading term is 2^(-3/2) * ln 0.5 * ε/(4 sqrt(2)) = (ln 0.5)/(4 * 2^(3/2) * sqrt(2)) ) * ε. Wait, 2^(-3/2) * 1/(4 sqrt(2)) = 2^(-3/2 - 2) = 2^(-7/2). Hmm, but multiplied by ε. So the integrand behaves like O(ε) as ε approaches 0. Therefore, the integral near x=2 is convergent. So overall, the integral is convergent.

Now, how to compute it analytically. The integrand is x^(-3/2) ln(1 - x/2) ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)].

Hmm. Let me try to simplify the logarithm terms. Let's first look at the second logarithm:

ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)].

Let me write that as ln(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x)) - (1/2) ln x.

But maybe there's a substitution that can simplify this expression. Let me consider substituting t = sqrt((2 - x)/x). Let's see:

Let t = sqrt( (2 - x)/x ). Then t^2 = (2 - x)/x => t^2 x = 2 - x => x(t^2 + 1) = 2 => x = 2/(t^2 + 1). Then dx/dt = -2*(2t)/(t^2 +1)^2 = -4t/(t^2 +1)^2. Wait, let me compute dx/dt properly.

Wait, x = 2/(1 + t^2). So dx/dt = 2*(-2t)/(1 + t^2)^2 = -4t/(1 + t^2)^2.

But when x goes from 0 to 2, t = sqrt((2 - x)/x). When x approaches 0, t approaches sqrt(2/0) which is infinity. When x = 2, t = sqrt(0/2) = 0. So the substitution t from infinity to 0. But since dx is negative, we can reverse the limits:

∫₀² ... dx = ∫_{∞}^0 ... (-4t)/(1 + t^2)^2 dt = ∫₀^∞ ... (4t)/(1 + t^2)^2 dt.

Let me express the integrand in terms of t. First, x = 2/(1 + t^2). Then sqrt(x) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(1 + t^2). sqrt(2 - x) = sqrt(2 - 2/(1 + t^2)) = sqrt( 2(1 + t^2) - 2 ) / sqrt(1 + t^2) ) = sqrt(2 t^2)/sqrt(1 + t^2) ) = t sqrt(2)/sqrt(1 + t^2).

Therefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x) = sqrt(2) + t sqrt(2)/sqrt(1 + t^2) = sqrt(2) [1 + t / sqrt(1 + t^2)].

So the logarithm term:

ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] = ln[ sqrt(2) (1 + t / sqrt(1 + t^2)) / (sqrt(2)/sqrt(1 + t^2)) ) ] = ln[ (1 + t / sqrt(1 + t^2)) * sqrt(1 + t^2) / 1 ) ]

= ln[ sqrt(1 + t^2) + t ]

But sqrt(1 + t^2) + t is a known expression. Let me note that sqrt(1 + t^2) + t = e^{sinh^{-1}(t)}. Because sinh^{-1}(t) = ln(t + sqrt(1 + t^2)), so e^{sinh^{-1}(t)} = t + sqrt(1 + t^2). Therefore, ln(sqrt(1 + t^2) + t) = sinh^{-1}(t). So that logarithm term simplifies to sinh^{-1}(t).

So the second logarithm term becomes sinh^{-1}(t).

Now, the first logarithm term: ln(1 - 0.5x). Since x = 2/(1 + t^2), 1 - 0.5x = 1 - 1/(1 + t^2) = t^2/(1 + t^2). So ln(t^2/(1 + t^2)) = ln t^2 - ln(1 + t^2) = 2 ln t - ln(1 + t^2).

So the integrand becomes:

x^(-3/2) * [2 ln t - ln(1 + t^2)] * sinh^{-1}(t) * (4t)/(1 + t^2)^2.

But x^(-3/2) = [2/(1 + t^2)]^(-3/2) = (1 + t^2)^(3/2) / 2^(3/2).

So putting it all together:

Integral = ∫₀^∞ [ (1 + t^2)^(3/2) / 2^(3/2) ) ] * [2 ln t - ln(1 + t^2)] * sinh^{-1}(t) * [4 t / (1 + t^2)^2 ] dt

Simplify the terms:

Multiply the constants: 1/2^(3/2) * 4 = 4 / (2^(3/2)) = 2^(2) / 2^(3/2) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2).

The (1 + t^2)^(3/2) divided by (1 + t^2)^2 is (1 + t^2)^(-1/2).

So the integrand simplifies to:

sqrt(2) * t * (1 + t^2)^(-1/2) * [2 ln t - ln(1 + t^2)] * sinh^{-1}(t) dt

So Integral = sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ [ t / sqrt(1 + t^2) ] [2 ln t - ln(1 + t^2)] sinh^{-1}(t) dt

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to proceed. Let's note that sinh^{-1}(t) = ln(t + sqrt(1 + t^2)). But we already used that earlier. Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me set u = sinh^{-1}(t). Then t = sinh u, dt = cosh u du. Then sqrt(1 + t^2) = cosh u. So let's try substituting u = sinh^{-1}(t). Then when t goes from 0 to ∞, u goes from 0 to ∞.

So substituting:

Integral = sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ [ sinh u / cosh u ] [2 ln(sinh u) - ln(cosh^2 u) ] * u * cosh u du

Simplify:

sinh u / cosh u * cosh u = sinh u. So the integral becomes:

sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ sinh u [2 ln(sinh u) - 2 ln(cosh u) ] u du

Because ln(cosh^2 u) = 2 ln(cosh u). So the expression inside the brackets is 2 [ ln(sinh u) - ln(cosh u) ] = 2 ln(tanh u).

Therefore, Integral = sqrt(2) * 2 ∫₀^∞ u sinh u ln(tanh u) du

So Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ u sinh u ln(tanh u) du

Hmm, this seems challenging. Let's see. The integrand is u sinh u ln(tanh u). Maybe integrating by parts. Let me set:

Let me set v = u, dv = du

dw = sinh u ln(tanh u) du, then w is the integral of sinh u ln(tanh u) du. Hmm, but integrating sinh u ln(tanh u) du might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution.

Alternatively, note that tanh u = (e^u - e^{-u})/(e^u + e^{-u}) = (e^{2u} -1)/(e^{2u} +1). So ln(tanh u) = ln(e^{2u} -1) - ln(e^{2u} +1). Maybe express in terms of exponentials.

But perhaps another approach. Let me consider substitution z = e^{-2u}. Then as u goes from 0 to ∞, z goes from 1 to 0. Let me try that. Let z = e^{-2u}, so u = - (1/2) ln z, du = -1/(2z)) dz.

But sinh u = (e^u - e^{-u})/2 = (e^u - e^{-u})/2. If z = e^{-2u}, then e^u = z^{-1/2}, e^{-u} = z^{1/2}. So sinh u = (z^{-1/2} - z^{1/2})/2 = (1 - z)/(2 z^{1/2}).

Similarly, tanh u = (e^u - e^{-u})/(e^u + e^{-u}) = (1 - z)/(1 + z).

So ln(tanh u) = ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z).

So substituting into the integral:

Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ u sinh u [ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z)] du

But z = e^{-2u}, so when u = 0, z=1; u=∞, z=0. So changing variables to z:

u = - (1/2) ln z, du = -1/(2z) dz. So the integral becomes:

2 sqrt(2) ∫₁⁰ [ - (1/2) ln z ] * [ (1 - z)/(2 z^{1/2}) ] [ ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z) ] * (-1/(2z)) dz

Simplify the signs and factors:

The integral from 1 to 0 becomes integral from 0 to 1, and the two negatives cancel. So:

2 sqrt(2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) ∫₀¹ ln z * (1 - z)/z^{1/2} [ ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z) ] / z dz

Wait, let's compute all the constants:

2 sqrt(2) * (1/2) [from u], * (1/2) [from sinh u], * (1/2) [from du], so total constants: 2 sqrt(2) * (1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 2 sqrt(2) * 1/8 = sqrt(2)/4.

The integrand becomes:

ln z * (1 - z)/z^{1/2} * [ ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z) ] / z

Simplify the z terms: (1 - z)/z^{1/2} / z = (1 - z) / z^{3/2}

So the integral is:

sqrt(2)/4 ∫₀¹ ln z * (1 - z) / z^{3/2} [ ln(1 - z) - ln(1 + z) ] dz

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me write it as:

sqrt(2)/4 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z) / z^{3/2} ] ln z [ ln((1 - z)/(1 + z)) ] dz

Alternatively, split into two integrals:

sqrt(2)/4 [ ∫₀¹ (1 - z) ln z ln(1 - z) / z^{3/2} dz - ∫₀¹ (1 - z) ln z ln(1 + z) / z^{3/2} dz ]

This still looks difficult. Maybe expanding the terms. Let me consider the first integral:

I1 = ∫₀¹ (1 - z) ln z ln(1 - z) / z^{3/2} dz

And the second integral:

I2 = ∫₀¹ (1 - z) ln z ln(1 + z) / z^{3/2} dz

So the integral becomes sqrt(2)/4 (I1 - I2)

Let me see if I can handle I1 and I2 separately.

Starting with I1:

I1 = ∫₀¹ (1 - z) z^{-3/2} ln z ln(1 - z) dz

Let me split (1 - z) as 1 - z:

= ∫₀¹ [ z^{-3/2} - z^{-1/2} ] ln z ln(1 - z) dz

= ∫₀¹ z^{-3/2} ln z ln(1 - z) dz - ∫₀¹ z^{-1/2} ln z ln(1 - z) dz

But z^{-3/2} ln z ln(1 - z) near z=0: z^{-3/2} * z^0 * z^1 (since ln(1 - z) ~ -z) so overall ~ z^{-1/2}, which is integrable? Wait, z^{-3/2} * z * ln z ~ z^{-1/2} ln z. The integral of z^{-1/2} ln z from 0 to 1 is convergent. Let me check:

∫ z^{-1/2} ln z dz. Let substitution t = sqrt(z), z = t^2, dz = 2t dt. Then integral becomes ∫ (1/t) * ln(t^2) * 2t dt = 2 ∫ 2 ln t * 2t dt? Wait, no:

Wait, z^{-1/2} = t^{-1}, ln z = ln t^2 = 2 ln t, dz = 2t dt. So:

∫ z^{-1/2} ln z dz = ∫ t^{-1} * 2 ln t * 2t dt = 4 ∫ ln t dt. From t=0 to t=1. But ∫ ln t dt = t ln t - t. Evaluated from 0 to 1: (1*0 -1) - (0 -0) = -1. So the integral is 4*(-1) = -4. So yes, it's convergent.

So I1 is a difference of two convergent integrals. However, integrating them might be challenging. Let me consider expanding ln(1 - z) as a power series. Since for |z| <1, ln(1 - z) = - Σ_{n=1}^∞ z^n /n.

Similarly, ln(1 + z) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} z^n /n.

So perhaps expanding the logarithms into their series and interchange the sum and integral. Let's try that for I1.

For I1:

I1 = ∫₀¹ [ z^{-3/2} - z^{-1/2} ] ln z [ - Σ_{n=1}^∞ z^n /n ] dz

= - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) ∫₀¹ [ z^{-3/2} - z^{-1/2} ] ln z * z^n dz

= - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) ∫₀¹ [ z^{n - 3/2} - z^{n - 1/2} ] ln z dz

Similarly, for each term, we can compute ∫ z^{k} ln z dz. The integral of z^k ln z dz is z^{k+1}/(k+1)^2 [ (k+1) ln z -1 ] + C. Evaluated from 0 to 1. At z=1, it's [0 -1]/(k+1)^2. At z=0, if k+1 >0, then z^{k+1} ln z approaches 0. So for convergence, we need k+1 >0. For the integrals in I1:

For the first part: z^{n - 3/2} ln z. The exponent is n - 3/2. When n=1: 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So k = n - 3/2. So k +1 = n - 1/2. For n ≥1, k +1 ≥ 1 -1/2 = 1/2 >0. So the integral converges.

Similarly for the second term: z^{n -1/2} ln z. Exponent k = n -1/2. k +1 = n +1/2 >0.

Therefore, the integral for each term is:

∫₀¹ z^{k} ln z dz = -1/(k +1)^2.

So for the first part, k = n - 3/2:

∫₀¹ z^{n - 3/2} ln z dz = -1/(n - 3/2 +1)^2 = -1/(n - 1/2)^2

Similarly, the second part, k = n -1/2:

∫₀¹ z^{n -1/2} ln z dz = -1/(n -1/2 +1)^2 = -1/(n +1/2)^2

Therefore, I1 becomes:

- Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) [ -1/(n -1/2)^2 + 1/(n +1/2)^2 ]

= Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) [ 1/(n -1/2)^2 - 1/(n +1/2)^2 ]

Similarly, for I2:

I2 = ∫₀¹ (1 - z) ln z ln(1 + z) / z^{3/2} dz

Again, split into two integrals:

= ∫₀¹ z^{-3/2} (1 - z) ln z ln(1 + z) dz

= ∫₀¹ [ z^{-3/2} - z^{-1/2} ] ln z Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m+1} z^m /m dz

= Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/m ∫₀¹ [ z^{m -3/2} - z^{m -1/2} ] ln z dz

Similarly, each integral is:

∫₀¹ z^{k} ln z dz = -1/(k +1)^2

So for the first term, k = m -3/2:

-1/(m -3/2 +1)^2 = -1/(m -1/2)^2

Second term, k = m -1/2:

-1/(m -1/2 +1)^2 = -1/(m +1/2)^2

Therefore, I2 becomes:

Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/m [ -1/(m -1/2)^2 + 1/(m +1/2)^2 ]

= Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/m [ -1/(m -1/2)^2 + 1/(m +1/2)^2 ]

= Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m}/m [ 1/(m -1/2)^2 - 1/(m +1/2)^2 ]

So putting it all together, the original integral is sqrt(2)/4 (I1 - I2) = sqrt(2)/4 [ Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ) - Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m}/m (1/(m -1/2)^2 -1/(m +1/2)^2 ) ]

Notice that the second sum is over m, but m is a dummy variable. So we can write:

Integral = sqrt(2)/4 [ Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ) + Σ_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/m (1/(m -1/2)^2 -1/(m +1/2)^2 ) ]

This can be combined into a single sum:

Integral = sqrt(2)/4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1/n (1 - (-1)^{n+1}) ] [1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the first sum is over n with coefficient 1/n, and the second sum is over m with coefficient (-1)^{m}/m. So actually, it's:

Integral = sqrt(2)/4 [ Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n)(1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ) + Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n}/n (1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ) ]

So combining the two sums:

= sqrt(2)/4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ [1 + (-1)^n ] /n [1/(n -1/2)^2 -1/(n +1/2)^2 ]

But [1 + (-1)^n ] is 0 when n is odd, and 2 when n is even. So we can write the sum as over even n:

Let n = 2k, k=1,2,...

Then:

= sqrt(2)/4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [2/(2k)] [1/(2k -1/2)^2 -1/(2k +1/2)^2 ]

= sqrt(2)/4 * 2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(2k)] [1/( (4k -1)/2 )^2 -1/( (4k +1)/2 )^2 ]

Simplify the terms:

(4k -1)/2 squared is ( (4k -1)^2 ) /4, so 1 over that is 4/(4k -1)^2. Similarly for the other term.

So:

= sqrt(2)/4 * 2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(2k)] [4/(4k -1)^2 -4/(4k +1)^2 ]

= sqrt(2)/2 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(2k)] *4 [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ]

= sqrt(2)/2 * 4/(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

= sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

Hmm, this seems like a more manageable sum, but still not obvious. Let me see if I can relate this to known series.

Alternatively, perhaps consider telescoping. The term [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] can be written as a difference. Let me write it as [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] = [ (4k +1)^2 - (4k -1)^2 ] / [ (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ]

The numerator: (16k^2 +8k +1) - (16k^2 -8k +1) = 16k.

So [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] = 16k / [ (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ]

Therefore, the term becomes:

sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k * 16k / ( (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ) ]

= sqrt(2) * 16 Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1 / [ (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ]

Hmm, so Integral = 16 sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1 / [ (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ]

This seems like a more compact form, but I'm not sure if this series can be summed in closed-form. Let me check if this series is known or can be related to some standard series.

Alternatively, perhaps partial fractions. Let me consider the denominator: (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2. Let me set m =4k, then denominator becomes (m -1)^2 (m +1)^2 = (m^2 -1)^2. So the term is 1/(m^2 -1)^2 where m =4k. So the sum is over k ≥1, m=4,8,12,...

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express 1/(m^2 -1)^2 as a derivative of 1/(m^2 -1). Let me recall that 1/(m^2 -1) = 1/2 [1/(m -1) -1/(m +1)]. Then differentiating both sides with respect to m:

d/dm [1/(m^2 -1)] = -2m/(m^2 -1)^2 = 1/2 [ -1/(m -1)^2 +1/(m +1)^2 ]

Therefore, 1/(m^2 -1)^2 = [1/(4m) ) [1/(m -1)^2 -1/(m +1)^2 ]

Wait, let me check:

From d/dm [1/(m^2 -1)] = -2m/(m^2 -1)^2.

But also, derivative of 1/(m^2 -1) is derivative of 1/2 [1/(m -1) -1/(m +1) ] which is 1/2 [ -1/(m -1)^2 +1/(m +1)^2 ]

Therefore:

-2m/(m^2 -1)^2 = 1/2 [ -1/(m -1)^2 +1/(m +1)^2 ]

Multiply both sides by -1/(2m):

1/(m^2 -1)^2 = 1/(4m) [1/(m -1)^2 -1/(m +1)^2 ]

Therefore, 1/(m^2 -1)^2 = 1/(4m) [1/(m -1)^2 -1/(m +1)^2 ]

So substituting back into the sum:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( ( (4k)^2 -1 )^2 ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (16k^2 -1 )^2 )

But using the identity above, with m=4k:

1/( (16k^2 -1 )^2 ) = 1/( (4k)^2 -1 )^2 = 1/(4*(4k)) [1/( (4k -1)^2 ) -1/( (4k +1)^2 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, m=4k, so 1/(m^2 -1)^2 =1/(4m) [1/(m -1)^2 -1/(m +1)^2 ]

But m=4k, so:

1/( (4k)^2 -1 )^2 =1/(4*(4k)) [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ]

Therefore, 1/( (16k^2 -1 )^2 ) =1/(16k) [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ]

But in our sum, we have:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (16k^2 -1 )^2 ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(16k) [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ]

But this seems to relate to the original term. Wait, but in our case, the sum is:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (16k^2 -1 )^2 ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(16k) [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

But this seems like a recursive relation. Let me substitute this into our expression for the integral:

Integral =16 sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (4k -1)^2 (4k +1)^2 ) =16 sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(16k) [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

=16 sqrt(2) * (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

= sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

Wait, but this brings us back to the previous expression. So this approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider generating functions or integral representations. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function or Dirichlet eta function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the original integral can be related to known integrals. Let me recall that integrals involving x^{a} ln x ln(1 -x) etc. can sometimes be expressed in terms of derivatives of the Beta function or Gamma function. But given the complexity of the integrand, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps consider numerical integration. But the problem asks for an analytical solution. So I must have missed a substitution or an identity that simplifies the integral.

Wait, going back to the original integral:

Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ u sinh u ln(tanh u) du

Let me consider integrating by parts. Let me set:

Let v = u, dv = du

dw = sinh u ln(tanh u) du

Then, w = ∫ sinh u ln(tanh u) du

But integrating dw is not straightforward. Alternatively, set:

Let me set t = tanh u. Then dt/du = sech^2 u = 1 - tanh^2 u = 1 - t^2. So du = dt/(1 - t^2)

Also, sinh u = t / sqrt(1 - t^2)

So the integral becomes:

2 sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ [ artanh t ] * [ t / sqrt(1 - t^2) ] * ln t * [ dt/(1 - t^2) ]

Wait, no. Wait, u = artanh t, so sinh u = t / sqrt(1 - t^2), and the original integral is:

2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^∞ u sinh u ln(tanh u) du

But with substitution t = tanh u, when u=0, t=0; u=∞, t=1. So:

Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ artanh t * (t / sqrt(1 - t^2)) * ln t * (dt / (1 - t^2))

Wait, artanh t = (1/2) ln[(1 + t)/(1 - t)]

So:

Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ [ (1/2) ln((1 + t)/(1 - t)) ] * [ t / sqrt(1 - t^2) ] * ln t * [ dt / (1 - t^2) ) ]

Simplify:

= sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ [ ln((1 + t)/(1 - t)) ] * t ln t / ( (1 - t^2)^(3/2) ) dt

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me set x = t^2. Then t = sqrt(x), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) dx. Then the integral becomes:

sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ [ ln( (1 + sqrt(x))/(1 - sqrt(x)) ) ] * sqrt(x) ln x / ( (1 - x)^(3/2) ) * (1/(2 sqrt(x))) dx

Simplify:

sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀¹ [ ln( (1 + sqrt(x))/(1 - sqrt(x)) ) ] * ln x / (1 - x)^(3/2) dx

= sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀¹ [ 2 artanh(sqrt(x)) ] * ln x / (1 - x)^(3/2) dx

Because ln( (1 + sqrt(x))/(1 - sqrt(x)) ) = 2 artanh(sqrt(x))

So:

= sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ artanh(sqrt(x)) * ln x / (1 - x)^(3/2) dx

Hmm, still not helpful. Maybe another substitution. Let me set y = sqrt(x), so x = y^2, dx = 2y dy. Then:

= sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ artanh(y) * ln(y^2) / (1 - y^2)^{3/2} * 2y dy

= 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ artanh(y) * (2 ln y) / (1 - y^2)^{3/2} * y dy

= 4 sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ y artanh(y) ln y / (1 - y^2)^{3/2} dy

This seems to be going in circles. Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Wait, going back to the original integral:

∫₀² x^(-3/2) ln(1 - 0.5x) ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] dx

Let me try a substitution inspired by the limits. Let me set x = 2 sin^2 θ. Then when x=0, θ=0; x=2, θ=π/2.

Then, dx = 4 sin θ cos θ dθ

x = 2 sin^2 θ, so sqrt(x) = sqrt(2) sin θ

sqrt(2 - x) = sqrt(2 - 2 sin^2 θ) = sqrt(2 cos^2 θ) = sqrt(2) cos θ

So the logarithm term:

ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] = ln[ (sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) cos θ)/ (sqrt(2) sin θ) ) ] = ln[ (1 + cos θ)/ sin θ ]

= ln( (2 cos^2(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = ln( cot(θ/2) )

= ln( cot(θ/2) )

Also, ln(1 - 0.5x) = ln(1 - sin^2 θ) = ln(cos^2 θ) = 2 ln cos θ

The integrand becomes:

x^(-3/2) * 2 ln cos θ * ln(cot(θ/2)) * dx

x^(-3/2) = (2 sin^2 θ)^(-3/2) = 2^(-3/2) sin^{-3} θ

dx = 4 sin θ cos θ dθ. Wait, no, dx = 2 sin(2θ) dθ. Wait, x = 2 sin^2 θ, so dx/dθ = 4 sin θ cos θ dθ. So dx = 4 sin θ cos θ dθ.

So putting it all together:

Integral = ∫₀^{π/2} [2^(-3/2) sin^{-3} θ] * [2 ln cos θ] * [ln(cot(θ/2))] * [4 sin θ cos θ dθ]

Simplify the constants:

2^(-3/2) * 2 * 4 = 2^(-3/2 +1 +2) = 2^(3/2) = 2 * sqrt(2)

The sin terms: sin^{-3} θ * sin θ = sin^{-2} θ

The cos terms: cos θ

So Integral = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ ln cos θ * ln(cot(θ/2)) ] * cos θ / sin^2 θ dθ

= 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ ln cos θ * ln(cot(θ/2)) ] * (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ

Hmm, cot(θ/2) = (1 + cos θ)/sin θ. So ln(cot(θ/2)) = ln(1 + cos θ) - ln sin θ.

So the integral becomes:

2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ [ ln(1 + cos θ) - ln sin θ ] (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ

= 2 sqrt(2) [ ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ ln(1 + cos θ) (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ - ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ ln sin θ (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ ]

This still looks very complicated, but maybe manageable. Let me consider substitution t = sin θ. For the first integral, let t = sin θ, then cos θ = sqrt(1 - t^2), dθ = dt / sqrt(1 - t^2). But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps substitution phi = π/2 - θ. But not sure.

Alternatively, consider expanding ln(1 + cos θ). Note that 1 + cos θ = 2 cos^2(θ/2), so ln(1 + cos θ) = ln 2 + 2 ln cos(θ/2). So:

First integral:

∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ [ ln 2 + 2 ln cos(θ/2) ] (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ

= ln 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ + 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ ln cos(θ/2) (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ

Similarly, the second integral:

- ∫₀^{π/2} ln cos θ ln sin θ (cos θ / sin^2 θ) dθ

This seems even more complex. Perhaps this substitution is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider integrating with respect to t = theta/2. Let me set phi = theta/2, so theta = 2 phi, d theta = 2 d phi. Then the limits become phi from 0 to pi/4.

But not sure. Alternatively, maybe another approach.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the integral, I suspect that this integral might be related to known constants or special functions. However, since the problem states to compute it analytically, there must be a way to express it in terms of elementary functions or well-known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiation under the integral sign. Let me consider introducing a parameter.

Let me define I(a) = ∫₀² x^{-3/2} ln(1 - a x) ln[(sqrt(2) + sqrt(2 - x))/sqrt(x)] dx

But the original integral is I(0.5). Maybe differentiating with respect to a and then integrating back. But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the original substitution we made, leading to the sum. If the sum can be evaluated, then we can get the exact answer. Let me try to compute the sum:

Integral = sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/k [1/(4k -1)^2 -1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

Let me write this as sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k (4k -1)^2 ) -1/(k (4k +1)^2 ) ]

This is a telescoping series? Let me check:

Let me write the term as:

1/(k (4k -1)^2 ) -1/(k (4k +1)^2 )

But it's not obvious how this telescopes. Alternatively, partial fractions.

Let me consider the term 1/(k (4k -1)^2 ). Let me decompose this into partial fractions.

Let me set:

1/(k (4k -1)^2 ) = A/k + B/(4k -1) + C/(4k -1)^2

Multiply both sides by k (4k -1)^2:

1 = A (4k -1)^2 + B k (4k -1) + C k

Expand A (16k^2 -8k +1) + B (4k^2 -k) + C k

= (16A +4B) k^2 + (-8A -B + C) k + A

Set coefficients equal:

For k^2: 16A +4B =0

For k: -8A -B + C =0

For constant term: A =1

So A=1. Then from 16*1 +4B=0 => B= -4

From -8*1 -(-4) + C=0 => -8 +4 +C=0 => C=4

Therefore:

1/(k (4k -1)^2 ) = 1/k -4/(4k -1) +4/(4k -1)^2

Similarly, for the term 1/(k (4k +1)^2 ):

Similarly, decompose:

1/(k (4k +1)^2 ) = D/k + E/(4k +1) + F/(4k +1)^2

Multiply both sides by k (4k +1)^2:

1 = D (4k +1)^2 + E k (4k +1) + F k

Expand D (16k^2 +8k +1) + E (4k^2 +k) + F k

= (16D +4E)k^2 + (8D +E +F)k + D

Set coefficients:

For k^2: 16D +4E =0

For k:8D +E +F=0

For constant: D=1

So D=1. Then 16*1 +4E=0 => E= -4

From 8*1 + (-4) +F=0 => 4 +F=0 => F= -4

Therefore:

1/(k (4k +1)^2 ) =1/k -4/(4k +1) -4/(4k +1)^2

Therefore, the term in the sum:

1/(k (4k -1)^2 ) -1/(k (4k +1)^2 ) = [1/k -4/(4k -1) +4/(4k -1)^2 ] - [1/k -4/(4k +1) -4/(4k +1)^2 ]

Simplify:

= [1/k -1/k] + [-4/(4k -1) +4/(4k +1) ] + [4/(4k -1)^2 +4/(4k +1)^2 ]

= 0 + 4[ -1/(4k -1) +1/(4k +1) ] +4[1/(4k -1)^2 +1/(4k +1)^2 ]

So the sum becomes:

sqrt(2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [4[ -1/(4k -1) +1/(4k +1) ] +4[1/(4k -1)^2 +1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

= 4 sqrt(2) [ - Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(4k -1) -1/(4k +1) ] + Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(4k -1)^2 +1/(4k +1)^2 ] ]

Let me compute each sum separately.

First sum: S1 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(4k -1) -1/(4k +1) ]

This is a telescoping series. Let's write out the terms:

For k=1: 1/3 -1/5

k=2: 1/7 -1/9

k=3: 1/11 -1/13

...

This is similar to the series for ln 2 or other constants. Let me recall that Σ_{n=0}^∞ [1/(4n +1) -1/(4n +3) ] = π/4. But our sum is different.

Alternatively, note that S1 can be written as Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(4k -1) -1/(4k +1) ] = (1/4) Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k -1/4) -1/(k +1/4) ]

This is a telescoping series for the digamma function. Recall that Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k + a) -1/(k + b) ] = ψ(b) - ψ(a), where ψ is the digamma function. But here, the sum is Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k -1/4) -1/(k +1/4) ] = [ψ(1 +1/4) - ψ(1 -1/4) ] = ψ(5/4) - ψ(3/4)

Using the properties of the digamma function, ψ(1 - z) - ψ(z) = π cot(π z). So ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4) = π cot(π/4) = π *1 = π. But our case is ψ(5/4) - ψ(3/4). Note that ψ(5/4) = ψ(1 +1/4) = ψ(1/4) + 4. Because ψ(z +1) = ψ(z) +1/z. So ψ(5/4) = ψ(1/4) + 1/(1/4) = ψ(1/4) +4.

Similarly, ψ(3/4) = ψ(-1/4 +1) = ψ(-1/4) +1/(-1/4). But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, using reflection formula:

ψ(1 - z) - ψ(z) = π cot(π z)

So ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4) = π cot(π/4) = π. But ψ(5/4) - ψ(3/4) = [ψ(1/4) +4] - ψ(3/4) = 4 - [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4)] = 4 - π.

Therefore, S1 = (1/4)(ψ(5/4) - ψ(3/4)) = (1/4)(4 - π) = 1 - π/4.

Wait, let me verify:

ψ(5/4) = ψ(1/4) + 4

ψ(3/4) = ψ(-1/4) + 1/(-1/4) + π cot(π*(-1/4))? Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me use known values.

The digamma function ψ(z) has known values at rational arguments. For example:

ψ(1/4) = -γ - π/2 - 3 ln 2

ψ(3/4) = -γ + π/2 - 3 ln 2

Therefore, ψ(5/4) = ψ(1/4) + 4 = (-γ - π/2 - 3 ln 2) +4

ψ(3/4) = -γ + π/2 - 3 ln 2

So ψ(5/4) - ψ(3/4) = [ -γ - π/2 -3 ln 2 +4 ] - [ -γ + π/2 -3 ln 2 ] = -π/2 -3 ln 2 +4 -π/2 +3 ln 2 = -π +4

Therefore, S1 = (1/4)(-π +4) = 1 - π/4.

So S1 = 1 - π/4.

Now, the second sum: S2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [1/(4k -1)^2 +1/(4k +1)^2 ]

This can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet eta function. Recall that Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n + a)^2 = ψ'(a), the trigamma function.

But more precisely, Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + a)^2 = ψ'(a). So for our case:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k -1)^2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4(k -1/4))^2 = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k -1/4)^2 = (1/16) [ ψ'(1 -1/4) ] = (1/16) ψ'(3/4)

Similarly, Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k +1)^2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4(k +1/4))^2 = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k +1/4)^2 = (1/16) [ ψ'(1 +1/4) - (1/(1/4)^2) ]

Wait, no. The trigamma function ψ'(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + z)^2. So:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k -1)^2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k -1/4)^2 = Σ_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4m + 3/4)^2 where m =k-1. So:

= (1/16) Σ_{m=0}^∞ 1/(m + 3/4/4)^2 = (1/16) ψ'(3/4/4)? Wait, no. Wait, 4k -1 =4(k -1/4), so 1/(4k -1)^2 =1/(16(k -1/4)^2). So Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k -1)^2 = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k -1/4)^2 = (1/16) Σ_{m=0}^∞ 1/(m + 3/4)^2 where m =k-1. So this is (1/16) ψ'(3/4).

Similarly, Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k +1)^2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4(k +1/4))^2 = (1/16) Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k +1/4)^2 = (1/16) [ ψ'(1/4) - (1/(1/4)^2) ]

Wait, ψ'(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + z)^2. So Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k +1/4)^2 = ψ'(1 +1/4) = ψ'(5/4). But ψ'(z +1) = ψ'(z) -1/z^2. So ψ'(5/4) = ψ'(1/4) -1/(1/4)^2 = ψ'(1/4) -16.

Therefore, Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k +1)^2 = (1/16) [ ψ'(5/4) ] = (1/16) [ ψ'(1/4) -16 ]

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, using known values of the trigamma function at rational arguments.

The trigamma function at 1/4 and 3/4 are known values:

ψ'(1/4) = π^2 + 8G, where G is Catalan's constant.

ψ'(3/4) = π^2 - 8G.

But I need to verify this. From literature, the trigamma function at 1/4 is ψ'(1/4) = π² + 8G, and ψ'(3/4) = π² - 8G, where G is Catalan's constant (approximately 0.9159655942).

Therefore, Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k -1)^2 = (1/16) ψ'(3/4) = (1/16)(π² -8G)

Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4k +1)^2 = (1/16) [ ψ'(1/4) -16 ] = (1/16)(π² +8G -16 )

Therefore, S2 = (1/16)(π² -8G) + (1/16)(π² +8G -16 ) = (1/16)(2π² -16 ) = (1/16)(2π² -16 ) = (π² -8)/8

So S2 = (π² -8)/8

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Integral =4 sqrt(2) [ -S1 + S2 ] =4 sqrt(2) [ - (1 - π/4) + (π² -8)/8 ]

Simplify:

=4 sqrt(2) [ -1 + π/4 + π²/8 -1 ]

=4 sqrt(2) [ -2 + π/4 + π²/8 ]

=4 sqrt(2) [ -2 + (2π + π²)/8 ]

=4 sqrt(2) [ (-16 +2π + π²)/8 ]

= (4 sqrt(2)/8) ( -16 +2π + π² )

= (sqrt(2)/2) ( π² +2π -16 )

So the exact answer is (sqrt(2)/2)(π² +2π -16 )

Simplify: sqrt(2)/2 = 1/√2, so:

= (π² +2π -16 ) / √2

Therefore, the exact answer is (π² + 2π -16)/√2.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute each term:

π² ≈9.8696044

2π ≈6.283185307

Sum: 9.8696044 +6.283185307 =16.152789707

Then subtract 16: 16.152789707 -16 =0.152789707

Divide by sqrt(2) ≈1.41421356237:

0.152789707 /1.41421356237 ≈0.107981933

So the numerical approximation is approximately 0.107981933, rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.1079819330.

But let me verify this calculation more precisely.

Compute π²: π ≈3.141592653589793, so π²≈9.869604401089358

2π≈6.283185307179586

Sum:9.869604401089358 +6.283185307179586=16.152789708268944

Subtract 16:0.152789708268944

Divide by sqrt(2):0.152789708268944 /1.4142135623730951≈0.1079819335301515

Rounded to 10 decimal places:0.1079819335

But let me check with higher precision.

Using more precise values:

π = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

π² = 9.869604401089358618834490999876151

2π =6.2831853071795864769252867665590058

Sum:9.869604401089358618834490999876151 +6.2831853071795864769252867665590058 =16.152789708268945095759777766435157

Subtract 16:0.152789708268945095759777766435157

Divide by sqrt(2)=1.4142135623730950488016887242097:

0.152789708268945095759777766435157 /1.4142135623730950488016887242097 ≈0.1079819335301514880014025674

So approximately 0.1079819335 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the exact answer is (π² +2π -16)/√2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1079819335.
