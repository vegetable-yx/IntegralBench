Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of sin(101x) times sin(x) raised to the 99th power. Hmm, that's ∫ sin(101x) sin^99(x) dx. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, integrating products of trigonometric functions often involves using trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. The exponents here are pretty high, especially sin^99(x), which seems daunting. But maybe there's a pattern or a recursive formula I can use. 

Wait, the integrand is sin(101x) multiplied by sin^99(x). I remember that when dealing with products of sine functions with different arguments, sometimes using product-to-sum identities can help. The product-to-sum formulas convert products of sines and cosines into sums, which might be easier to integrate term by term. 

But sin^99(x) is a high power. Maybe I can express sin^99(x) in terms of multiple angles using the Fourier series expansion or some kind of binomial expansion? Let me recall that sin^n(x) can be expanded using the binomial theorem with complex exponentials. For example, sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i), so raising that to the 99th power would give a sum of terms involving e^(ikx) where k ranges from -99 to 99 in steps of 2. Then multiplying by sin(101x), which is also a combination of exponentials, might lead to terms that can be integrated easily.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula for integrating sin^n(x) with another sine term. Let me think. The integral ∫ sin(mx) sin^n(x) dx. Maybe integration by parts? But with n=99, that would be tedious. 

Wait, maybe using orthogonality? If we expand sin^99(x) as a Fourier series, then multiplying by sin(101x) and integrating over a period would result in a non-zero term only if there's a component of sin(101x) in the expansion. But the interval here isn't specified. Wait, the problem says "definite integral" but doesn't specify the limits. Wait, hold on, the original problem is written as ∫ sin(101x) sin^99}(x) dx, but it's a definite integral. Wait, the user wrote "definite integral" but didn't specify the limits. Wait, maybe it's an indefinite integral? But the problem says "definite integral". Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check the original problem again.

The user wrote: "Please calculate the definite integral ∫sin(101x) sin^{99}(x) dx." But definite integrals require limits of integration. Since they didn't specify, maybe it's a typo, and they meant indefinite? Or perhaps the integral over a full period? For trigonometric functions, sometimes definite integrals over 0 to 2π or -π to π are considered. But the problem didn't specify. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the user intended it to be an indefinite integral but wrote definite. But the problem says "definite integral". Maybe the user expects the antiderivative? But the answer requires a numerical approximation, which would need specific limits. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the problem is actually an indefinite integral, but the user mistakenly called it definite. Alternatively, maybe the integral is over the entire real line, but that's not typical for trigonometric functions. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the integral from 0 to 2π, which is a common interval for sine functions. Let me check the problem again. The user says "definite integral" but didn't specify the limits. Hmm. Maybe I should assume the integral over a full period, which for sin(101x) and sin^99(x) would be 2π. Because sin^99(x) has a period 2π, and sin(101x) also has period 2π/101. So the least common multiple of 2π and 2π/101 is 2π, since 101 is an integer. Wait, no. The LCM of 2π and 2π/101 is 2π*(LCM of 1 and 1/101). But LCM of 1 and 1/101 is 1, since LCM is defined for integers. Wait, maybe the period of the product is 2π, because sin^99(x) has period 2π, and sin(101x) has period 2π/101. So the product would have a period equal to the LCM of 2π and 2π/101. The LCM of 2π and 2π/101 is 2π, since 2π/101 divides 2π. So the period is 2π. Therefore, integrating over 0 to 2π would cover a full period. But the problem didn't specify. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended an indefinite integral, but wrote definite. However, the problem says "definite integral", so perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the integral is from 0 to π? But without knowing the limits, it's impossible to compute a numerical value. Wait, but the user is asking for a numerical approximation. So maybe the integral is over a specific interval. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually indefinite, but then the numerical approximation wouldn't make sense. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the integral over 0 to 2π. Let me check standard integrals. For example, integrals of sin(nx) sin^m(x) over 0 to 2π. These often result in zero unless certain conditions are met. 

Wait, let's suppose the integral is from 0 to 2π. Then, using orthogonality, the integral of sin(101x) multiplied by a Fourier series expansion of sin^99(x). If sin^99(x) can be expressed as a sum of sine terms with different frequencies, then when multiplied by sin(101x), the integral over 0 to 2π would be non-zero only if one of the terms in the expansion has sin(101x). So the integral would be proportional to the coefficient of sin(101x) in the expansion of sin^99(x). 

So, first, I need to find the Fourier series expansion of sin^99(x). Let's recall that sin^n(x) can be written as a sum of multiple angles. For example, using the formula for sin^n(x) in terms of a sum of cos(kx) or sin(kx) depending on whether n is even or odd. Since 99 is odd, sin^99(x) can be written as a sum of sine terms. 

The general formula for sin^{2m+1}(x) is a sum of sin((2k+1)x) terms. Specifically, there's a formula that sin^n(x) = (1/2^{n-1}) * Σ_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k C(n, k) sin((n - 2k)x) for odd n=2m+1. Wait, let me check. 

Yes, for example, for sin^3(x) = (3 sin(x) - sin(3x))/4. Similarly, sin^5(x) = (10 sin(x) - 5 sin(3x) + sin(5x))/16. So the pattern is that sin^{2m+1}(x) can be expressed as a sum of sin((2k+1)x) terms with coefficients. 

Therefore, sin^99(x) would be a sum of sin((99 - 2k)x) terms for k from 0 to 49, each multiplied by certain coefficients. Then, when we multiply by sin(101x), the product would be sin(101x) * sin((99 - 2k)x). Then, integrating over 0 to 2π, the integral of sin(a x) sin(b x) dx from 0 to 2π is zero unless a = ±b, in which case it's π. 

Wait, more precisely, the integral over 0 to 2π of sin(mx) sin(nx) dx is 0 when m ≠ n, and π when m = n ≠ 0. So, if in the expansion of sin^99(x), there is a term with sin(101x), then the integral would be π times the coefficient of sin(101x) in the expansion. Otherwise, the integral would be zero. 

So, the key is to find the coefficient of sin(101x) in the expansion of sin^99(x). Let's see. Since sin^99(x) is expressed as a sum of sin((99 - 2k)x) terms, we need to check if 99 - 2k = 101 for some integer k. Solving 99 - 2k = 101 gives k = (99 - 101)/2 = -1. But k starts from 0, so there is no such k. Therefore, there is no sin(101x) term in the expansion of sin^99(x). Therefore, the integral over 0 to 2π of sin(101x) sin^99(x) dx is zero. 

But wait, let me confirm. The expansion of sin^99(x) would have terms like sin(99x), sin(97x), ..., sin(x). The highest frequency term is sin(99x), and the lowest is sin(x). So 101x is higher than 99x, so there's no term with sin(101x). Therefore, the integral over 0 to 2π would be zero. 

But the problem says "definite integral" without specifying the limits. If the user intended the integral over 0 to 2π, then the answer is zero. But if the integral is indefinite, then the antiderivative would be non-zero function. However, the problem also asks for a numerical approximation. If the integral is over 0 to 2π, the numerical approximation is zero. But if it's an indefinite integral, the numerical approximation would depend on the limits, which are not given. 

This is a problem. The user might have made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the integral is over all real numbers? But that's not a standard definite integral. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the integral from 0 to π. Let me check. If the integral is from 0 to π, then the same logic applies. The product sin(101x) sin^99(x) would integrate to zero if there's no matching frequency. But again, since sin^99(x) only has frequencies up to 99, and 101 is higher, the integral would still be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended the indefinite integral. Let's consider that. If it's an indefinite integral, then we need to find the antiderivative. But integrating sin(101x) sin^99(x) dx. That seems complicated. Let's see. 

But perhaps there's a recursive formula or a substitution. Let me think. Let's use the identity for sin(a) sin(b) = [cos(a - b) - cos(a + b)] / 2. So, sin(101x) sin^99(x) = sin^99(x) * sin(101x) = sin^99(x) * sin(101x). If we apply the product-to-sum identity once, we can only reduce the power by 1. But since the power is 99, that's not helpful. Alternatively, express sin^99(x) as sin^{98}(x) * sin(x), and use the product-to-sum formula on sin(x) * sin(101x). 

Wait, sin(x) * sin(101x) = [cos(100x) - cos(102x)] / 2. Then, sin^99(x) * sin(101x) = sin^{98}(x) * [cos(100x) - cos(102x)] / 2. Then, this becomes (1/2) [sin^{98}(x) cos(100x) - sin^{98}(x) cos(102x)]. 

But integrating this term by term. However, integrating sin^{98}(x) cos(100x) dx and sin^{98}(x) cos(102x) dx. These integrals might be expressible via recursion or some other identities. 

Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials. Let's express sin(101x) sin^99(x) in terms of exponentials. 

First, sin(101x) = (e^{i101x} - e^{-i101x}) / (2i). Similarly, sin^99(x) = [ (e^{ix} - e^{-ix}) / (2i) ]^99. 

Expanding this using the binomial theorem: 

sin^99(x) = (1/(2i)^99) Σ_{k=0}^{99} C(99, k) (-1)^{99 - k} e^{i(99 - 2k)x}. 

Therefore, sin(101x) sin^99(x) = [ (e^{i101x} - e^{-i101x}) / (2i) ] * [ (1/(2i)^99) Σ_{k=0}^{99} C(99, k) (-1)^{99 - k} e^{i(99 - 2k)x} ]

Multiplying these together:

= (1/(2i)^{100}) Σ_{k=0}^{99} C(99, k) (-1)^{99 - k} [e^{i101x} * e^{i(99 - 2k)x} - e^{-i101x} * e^{i(99 - 2k)x}]

Simplifying the exponents:

First term: e^{i(101x + 99x - 2k x)} = e^{i(200 - 2k)x}

Second term: e^{i(-101x + 99x - 2k x)} = e^{i(-2 - 2k)x}

Therefore, the product becomes:

(1/(2i)^{100}) Σ_{k=0}^{99} C(99, k) (-1)^{99 - k} [e^{i(200 - 2k)x} - e^{i(-2 - 2k)x}]

Now, integrating term by term. If we are integrating over a full period, say from 0 to 2π, then the integral of e^{i m x} dx over 0 to 2π is zero unless m=0, in which case it's 2π. 

But in our case, the exponents are (200 - 2k) and (-2 - 2k). For the integral over 0 to 2π to be non-zero, we need 200 - 2k = 0 or -2 - 2k = 0. 

For 200 - 2k = 0: k = 100. But k ranges from 0 to 99, so no solution here. 

For -2 - 2k = 0: k = -1. Again, k starts at 0, so no solution. 

Therefore, all terms integrate to zero. Hence, the integral over 0 to 2π is zero. 

But if the integral is indefinite, then each term would integrate to (1/(2i)^{100}) Σ ... [ (e^{i(200 - 2k)x}/(i(200 - 2k)) ) - (e^{i(-2 - 2k)x}/(i(-2 - 2k)) )) ] + C. But this would be a sum of exponentials, which can be converted back to trigonometric functions, but it's going to be a very complicated expression. 

But the problem says "definite integral" and asks for a numerical approximation. Since the user didn't specify the limits, but the integral over a full period is zero, perhaps the answer is zero. However, if the user intended a different interval, the answer could be different. But given the lack of specified limits, and the fact that the integral over 0 to 2π is zero, and that the problem mentions a numerical approximation, which would be zero, I think the intended answer is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the integral is indefinite, but then the numerical approximation wouldn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to be over 0 to 2π, and the answer is zero. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. 

But let me check again. Suppose the integral is from -∞ to ∞, but that's not a standard definite integral for periodic functions. Alternatively, maybe the user intended indefinite, but then the numerical answer is not possible. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the integral is over 0 to 2π, and the answer is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended the integral over another interval. For example, from 0 to π. Let's check. If the integral is from 0 to π, then the same logic applies. The product sin(101x) sin^99(x) would expand into terms with frequencies 200 - 2k and -2 - 2k, which are not zero, but integrating over 0 to π. However, the orthogonality over 0 to π is slightly different. For example, the integral of sin(nx) sin(mx) over 0 to π is 0 if m ≠ n and π/2 if m = n. But even so, unless there's a term with sin(101x) in the expansion of sin^99(x), which there isn't, the integral would still be zero. 

Therefore, regardless of the interval over a multiple of π, the integral would be zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. 

Hence, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.
