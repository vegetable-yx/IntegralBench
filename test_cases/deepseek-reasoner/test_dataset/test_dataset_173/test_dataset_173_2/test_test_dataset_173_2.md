Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt(1² - x²) times arcsin²(0.5x) dx. Let me start by writing that out clearly: ∫₀¹ √(1 - x²) [arcsin(x/2)]² dx. Hmm, this looks a bit tricky. Let me think about possible methods. Integration by parts might be useful here since we have a product of functions. The integrand is the product of sqrt(1 - x²) and [arcsin(x/2)]². 

Let me recall that integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. So I need to choose u and dv. Let me consider setting u = [arcsin(x/2)]², which would make du = 2 arcsin(x/2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (x/2)²)) * (1/2) dx. Simplifying that, du = [arcsin(x/2) / sqrt(1 - x²/4)] dx. Then dv would be sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Now, I need to find v by integrating dv. The integral of sqrt(1 - x²) dx is known; it's (x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) + (1/2) arcsin(x) + C. So v = (x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) + (1/2) arcsin(x). 

Applying integration by parts: uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. Let's compute uv term first. At x=1: arcsin(1/2) is π/6, so [arcsin(1/2)]² = (π/6)². Then v at x=1 is (1/2)(0) + (1/2)(π/2) = π/4. So uv at 1 is (π/6)² * π/4 = π³/(144). At x=0: arcsin(0)² is 0, and v is 0 as well. So the uv term is π³/144. 

Now the remaining integral is -∫₀¹ v du. Let's write that out: -∫₀¹ [(x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) + (1/2) arcsin(x)] * [arcsin(x/2) / sqrt(1 - x²/4)] dx. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me see if there's another way. 

Alternatively, maybe a substitution would help. Let me consider substituting t = x/2, so x = 2t, dx = 2dt. Then the limits when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=0.5. The integral becomes ∫₀^0.5 sqrt(1 - (2t)²) * [arcsin(t)]² * 2 dt. Simplify sqrt(1 - 4t²) * 2 [arcsin(t)]² dt. Hmm, sqrt(1 - 4t²) is similar to the sqrt(1 - (2t)^2), which is part of the integrand. But I'm not sure if this substitution helps. Maybe another substitution? Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps expanding [arcsin(x/2)]² into a series and integrating term by term. The Taylor series for arcsin(z) is z + (1/6)z³ + (3/40)z^5 + ... So [arcsin(z)]² would be z² + (1/3)z^4 + (8/45)z^6 + ... Let me check that. The square of the series: (z + z³/6 + 3z^5/40 + ...)^2 = z² + (2*(1/6))z^4 + (2*(3/40) + (1/6)^2)z^6 + ... which is z² + (1/3)z^4 + (3/20 + 1/36)z^6 + ... Hmm, maybe that's a way. Then substituting z = x/2, so [arcsin(x/2)]² = (x/2)^2 + (1/3)(x/2)^4 + ... Then multiply by sqrt(1 - x²) and integrate term by term. 

But integrating term by term might be tedious, but perhaps feasible. Let's try that. Let me write the integrand as sqrt(1 - x²) * [ (x/2)^2 + (1/3)(x/2)^4 + (8/45)(x/2)^6 + ... ] dx. Then the integral becomes the sum from n=0 to infinity of coefficients multiplied by ∫₀¹ x^{2n+2} sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Wait, but I need to find the coefficients of the series expansion of [arcsin(x/2)]². Let me check the expansion more carefully. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known series expansion for [arcsin(z)]². Let me recall that.

Yes, the series for [arcsin(z)]² is known. It can be written as (1/2)∑_{n=1}^∞ ( (2z)^{2n} ) / (n² * binomial(2n, n)) ). Let me verify that. For example, when z is small, [arcsin(z)]² ≈ z² + z^4/3 + 8z^6/45 + ... So the coefficients are 1, 1/3, 8/45, etc. So perhaps the general term is (2^{2n} z^{2n}) / (n² binomial(2n, n)) summed from n=1 to infinity. Wait, but when n=1: (4 z²)/(1² * 2) = 2 z², but the actual coefficient is 1. Hmm, maybe I need to check a reference. 

Alternatively, I can use the expansion from the integral. Let me recall that arcsin(z) = z + (1/6)z³ + (3/40)z^5 + (5/112)z^7 + ..., so squaring that:

[arcsin(z)]² = z² + (1/3)z^4 + (8/45)z^6 + (4/35)z^8 + ... 

So the coefficients are 1 for z², 1/3 for z^4, 8/45 for z^6, etc. So the general term might be ( (2n)! ) / ( (n!)^2 (2n + 1) ) ) * z^{2n + 2} }? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. 

Alternatively, maybe integrating term by term. Let's proceed with the first few terms. Let me write [arcsin(x/2)]² ≈ (x/2)^2 + (1/3)(x/2)^4 + (8/45)(x/2)^6 + ... Then multiply by sqrt(1 - x²) and integrate from 0 to 1. 

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ sqrt(1 - x²) [ (x²/4) + (x^4)/(3*16) + (8 x^6)/(45*64) + ... ] dx

Which is (1/4) ∫₀¹ x² sqrt(1 - x²) dx + (1/(48)) ∫₀¹ x^4 sqrt(1 - x²) dx + (8/(45*64)) ∫₀¹ x^6 sqrt(1 - x²) dx + ... 

Each of these integrals can be expressed in terms of the Beta function or Gamma function. Recall that ∫₀¹ x^{2n} sqrt(1 - x²) dx can be transformed by substitution t = x², so x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Then the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀¹ t^{n - 1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} dt = (1/2) B(n + 1/2, 3/2) = (1/2) [Γ(n + 1/2) Γ(3/2)] / Γ(n + 2). 

Using the properties of the Gamma function: Γ(n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n}) (2n)! ) / n! ), and Γ(3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2). So putting it all together:

(1/2) * [ (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / (2^{2n} n! ) ) * (sqrt(π)/2) ) ] / Γ(n + 2)

But Γ(n + 2) = (n + 1)! So simplifying:

(1/2) * [ π (2n)! ) / (2^{2n + 1} n! ) ) ] / (n + 1)! ) = π (2n)! ) / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^{2n} sqrt(1 - x²) dx = π (2n)! ) / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! )

So for each term in the series:

First term (n=1 in the original series? Wait, let's check. Wait, the expansion of [arcsin(z)]² is z² + (1/3)z^4 + (8/45)z^6 + ... So when we substitute z = x/2, the first term is (x/2)^2 = x²/4, which corresponds to n=1 in the series. Wait, maybe the general term is for [arcsin(z)]² = ∑_{k=1}^∞ a_k z^{2k}, where a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1/3, a_3 = 8/45, etc. So each term in the integrand is a_k (x/2)^{2k} multiplied by sqrt(1 - x²). Therefore, the integral becomes ∑_{k=1}^∞ a_k (1/2^{2k}) ∫₀¹ x^{2k} sqrt(1 - x²) dx. 

Using the formula above, each integral ∫₀¹ x^{2k} sqrt(1 - x²) dx = π (2k)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} k! (k + 1)! )

Therefore, each term in the series is a_k * (1/2^{2k}) * π (2k)! / (2^{2k + 2} k! (k + 1)! )) = a_k π (2k)! / (2^{4k + 2} k! (k + 1)! )

But we need to find the coefficients a_k. From the expansion of [arcsin(z)]², the coefficients a_k are known. Let me check a reference or derive them. 

The expansion of [arcsin(z)]² can be found using the series expansion of arcsin(z). Let me recall that arcsin(z) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) z^{2n + 1} }, so squaring this would give a Cauchy product. However, this might get complicated. Alternatively, there is a known formula for [arcsin(z)]² = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ ( (2z)^{2n} ) / (n^2 binomial(2n, n)) )

Let me verify this for the first few terms. For n=1: (2z)^2 / (1^2 * binomial(2,1)) ) = 4z² / (1 * 2) = 2z². Then multiplied by 1/2 gives z². For n=2: (2z)^4 / (2^2 * binomial(4,2)) ) = 16z^4 / (4 * 6) = 16z^4 /24 = (2/3)z^4. Multiply by 1/2 gives (1/3)z^4. For n=3: (2z)^6 / (3^2 * binomial(6,3)) ) = 64z^6 / (9 * 20) = 64/(180) z^6 = 16/45 z^6. Multiply by 1/2 gives 8/45 z^6. Which matches the coefficients we had earlier. So yes, the formula is [arcsin(z)]² = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ ( (2z)^{2n} ) / (n² binomial(2n, n)) )

Therefore, substituting z = x/2, we get [arcsin(x/2)]² = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ ( (2*(x/2))^{2n} ) / (n² binomial(2n, n)) ) = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ (x^{2n}) / (n² binomial(2n, n)) )

So the integrand becomes sqrt(1 - x²) * (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ x^{2n} / (n² binomial(2n, n)) )

Therefore, the integral is (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/(n² binomial(2n, n))] ∫₀¹ x^{2n} sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Using the earlier result for the integral ∫₀¹ x^{2n} sqrt(1 - x²) dx = π (2n)! / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! )

Substituting this into the series:

Integral = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/(n² binomial(2n, n))] * [π (2n)! / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! ) ]

Simplify binomial(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! n! ), so 1/binomial(2n, n) = (n! n! ) / (2n)! )

Therefore, substituting:

Integral = (1/2) ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ (n! n! ) / (2n)! ) * 1/n² ] * [ π (2n)! / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! ) ]

Simplify the terms:

The (2n)! cancels out. Then we have:

= (1/2) * π / 2^{2n + 2} * (n! n! ) / (n! (n + 1)! )) * 1/n²

Simplify n! / (n! (n + 1)! )) = 1 / (n + 1)! )

Wait, let's do it step by step:

After substituting:

= (1/2) * [ (n!²)/(2n)! ) * 1/n² ] * [ π (2n)! / (2^{2n + 2} n! (n + 1)! ) ]

Multiply the terms:

= (1/2) * π / (2^{2n + 2} n²) * (n!²) / (n! (n + 1)! )) 

Simplify n!² / (n! (n + 1)! )) = n! / (n + 1)! ) = 1/(n + 1)

So now:

= (1/2) * π / (2^{2n + 2} n²) * 1/(n + 1)

= π / (2^{2n + 3} n² (n + 1) )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

π / 2^3 ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2^{2n} n² (n + 1) )

Wait, 2^{2n + 3} = 8 * 4^n, so:

= π / 8) ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n² (n + 1) )

Hmm, so the integral is (π/8) ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n² (n + 1))

This series might be expressible in terms of known functions or constants. Let me see if I can find a closed-form for this sum. Let's denote S = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n² (n + 1))

We can split the term using partial fractions. Note that 1/(n²(n + 1)) = (1/n²) - (1/n(n + 1)). Let's verify:

1/(n²(n + 1)) = A/n² + B/n + C/(n + 1). Multiply both sides by n²(n + 1):

1 = A(n + 1) + Bn(n + 1) + Cn²

Let n = 0: 1 = A(1) => A = 1

Let n = -1: 1 = C(1) => C = 1

Now, equate coefficients for n²: B + C = 0 => B = -C = -1

Coefficient for n term: A + B = 0 => 1 + (-1) = 0, which holds. So yes, 1/(n²(n + 1)) = 1/n² - 1/(n(n + 1))

Therefore, S = ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/(4^n n²) - 1/(4^n n(n + 1))] = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n²) - ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n(n + 1))

Let's compute each sum separately.

First sum: S1 = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n²). This is known as the dilogarithm function evaluated at 1/4. The dilogarithm Li₂(z) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ z^n / n². So S1 = Li₂(1/4)

Second sum: S2 = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n(n + 1)). Let's manipulate this. Note that 1/(n(n + 1)) = 1/n - 1/(n + 1). Therefore, S2 = ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 1/(n + 1)] / 4^n = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) - ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1))

The first part is ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) = -ln(1 - 1/4) = -ln(3/4) = ln(4/3). The second sum is ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1)) = (1/4) ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^{n} (n + 1)) = (1/4) ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k - 1} k) ) = (1/4) [ ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4^{k - 1} k) - 1/(4^{0} 1) ) ] = (1/4)[4 ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4^k k) - 1] = (1/4)[4*(-ln(1 - 1/4)) -1] = (1/4)[4*ln(4/3) -1] = ln(4/3) - 1/4

Therefore, S2 = ln(4/3) - [ln(4/3) - 1/4] = ln(4/3) - ln(4/3) + 1/4 = 1/4

Wait, wait, let me check that again. Let me re-express S2:

S2 = ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/(4^n n) - 1/(4^n (n + 1))] = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) - ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1))

The first sum is S_a = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) = Li_1(1/4) = -ln(1 - 1/4) = ln(4/3)

The second sum S_b = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1)) = ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -1} k) ) where k = n + 1. So S_b = (1/4) ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -1} k) *4^{1} )? Wait, no. Let me substitute k = n + 1, so n = k -1. Then S_b = ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -1} k) = (1/4) ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -2} k) ) = (1/4) ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -2} k) ) = (1/4) ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^{m} (m + 2)) ) where m = k -2. So S_b = (1/4) ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^m (m + 2)) )

But ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^m (m + 2)) ) = 4^2 ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^{m + 2} (m + 2)) ) = 16 ∑_{m=2}^∞ 1/(4^m m) ) = 16 [ Li_1(1/4) - 1/4^1 /1 - 1/4^2 /2 ] = 16 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 - 1/(32) ]

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that ∑_{m=0}^∞ x^{m + 2}/(m + 2) ) = ∑_{k=2}^∞ x^k /k = -ln(1 - x) - x - x²/2. But here x = 1/4. So ∑_{m=0}^∞ (1/4)^{m}/(m + 2) ) = (1/4)^{-2} ∑_{k=2}^∞ (1/4)^k /k = 16 [ -ln(1 - 1/4) - (1/4) - (1/4)^2 /2 ] = 16 [ -ln(3/4) - 1/4 - 1/32 ] = 16 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 - 1/32 ]

Therefore, S_b = (1/4) * 16 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 - 1/32 ] = 4 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 - 1/32 ] = 4 ln(4/3) - 1 - 1/8 = 4 ln(4/3) - 9/8

Therefore, S2 = S_a - S_b = ln(4/3) - [4 ln(4/3) - 9/8] = ln(4/3) -4 ln(4/3) + 9/8 = -3 ln(4/3) + 9/8

Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. I must have made a mistake. Let me start over for S2.

S2 = ∑_{n=1}^∞ [1/(4^n n) - 1/(4^n (n + 1))] = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) - ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1))

First sum: S_a = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n) = -ln(1 - 1/4) = ln(4/3)

Second sum: S_b = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n (n + 1)) = ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -1} k) ) = (1/4) ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^{k -2} k) ) = (1/4) ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^m (m + 2)) ) where m = k -2.

Now, ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^m (m + 2)) ) = 4^2 ∑_{m=0}^∞ 1/(4^{m + 2} (m + 2)) ) = 16 ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(4^k k) ) = 16 [ ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/(4^k k) - 1/(4^1 1) ) ] = 16 [ -ln(1 - 1/4) - 1/4 ] = 16 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 ]

Therefore, S_b = (1/4) * 16 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 ] = 4 [ ln(4/3) - 1/4 ] = 4 ln(4/3) - 1

Therefore, S2 = S_a - S_b = ln(4/3) - (4 ln(4/3) -1 ) = ln(4/3) -4 ln(4/3) +1 = -3 ln(4/3) +1

So S = S1 - S2 = Li₂(1/4) - (-3 ln(4/3) +1 ) = Li₂(1/4) +3 ln(4/3) -1

Therefore, the integral is (π/8) S = (π/8)(Li₂(1/4) +3 ln(4/3) -1 )

Hmm, so the exact answer is expressed in terms of the dilogarithm function. But is there a way to express Li₂(1/4) in terms of elementary functions or more familiar constants? I don't think so. The dilogarithm at 1/4 is a known constant but doesn't have a simple closed-form expression. Therefore, the exact answer would have to be left in terms of Li₂(1/4). 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach to evaluate the original integral analytically without expanding into a series. Let me revisit the original integral: ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 - x²) [arcsin(x/2)]² dx. Perhaps a substitution like t = arcsin(x/2). Let me try that. Let t = arcsin(x/2), so x = 2 sin t, dx = 2 cos t dt. When x=0, t=0; x=1, t=arcsin(1/2)=π/6. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/6} sqrt(1 - (2 sin t)^2) * t² * 2 cos t dt. Simplify sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) * 2 cos t * t² dt. 

But sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) is sqrt(1 -4 sin² t). This complicates things because 1 -4 sin² t can be negative for some t. Wait, when t is between 0 and π/6, sin t is between 0 and 1/2, so 4 sin² t is between 0 and 1, so 1 -4 sin² t is between 0 and 1. So sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) is real and positive. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/6} sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) * 2 cos t * t² dt. 

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me set u = sin t, but not sure. Alternatively, express sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) as sqrt(1 - (2 sin t)^2) which is sqrt(1 - x²) where x = 2 sin t. Wait, but x here is 2 sin t, which is different from the original substitution. Not sure if this helps. 

Alternatively, perhaps express sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) in terms of cos(2t) or something. Let me recall that 1 -4 sin² t = 1 - 2*(2 sin² t) = 1 - 2*(1 - cos 2t) = 1 + 2 cos 2t. So sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) = sqrt(2 cos 2t -1). Hmm, but this might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe use a trigonometric identity for sqrt(1 -4 sin² t). Let me see. For example, if we write 1 -4 sin² t = cos(2t) - 2 sin² t. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of cos(3t) or another multiple angle. Not sure. 

Alternatively, consider expanding sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) as a series. For example, using the binomial expansion: sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) = sqrt(1 - a sin² t) where a=4. The expansion would be 1 - (1/2)(4 sin² t) - (1/8)(4 sin² t)^2 - (1/16)(4 sin² t)^3 - ... But this might not converge for all t in [0, π/6], but since 4 sin² t ≤ 4*(1/2)^2 = 1, so when t=π/6, sin t=1/2, so 4 sin² t=1. So at t=π/6, the expression becomes sqrt(0) =0. So the expansion would be valid for t in [0, π/6]. 

But integrating term by term might be complicated. Let me try:

sqrt(1 -4 sin² t) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ( (1/2 choose k) ) (4 sin² t)^k )

Where (1/2 choose k) is the binomial coefficient generalized to real numbers. The binomial coefficients for sqrt(1 - x) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose k) (-x)^k )

But this expansion is valid for |x| <1. Here, x=4 sin² t, which at t=π/6 is 1, so convergence at the upper limit is on the boundary. 

But proceeding, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/6} [ ∑_{k=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose k) (-4 sin² t)^k ) ] * 2 cos t * t² dt

= 2 ∑_{k=0}^∞ ( (1/2 choose k) (-4)^k ) ∫₀^{π/6} sin^{2k} t cos t t² dt

This seems even more complicated than the previous approach. Maybe this isn't helpful. 

Given that both approaches lead to infinite series involving special functions, perhaps the integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and must be left in terms of the dilogarithm function. Therefore, the exact answer is (π/8)(Li₂(1/4) +3 ln(4/3) -1 )

Now, to compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute this value. First, we need to find Li₂(1/4). The dilogarithm function Li₂(1/4) is approximately known. From known values, Li₂(1/4) ≈ 0.267399...

Alternatively, we can compute it numerically. Let's compute S1 = Li₂(1/4) ≈ sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n²). Let's compute the first few terms:

n=1: 1/(4*1²) = 0.25

n=2: 1/(16*4) = 1/64 ≈0.015625

n=3: 1/(64*9) ≈0.0017361111

n=4: 1/(256*16) ≈0.0002441406

n=5: 1/(1024*25) ≈0.0000390625

n=0.25 +0.015625=0.265625 +0.001736≈0.267361 +0.000244≈0.267605 +0.000039≈0.267644. The terms are getting small. Let's check n=6: 1/(4096*36)≈0.0.0000069. So adding up to n=5 gives ≈0.267644. The actual value of Li₂(1/4) is approximately 0.267399016... So the sum converges slowly. Alternatively, use known approximations or a calculator. 

But for the purpose of this problem, let's use the known value. Li₂(1/4) ≈ 0.267399016

Then, S = Li₂(1/4) +3 ln(4/3) -1 ≈ 0.267399016 +3*(0.287682072) -1 ≈ 0.267399 +0.863046 -1 ≈ 0.267399 +0.863046 =1.130445 -1=0.130445

Then the integral is (π/8)*0.130445 ≈ (3.1415926535/8)*0.130445 ≈0.3926990817 *0.130445≈0.051233

Wait, but this seems low. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, S = Li₂(1/4) +3 ln(4/3) -1. Let's compute each term:

Li₂(1/4) ≈0.267399016

3 ln(4/3) ≈3*0.287682072=0.863046216
