Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/4 of arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2] dx. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that integrating arctan functions can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a substitution or integration by parts that can help here. Let me start by writing down the integral:

∫₀^{π/4} arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2] dx

Hmm, the argument inside the arctan is (1 + tan x)/√2. Maybe I can simplify that expression first. Let me think about possible substitutions. If I let t = tan x, then dt/dx = sec²x, so dx = dt/(1 + t²). But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can be applied here. Let's see, the denominator is √2, which makes me think of angles related to π/4, since tan(π/4) = 1. Maybe there's a way to express (1 + tan x) in terms of a tangent addition formula. Wait, the formula for tan(A + B) is (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B). If I set B = π/4, then tan(π/4) = 1, so tan(x + π/4) = (tan x + 1)/(1 - tan x). But that's not exactly the same as the numerator here. Hmm, but maybe there's a way to relate (1 + tan x) to some angle addition. Alternatively, maybe I can consider a substitution where u = x + something. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts. Let me set u = arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2] and dv = dx. Then du would be the derivative of arctan, which is 1/(1 + [(1 + tan x)/√2]^2) times the derivative of the inside, and v = x. But integration by parts might lead to a more complicated integral. Let me try that.

So, let u = arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2], dv = dx. Then du = [1/(1 + ((1 + tan x)/√2)^2)] * [ (sec²x)/√2 ] dx, and v = x. Then integration by parts gives uv| from 0 to π/4 minus ∫v du. But this seems like it might not simplify easily. Let me compute du more carefully.

First, derivative of arctan(z) is 1/(1 + z²) * dz/dx. Here, z = (1 + tan x)/√2. So dz/dx = (sec²x)/√2. Therefore, du = [1/(1 + z²)] * (sec²x)/√2 dx. Let's compute 1 + z²:

1 + [(1 + tan x)/√2]^2 = 1 + (1 + 2 tan x + tan²x)/2 = (2 + 1 + 2 tan x + tan²x)/2 = (3 + 2 tan x + tan²x)/2. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of another substitution.

Wait, perhaps a substitution that can exploit the symmetry or some angle addition. Let me consider substituting x = π/4 - t. Let's try that. Let t = π/4 - x. Then when x = 0, t = π/4, and when x = π/4, t = 0. The integral becomes ∫_{π/4}^0 arctan[(1 + tan(π/4 - t))/√2] (-dt) = ∫₀^{π/4} arctan[(1 + tan(π/4 - t))/√2] dt.

Now, tan(π/4 - t) = (1 - tan t)/(1 + tan t). Let me verify that: tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B)/(1 + tan A tan B). So with A = π/4, tan A = 1, so tan(π/4 - t) = (1 - tan t)/(1 + tan t). Therefore, substituting back into the expression inside arctan:

[1 + (1 - tan t)/(1 + tan t)] / √2 = [ ( (1 + tan t) + (1 - tan t) ) / (1 + tan t) ] / √2 = [2 / (1 + tan t)] / √2 = 2/(√2 (1 + tan t)) = √2/(1 + tan t).

So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} arctan[√2/(1 + tan t)] dt. Hmm, interesting. So the original integral is equal to the integral from 0 to π/4 of arctan[√2/(1 + tan t)] dt. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then, after substitution, I = ∫₀^{π/4} arctan[√2/(1 + tan t)] dt. Now, if I add the original integral and this transformed integral, maybe something cancels or simplifies. Let's write:

I = ∫₀^{π/4} arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2] dx

and

I = ∫₀^{π/4} arctan[√2/(1 + tan t)] dt

But since the variable of integration is a dummy variable, we can write:

I + I = ∫₀^{π/4} [ arctan((1 + tan x)/√2) + arctan(√2/(1 + tan x)) ] dx

So 2I = ∫₀^{π/4} [ arctan(a) + arctan(1/a) ] dx, where a = (1 + tan x)/√2. But we know that arctan(a) + arctan(1/a) = π/2 for a > 0. Because arctan(a) + arctan(1/a) = π/2 when a > 0. Let me verify that. Let’s take θ = arctan(a), then tan θ = a, so arctan(1/a) = π/2 - θ. Therefore, their sum is π/2. So yes, that identity holds. Therefore, the integrand becomes π/2. Therefore, 2I = ∫₀^{π/4} π/2 dx = π/2 * (π/4 - 0) = π²/8. Therefore, 2I = π²/8, so I = π²/16. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, the substitution step: when I substituted x = π/4 - t, then dx = -dt, so the limits reverse, and the integral becomes from π/4 to 0, but then multiplied by -1, so it's from 0 to π/4. Then, after substitution, the integrand becomes arctan[√2/(1 + tan t)]. Then, adding the original integral and the transformed integral gives 2I = ∫₀^{π/4} π/2 dx. Therefore, 2I = π/2 * π/4 = π²/8. Therefore, I = π²/16. So the exact answer is π²/16. Let me check if that makes sense.

But let me verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute π²/16. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π² is about 9.8696044, divided by 16 gives approximately 0.616850275. Let me compute the integral numerically to check. Let's take x from 0 to π/4, compute arctan[(1 + tan x)/√2] and integrate numerically. Let's approximate using, say, the midpoint rule with a few intervals. Alternatively, use a calculator. But since I can't compute it here, but if the analytical result is π²/16 ≈ 0.616850275, then the numerical answer should be around that. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me check the key step again. The substitution x = π/4 - t, leading to the transformed integral. Then, the sum of the original integral and the transformed integral gives 2I = π²/8. Therefore, I = π²/16. That seems correct. Let me check with x = 0. When x = 0, the original integrand is arctan[(1 + 0)/√2] = arctan(1/√2) ≈ 0.615 radians. At x = π/4, tan x = 1, so the argument is (1 + 1)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2, so arctan(√2) ≈ 0.955 radians. The average of these two is around 0.785, but the integral over 0 to π/4 (which is about 0.785 radians) would be something like average value times interval length. If the exact answer is π²/16 ≈ 0.61685, that seems plausible. Let me compute π²/16 numerically: π² ≈ 9.8696, so 9.8696 / 16 ≈ 0.61685. Yes. So the exact answer is π²/16, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.616850275. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.6168502751.

Therefore, the final answer should be {"answer": "\frac{\pi^2}{16}", "numerical_answer": 0.6168502751}.
