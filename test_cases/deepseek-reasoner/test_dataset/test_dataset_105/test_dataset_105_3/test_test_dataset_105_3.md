Okay, let's tackle this integral: ∫₀² x arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) dx. Hmm, first, I need to compute this analytically. The integrand is x times the inverse sine of a square root function. The limits are from 0 to 2. Let me see... Maybe substitution will help here. 

The argument inside the arcsin is 0.5√(x(2−x)). Let me simplify that expression first. The square root part is √(x(2−x)). If I let x = 2 sin²θ, maybe that would simplify things. Because x(2−x) would become 2 sin²θ * (2 - 2 sin²θ) = 2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ. Then the square root of that would be 2 sinθ cosθ. So 0.5 times that is sinθ cosθ. Wait, but arcsin(sinθ cosθ)... Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution t = x - 1. That might center the interval around 0. But x goes from 0 to 2, so t would go from -1 to 1. Then x = t + 1, dx = dt. The expression under the square root becomes (t+1)(1 - t) = 1 - t². So √(1 - t²). Then 0.5√(1 - t²). So the arcsin of 0.5√(1 - t²). Hmm, not sure if that's better. Maybe.

Wait, let's try substitution u = x(2 - x). Then du/dx = 2 - 2x. Hmm, but integrating x arcsin(0.5√u) with du... Not sure. Maybe integration by parts? Since we have x multiplied by arcsin, which is a product. Integration by parts is a good approach here. Let me recall: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me set u_part = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) and dv_part = x dx. Then du would be the derivative of arcsin(...) times the derivative of the inside, and v would be (1/2)x². Wait, but maybe that's going to complicate things. Let me compute du_part first.

Wait, actually, let me switch the parts. Let me set u = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) and dv = x dx. Then du would be [1 / √(1 - (0.5√(x(2−x}))²)] * derivative of the inside. Let's compute that. The derivative of arcsin(z) is 1/√(1 - z²) * dz/dx. Here, z = 0.5√(x(2−x)). So z² = 0.25 x(2−x). Then 1 - z² = 1 - 0.25x(2−x). Let me compute that: 1 - 0.25(2x - x²) = 1 - 0.5x + 0.25x². Hmm, that's 0.25x² - 0.5x + 1. Maybe that can be written as (0.5x - 0.5)^2 + something? Let me check: 0.25x² - 0.5x + 1. Let's factor 0.25x² - 0.5x = 0.25(x² - 2x) = 0.25[(x - 1)^2 - 1]. So 0.25(x - 1)^2 - 0.25 + 1 = 0.25(x - 1)^2 + 0.75. So 1 - z² = 0.25(x - 1)^2 + 0.75. Hmm, not sure if that helps. 

But moving on, the inside derivative: dz/dx where z = 0.5√(x(2−x)). Let's compute that. Let me denote f(x) = x(2−x) = 2x - x². Then √f(x) is (2x - x²)^(1/2). The derivative of that is (1/2)(2x - x²)^(-1/2) * (2 - 2x). Then multiplied by 0.5, so dz/dx = 0.5 * [ (1/2)(2x - x²)^(-1/2) * (2 - 2x) ] = 0.25 * (2 - 2x) / √(2x - x²). Simplify numerator: 2(1 - x). So dz/dx = 0.25 * 2(1 - x)/√(2x - x²) = 0.5(1 - x)/√(2x - x²). 

Therefore, du = [1 / √(1 - z²)] * dz/dx dx. So putting it all together, du = [1 / √(1 - 0.25x(2−x))] * [0.5(1 - x)/√(x(2−x))] dx. Let me simplify the denominator: √(1 - 0.25x(2−x)) is √(1 - 0.5x + 0.25x²) as before. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, let's consider a trigonometric substitution. Let me set x = 2 sin²θ. Then when x=0, θ=0, and when x=2, θ=π/2. Let's try that. Then dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. The integrand becomes x arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) dx.

First, compute the argument of arcsin: 0.5√(x(2−x)) = 0.5√(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = 0.5 * √(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = 0.5 * 2 sinθ cosθ = sinθ cosθ. So arcsin(sinθ cosθ). Hmm, arcsin(sinθ cosθ). That's not straightforward. Maybe there's an identity here. Let's think. 

Wait, sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin(2θ). So arcsin((1/2) sin2θ). Hmm, not sure. Maybe we can express this in terms of another angle. Let me denote φ = arcsin((1/2) sin2θ). Then sinφ = (1/2) sin2θ. But I don't know if that helps. Maybe this substitution complicates things more. 

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me consider t = x - 1. Then x = t + 1, dx = dt, limits from t = -1 to t = 1. The integrand becomes (t + 1) arcsin(0.5√{(t + 1)(1 - t)}) = (t + 1) arcsin(0.5√(1 - t²)). Hmm, maybe that's better. The square root of 1 - t², so 0.5√(1 - t²). Let me set t = sinφ, so that √(1 - t²) = cosφ. Then 0.5 cosφ. So arcsin(0.5 cosφ). But t goes from -1 to 1, so φ from -π/2 to π/2. But x is from 0 to 2, so t from -1 to 1. Hmm, maybe this substitution is not helpful. 

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution u = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))). Let me set u = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))). Then sinu = 0.5√(x(2−x)). Squaring both sides: sin²u = 0.25 x(2−x). Multiply both sides by 4: 4 sin²u = x(2−x). So x² - 2x + 4 sin²u = 0. Hmm, solving for x in terms of u. Let's rearrange: x² - 2x + 4 sin²u = 0. Quadratic in x: x = [2 ± √(4 - 16 sin²u)] / 2 = [2 ± 2√(1 - 4 sin²u)] / 2 = 1 ± √(1 - 4 sin²u). Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts is the way to go. Let me proceed with that. Let me set u = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) and dv = x dx. Then du is the derivative as before, and v = (1/2)x². Then integration by parts gives:

∫ x arcsin(...) dx = (1/2)x² arcsin(...) | from 0 to 2 - ∫ (1/2)x² * [ derivative ] dx.

So let's compute the boundary term first. At x=2: arcsin(0.5√(2*0)) = arcsin(0) = 0. Similarly at x=0: arcsin(0) = 0. So the boundary term is (1/2)(4)(0) - (1/2)(0)(0) = 0. So the integral reduces to - (1/2) ∫ x² * [ derivative ] dx.

Now, we need to compute the derivative part. As before, the derivative of arcsin(z) is 1/√(1 - z²) * dz/dx. Let me recall z = 0.5√(x(2−x)). So z² = 0.25 x(2−x). Then 1 - z² = 1 - 0.25x(2−x) = 1 - 0.5x + 0.25x². Which is 0.25x² - 0.5x + 1. Let me write that as (0.5x - 0.5)^2 + 0.75. Wait, 0.25x² - 0.5x + 1 = 0.25(x² - 2x) + 1 = 0.25[(x - 2x + 1) -1] +1? Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, 0.25x² -0.5x +1 = (x² - 2x + 4)/4. Hmm, x² -2x +4 = (x -1)^2 +3. So 1 - z² = ( (x -1)^2 +3 ) /4. So sqrt(1 - z²) = sqrt( (x -1)^2 +3 ) /2. 

But the derivative dz/dx was computed earlier as 0.5(1 - x)/sqrt(x(2−x)). So putting it all together, the derivative is [1 / sqrt(1 - z²)] * dz/dx = [2 / sqrt( (x -1)^2 +3 )] * [0.5(1 - x)/sqrt(x(2−x))] = [ (1 - x) / sqrt( (x -1)^2 +3 ) * sqrt(x(2−x)) ) ].

So the integral becomes - (1/2) ∫₀² x² * [ (1 - x) / ( sqrt( (x -1)^2 +3 ) * sqrt(x(2−x)) ) ) ] dx. Hmm, this seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a substitution here. Let me see. Let me make a substitution t = x -1. Then x = t +1, dx = dt, limits from t = -1 to t=1. Then the integral becomes:

- (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} (t +1)^2 * ( -t ) / ( sqrt( t² +3 ) * sqrt( (t +1)(1 - t) ) ) dt.

Simplify numerator: (t +1)^2 * (-t). Denominator: sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²). So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt.

Hmm, this is still complicated, but maybe there's symmetry here. Let's check if the integrand is odd or even. Let's substitute t → -t. The numerator becomes (-t)(-t +1)^2. The denominator is sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²). So the integrand becomes (-t)(1 - t)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ].

Compare to original: t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ]. Not sure if there's symmetry. Let's expand the numerator:

t(t +1)^2 = t(t² + 2t +1) = t³ + 2t² + t. So the integrand is (t³ + 2t² + t) / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ].

Split into three terms:

t³ / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] + 2t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] + t / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ].

Now, let's check each term's parity. For the first term, replacing t by -t: (-t)^3 / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] = -t³ / [ ... ] which is odd. Similarly, the third term: (-t)/[...] is also odd. The second term is even. So when integrating from -1 to 1, the odd terms will cancel out, and the even term remains. So the integral becomes:

(1/2) [ 0 + 2 ∫_{-1}^{1} 2t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt + 0 ] = (1/2) * 2 * 2 ∫_{-1}^{1} t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt = 2 ∫_{0}^{1} t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt.

So now the integral simplifies to 2 ∫₀¹ t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt. Hmm, this is a bit better, but still not straightforward. Maybe another substitution. Let me try substituting t = sinφ, so that sqrt(1 - t²) = cosφ, dt = cosφ dφ. Then the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / [ sqrt(sin²φ +3) cosφ ] * cosφ dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ.

Simplify: 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ. Let me write sin²φ as (1 - cos2φ)/2. So:

2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ (1 - cos2φ)/2 ] / sqrt( (1 - cos2φ)/2 +3 ) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2φ) / sqrt( (1 - cos2φ)/2 +3 ) dφ.

Simplify the denominator: (1 - cos2φ)/2 +3 = (1 - cos2φ +6)/2 = (7 - cos2φ)/2. So sqrt( (7 - cos2φ)/2 ) = sqrt( (7 - cos2φ)/2 ). Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2φ) / sqrt( (7 - cos2φ)/2 ) dφ = sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2φ) / sqrt(7 - cos2φ) dφ.

Let me set θ = 2φ. Then when φ=0, θ=0; φ=π/2, θ=π. dθ = 2 dφ, so dφ = dθ/2. The integral becomes:

sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀^{π} (1 - cosθ) / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ = (sqrt(2)/2) ∫₀^{π} (1 - cosθ) / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ.

Let me write this as (sqrt(2)/2) ∫₀^{π} (1 - cosθ) (7 - cosθ)^{-1/2} dθ. Hmm, maybe another substitution. Let me set u = cosθ. Then du = -sinθ dθ. But the limits would be from u=1 to u=-1. Hmm, but the integrand is (1 - u)/sqrt(7 - u) * (-du/sinθ). But sinθ = sqrt(1 - u²). This might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps expand the numerator.

Let me write (1 - cosθ) = (7 - cosθ) -6. So:

(1 - cosθ) = (7 - cosθ) -6. Then the integral becomes:

(sqrt(2)/2) ∫₀^{π} [ (7 - cosθ) -6 ] / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ = (sqrt(2)/2) ∫₀^{π} sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ - 6 (sqrt(2)/2) ∫₀^{π} 1 / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ.

So, I = (sqrt(2)/2)(I1 - 6 I2), where I1 = ∫₀^{π} sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ and I2 = ∫₀^{π} 1 / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ.

These integrals I1 and I2 are standard forms involving elliptic integrals. Because integrals of the form ∫ sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ and ∫ 1/sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. Let me recall that.

For example, ∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ can be expressed using the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Similarly, the integral of 1/sqrt(a - b cosθ) is related to the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

Let me check the exact expressions. Let me recall that:

∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ = 2 sqrt(a + b) E( sqrt(2b/(a + b)) ) )

Wait, let me verify. The standard integral ∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ can be transformed by substituting θ = 2φ. Let me try that. Let θ = 2φ, so dθ = dθ/dφ dφ = 2 dφ. The limits become φ=0 to φ=π/2. Then:

∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cos2φ) * 2 dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(a - b (1 - 2 sin²φ)) dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt( (a - b) + 2b sin²φ ) dφ.

Which is 2 sqrt(a - b) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 + (2b)/(a - b) sin²φ ) dφ. Hmm, but this is similar to the form of the elliptic integral of the second kind. Wait, the elliptic integral of the second kind is E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - k² sin²φ) dφ. But here we have sqrt(1 + k² sin²φ). That's different. Maybe express in terms of hyperbolic functions? Alternatively, use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula. Let me check.

Alternatively, for the integral ∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ, using substitution t = θ/2, but I might need to look up the formula. Alternatively, use the identity.

Alternatively, let me consider a = 7, b =1 for I1. So I1 = ∫₀^{π} sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ. Let me write this as sqrt(7 - cosθ) = sqrt(7 + (-1) cosθ). So a =7, b=1. Then using the formula:

∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ = 2 sqrt(a + b) E( sqrt(2b/(a + b)) ) )

Wait, let me check with a reference. The integral ∫₀^{π} sqrt(a - b cosθ) dθ can be expressed as 2 sqrt(a + b) E( sqrt(2b/(a + b)) ). Let me verify this. Let me set k = sqrt(2b/(a + b)). Then the integral becomes 2 sqrt(a + b) E(k). Let me test with a=2, b=2. Then k = sqrt(4/4)=1, but E(1) is divergent? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, another approach. Let me use the substitution t = sin(θ/2). Let me try θ = π - 2φ. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, use the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2). Then sqrt(7 - cosθ) = sqrt(7 -1 + 2 sin²(θ/2)) = sqrt(6 + 2 sin²(θ/2)) = sqrt(2) sqrt(3 + sin²(θ/2)). Then the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π} sqrt(3 + sin²(θ/2)) dθ. Let me substitute φ = θ/2, so θ = 2φ, dθ = 2 dφ, limits from 0 to π/2. Then:

sqrt(2) * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(3 + sin²φ) dφ. This is 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(3 + sin²φ) dφ. Hmm, this is similar to the elliptic integral of the second kind but with a different form. The standard form is E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - k² sin²φ) dφ. To express our integral in terms of E(k), we can factor out the constant inside the square root.

sqrt(3 + sin²φ) = sqrt(3(1 + (1/3) sin²φ)) = sqrt(3) sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ). So the integral becomes 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ = 2 sqrt(6) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ.

But this is not directly a standard elliptic integral. However, there is a relation for integrals of the form ∫ sqrt(1 + k² sin²φ) dφ. Let me recall that ∫ sqrt(1 + k² sin²φ) dφ = sqrt(1 + k²) E( k / sqrt(1 + k²) ). Let me check:

Let’s set m = k², then ∫ sqrt(1 + m sin²φ) dφ = sqrt(1 + m) E( sqrt(m/(1 + m)) ). So in our case, m = 1/3. Therefore, the integral becomes sqrt(1 + 1/3) E( sqrt( (1/3)/(1 + 1/3) )) = sqrt(4/3) E( sqrt(1/4) ) = (2/√3) E(1/2). Therefore, the integral I1 is:

2 sqrt(6) * (2/√3) E(1/2) = 2 sqrt(6) * (2/√3) E(1/2) = 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2).

Similarly, for I2 = ∫₀^{π} 1 / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ. Let's apply the same substitution. Let θ = 2φ, then:

I2 = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(7 - (1 - 2 sin²φ)) dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(6 + 2 sin²φ) dφ = 2 / sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(3 + sin²φ) dφ = sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(3 + sin²φ) dφ.

Again, factor out 3: sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(3(1 + (1/3) sin²φ)) dφ = sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ.

This is sqrt(2/3) ∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ. Using the same approach as before, this is related to the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. The standard form is F(φ, k) = ∫₀^{φ} 1 / sqrt(1 - k² sin²θ) dθ. But here we have 1 + (1/3) sin²φ in the denominator. Let me write it as sqrt(1 - (-1/3) sin²φ). So k² = -1/3, but elliptic integrals are usually defined for real k between 0 and 1. Hmm, this might be problematic. Alternatively, use a different substitution.

Alternatively, express in terms of the elliptic integral of the first kind with imaginary modulus. But I need to check. Alternatively, use the identity:

∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(1 + k² sin²φ) dφ = 1/sqrt(1 + k²) K( k / sqrt(1 + k²) )

Let me verify this. Let’s set m = k². Then:

∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(1 + m sin²φ) dφ = 1/sqrt(1 + m) K( sqrt(m/(1 + m)) )

Yes, this is a standard identity. So in our case, m = 1/3. Therefore:

∫₀^{π/2} 1 / sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ = 1/sqrt(1 + 1/3) K( sqrt( (1/3)/(1 + 1/3) )) = 1/sqrt(4/3) K( sqrt(1/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2 K(1/2).

Therefore, I2 = sqrt(2/3) * sqrt(3)/2 K(1/2) = sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2).

Putting it all together, the original integral is:

(sqrt(2)/2)(I1 -6 I2) = (sqrt(2)/2)(4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) -6 * sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2)) = (sqrt(2)/2)(4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) -3 sqrt(2) K(1/2)).

Simplify:

sqrt(2)/2 * 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) = (4 * 2)/2 E(1/2) = 4 E(1/2).

Similarly, sqrt(2)/2 * (-3 sqrt(2) K(1/2)) = (-3 * 2)/2 K(1/2) = -3 K(1/2).

So the integral becomes 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2).

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is 4E(1/2) -3K(1/2), where E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind and K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

Now, we need to express this in terms of known constants. The values of K(1/2) and E(1/2) are known. Let me recall:

K(1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{1/4}) * Γ(1/4)^2 / (2 sqrt(2 π^{1/2})) )? Wait, maybe better to look up their numerical values.

From known tables:

K(1/2) ≈ 1.85407467730137191843385034720...

E(1/2) ≈ 1.35064388104767550252017473534...

So compute 4*E(1/2) -3*K(1/2):

4*1.3506438810476755 ≈ 5.402575524190702

3*1.8540746773013719 ≈ 5.562224031904116

Subtracting: 5.402575524190702 -5.562224031904116 ≈ -0.159648507713414

Wait, but this gives a negative value. However, the original integral is ∫₀² x arcsin(...) dx. Since arcsin(...) is non-negative in [0,2], and x is non-negative, the integral should be positive. So there must be a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's trace back. The integral after integration by parts was - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx. Then after substitution t = x -1, the integral became (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt. Then we split into terms and found that the integral of the even term was 2 ∫₀¹ t² / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt. Then after substitution t = sinφ, it became 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ. Then transformed into 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2). But according to the numerical calculation, this is negative, which contradicts the expectation. So there must be an error in the sign during the integration by parts.

Wait, let's check the integration by parts step. The original integration by parts was:

∫₀² x arcsin(...) dx = (1/2 x² arcsin(...))|₀² - ∫₀² (1/2 x²) * derivative dx.

But at x=2 and x=0, arcsin(...) is zero, so the boundary term is zero. Therefore, the integral is - (1/2) ∫₀² x² * derivative dx. So the integral is negative of that. But when we proceeded, after substitution, the integral became positive. Wait, when we did substitution t = x -1, the integral became (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt. But the original integral after integration by parts was - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx. So the negative sign is already included. Therefore, when we transformed the integral into the t variable, the expression already includes the negative sign. Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Original integral after integration by parts: - (1/2) ∫ x² * [ derivative ] dx. Then we did substitution t = x -1, which led to:

- (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} (t +1)^2 * [ (1 - (t +1)) / ( sqrt( (t)^2 +3 ) * sqrt( (t +1)(1 - t) ) ) ) ] dt.

Wait, x = t +1, so 1 - x = 1 - (t +1) = -t. So the numerator becomes (1 - x) = -t. Therefore, the integral becomes:

- (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} (t +1)^2 * (-t) / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt = (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) * sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt.

So the negative sign cancels with the -t, making the integral positive. Then we proceeded to split into terms, found that the integral reduces to 2 ∫₀¹ t² / [ ... ] dt, which after substitution became 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2). But according to the numerical calculation, this is negative. But the integral should be positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during the substitution or in the elliptic integrals.

Wait, let's check the numerical values again. If 4E(1/2) -3K(1/2) is negative, but the integral should be positive, then perhaps the sign is flipped. Let me recalculate:

E(1/2) ≈ 1.3506438810476755

K(1/2) ≈ 1.8540746773013719

4*1.3506438810476755 = 5.402575524190702

3*1.8540746773013719 = 5.562224031904116

5.402575524190702 -5.562224031904116 = -0.159648507713414

So negative. But the integral should be positive. Therefore, there's a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me trace back.

Wait, after integration by parts, the integral is - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx. Then after substitution, we arrived at (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ ... ] dt. Then split into terms and found that the integral is 2 ∫₀¹ t² / [ ... ] dt. Then after substitution t = sinφ, became 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ. Then transformed into 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2). But this gives negative. Therefore, the mistake must be in the substitution steps.

Wait, perhaps when we did the substitution θ = 2φ in the integral, we might have missed a sign. Let me check that part again.

Original integral after substitution t = sinφ: 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ. Then we wrote sin²φ = (1 - cos2φ)/2, leading to:

2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ (1 - cos2φ)/2 ] / sqrt( (1 - cos2φ)/2 +3 ) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos2φ) / sqrt( (7 - cos2φ)/2 ) dφ.

Then set θ = 2φ, leading to θ from 0 to π, dθ = 2 dφ, so integral becomes:

sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀^{π} (1 - cosθ) / sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ.

Then split into I1 and I2. But when we split (1 - cosθ) = (7 - cosθ) -6, the integral becomes:

sqrt(2)/2 [ ∫₀^{π} sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ -6 ∫₀^{π} 1/sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ ].

But this is sqrt(2)/2 (I1 -6 I2). Then we computed I1 and I2 as 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) and sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2), leading to:

sqrt(2)/2 (4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) -6 * sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2)) = sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2) (4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = (2)/2 (4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2).

But this is negative. However, the integral should be positive. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation of I1 and I2.

Wait, let's re-express I1 and I2. For I1 = ∫₀^{π} sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ. When we did substitution θ = 2φ, we got:

I1 = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(6 + 2 sin²φ) dφ = 2 sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(3 + sin²φ) dφ.

Then we expressed this as 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ. Then using the identity for ∫ sqrt(1 + m sin²φ) dφ = sqrt(1 + m) E( sqrt(m/(1 + m)) ), with m=1/3.

So sqrt(1 + 1/3) = 2/sqrt(3), and sqrt( (1/3)/(1 +1/3) ) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2. Therefore, I1 = 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) * (2/sqrt(3)) E(1/2) = 2 sqrt(2) * 2 E(1/2) = 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2). Wait, but sqrt(3) * (2/sqrt(3)) = 2. So yes, I1 = 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2). But wait, this seems incorrect. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ = sqrt(1 + 1/3) E( sqrt( (1/3)/(1 +1/3) ) ) = sqrt(4/3) E(1/2). Therefore, I1 = 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) * sqrt(4/3) E(1/2) = 2 sqrt(2) * sqrt(3) * (2/sqrt(3)) E(1/2) = 2 sqrt(2) * 2 E(1/2) = 4 sqrt(2) E(1/2). Wait, but sqrt(3) * sqrt(4/3) = sqrt(4) = 2. So yes, that's correct. So I1 =4 sqrt(2) E(1/2).

Similarly, for I2 = ∫₀^{π} 1/sqrt(7 - cosθ) dθ. After substitution, we had I2 = sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) ∫₀^{π/2} 1/sqrt(1 + (1/3) sin²φ) dφ. Then using the identity ∫₀^{π/2} 1/sqrt(1 + m sin²φ) dφ = 1/sqrt(1 + m) K( sqrt(m/(1 + m)) ), with m=1/3. So this becomes 1/sqrt(4/3) K(1/2) = sqrt(3)/2 K(1/2). Therefore, I2 = sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)/2 K(1/2) = sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2).

Therefore, the integral is sqrt(2)/2 (I1 -6 I2) = sqrt(2)/2 (4 sqrt(2) E(1/2) -6 * sqrt(2)/2 K(1/2)) = sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2) (4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = (2)/2 (4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2). So the calculation is correct, but the result is negative. But the integral should be positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during the integration by parts or substitution.

Wait, let's go back to the integration by parts. The original integral is ∫₀² x arcsin(...) dx. After integration by parts, it's equal to - (1/2) ∫₀² x² * derivative dx. The derivative term is [ (1 - x) / ( sqrt( (x -1)^2 +3 ) * sqrt(x(2−x)) ) ) ]. But when x is between 0 and 2, the denominator is always positive, and the numerator is (1 - x). So when x <1, numerator is positive, when x >1, numerator is negative. So the integrand is negative for x >1 and positive for x <1. Therefore, the integral over [0,2] would be the sum of positive and negative parts. But the original integral is positive, so the result after integration by parts must be positive. But according to the calculation, it's negative. Therefore, there must be a sign error.

Wait, the integral after integration by parts is - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx. If the integral of x² * derivative is negative, then the whole expression would be positive. But according to our calculation, the integral of x² * derivative is positive, leading to the result being negative. Therefore, the mistake must be in the calculation of the integral of x² * derivative.

But how? Let me check the derivative again. The derivative of arcsin(z) is 1/sqrt(1 - z²) * dz/dx. We computed dz/dx as 0.5(1 - x)/sqrt(x(2−x)). Therefore, the derivative is [1/sqrt(1 - z²)] * 0.5(1 - x)/sqrt(x(2−x)). But 1 - z² = 1 - 0.25x(2−x) = 0.25x² -0.5x +1. So sqrt(1 - z²) = sqrt(0.25x² -0.5x +1). Therefore, the derivative is [0.5(1 - x)] / [ sqrt(0.25x² -0.5x +1) * sqrt(x(2−x)) ].

But x(2−x) = 2x -x². So sqrt(x(2−x)) = sqrt(2x -x²). Therefore, the denominator is sqrt(0.25x² -0.5x +1) * sqrt(2x -x²). Let me check if this is positive. For x in [0,2], 2x -x² is non-negative, so sqrt(2x -x²) is real. The other term, 0.25x² -0.5x +1, is a quadratic with discriminant (0.5)^2 -4*0.25*1 = 0.25 -1 = -0.75, so it's always positive. Therefore, the denominator is always positive. The numerator is 0.5(1 -x). So the derivative is positive when x <1 and negative when x >1. Therefore, the integrand x² * derivative is positive when x <1 and negative when x >1. Therefore, the integral over [0,2] is the sum of positive area from 0 to1 and negative area from1 to2. Depending on which part is larger, the integral could be positive or negative. But according to the numerical calculation, it's negative. But the original integral is positive. So this suggests that the integration by parts approach might have an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the substitution steps leading to the elliptic integrals. Alternatively, maybe the integral is indeed negative, but that contradicts the original integral being positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution steps have an error. Let me check the substitution when we set t = x -1. The integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{-1}^{1} t(t +1)^2 / [ sqrt(t² +3) sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt. Then splitting into terms, we found that the integral reduces to 2 ∫₀¹ t² / [ ... ] dt. But when we did the substitution t = sinφ, the integral became 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²φ / sqrt(sin²φ +3) dφ. This integral is positive, so the result should be positive. But according to the elliptic integral calculation, it's negative. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the elliptic integral evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps the expressions for I1 and I2 are incorrect. Let me check the numerical values again. Let's compute 4E(1/2) -3K(1/2) with more precise values.

From Wolfram Alpha:

E(1/2) ≈ 1.35064388104767550252017473534...

K(1/2) ≈ 1.85407467730137191843385034720...

So 4*1.3506438810476755 ≈ 5.402575524190702

3*1.8540746773013719 ≈ 5.562224031904116

5.402575524190702 -5.562224031904116 ≈ -0.159648507713414

So the result is approximately -0.1596. But the original integral should be positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during the integration by parts. Let me check the integration by parts again.

The original integral is ∫₀² x arcsin(...) dx. Integration by parts: u = arcsin(...), dv = x dx. Then du = derivative dx, v = x²/2. Then ∫ u dv = uv|₀² - ∫ v du. The boundary term is zero, so the integral is - ∫₀² v du. So the integral is - (1/2) ∫₀² x² du. But du is the derivative, which is [1/sqrt(1 - z²)] * dz/dx. But dz/dx is 0.5(1 -x)/sqrt(x(2−x)). So du is positive when x <1 and negative when x >1. Therefore, the integrand x² du is positive when x <1 and negative when x >1. The integral from 0 to2 is the sum of the positive area from 0 to1 and negative area from1 to2. If the negative area is larger, the integral would be negative. But the original integral is positive. Therefore, this suggests that the integration by parts approach is incorrect.

But the original integrand x arcsin(...) is always positive, so the integral should be positive. Therefore, the mistake must be in the integration by parts process. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution steps introduced a sign error.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is indeed negative, but that contradicts the original integral being positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is correct, and the negative sign is due to the integration by parts, but the original integral is positive, so the negative of the calculated result is the correct answer. Let me check.

If the integral after integration by parts is - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx = - (1/2) * (negative number) = positive number. But according to our calculation, the integral of x² * derivative is negative, so the integral is - (1/2) * (negative) = positive. But according to our calculation, the integral of x² * derivative is 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2) ≈ -0.1596, so the integral is - (1/2) * (-0.1596) ≈ 0.0798. Wait, but according to our previous steps, the integral after integration by parts is equal to 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2), which is negative. But that would mean that the original integral is equal to that negative value, which contradicts the original integral being positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during the substitution steps.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The original integral is ∫₀² x arcsin(...) dx = - (1/2) ∫ x² * derivative dx. But according to our calculation, the integral ∫ x² * derivative dx = 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2) ≈ -0.1596. Therefore, the original integral is - (1/2) * (-0.1596) ≈ 0.0798. But according to our previous steps, we said that the integral after substitution is 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2), but that's actually the ∫ x² * derivative dx. Therefore, the original integral is - (1/2) * (4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = -2 E(1/2) + 1.5 K(1/2). Let me compute this:

-2*1.3506438810476755 +1.5*1.8540746773013719 ≈ -2.701287762095351 + 2.781112015952058 ≈ 0.079824253856707.

Ah! So the original integral is approximately 0.0798, which is positive. Therefore, the mistake was in the previous step where I thought the integral after substitution was equal to 4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2). But actually, that was the value of ∫ x² * derivative dx. Therefore, the original integral is - (1/2) times that, which is - (1/2)(4 E(1/2) -3 K(1/2)) = -2 E(1/2) + (3/2) K(1/2). Which is approximately 0.0798. Therefore, the exact answer is (3/2) K(1/2) -2 E(1/2).

But let's verify this. Let me compute (3/2) K(1/2) -2 E(1/2):

(3/2)*1.8540746773013719 ≈ 2.781112015952058

2*1.3506438810476755 ≈ 2.701287762095351

Subtracting: 2.781112015952058 -2.701287762095351 ≈ 0.079824253856707.

Yes, so the exact answer is (3/2) K(1/2) -2 E(1/2). Therefore, the exact analytical answer is (3/2) K(1/2) -2 E(1/2). 

But how to express this in terms of known constants? Alternatively, perhaps there's a simplification. Let me check if this combination of elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of π or other constants. Alternatively, it's possible that this is the simplest form.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can evaluate the integral without resorting to elliptic integrals. Let me think differently.

Let me go back to the original integral: ∫₀² x arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) dx. Let me consider a substitution inspired by the argument of the arcsin. Let me set y = 0.5√(x(2−x)). Then y = 0.5√(2x -x²). Squaring both sides: y² = 0.25(2x -x²) => 4y² = 2x -x² => x² -2x +4y² =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± √(4 -16y²)]/2 = 1 ± √(1 -4y²). But since x is between 0 and2, and y is between 0 and 0.5√(2*1 -1²)=0.5*1=0.5. So y ∈ [0,0.5]. Therefore, x =1 ± √(1 -4y²). But when x=0, y=0.5√(0)=0, and when x=2, y=0.5√(0)=0. So the substitution might be complicated. Alternatively, consider parametric equations.

Alternatively, let me consider a substitution t = arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))). Let t = arcsin(y), where y=0.5√(x(2−x)). Then y = sin t, so 0.5√(x(2−x)) = sin t. Squaring: 0.25x(2−x) = sin²t. Multiply by 4: x(2−x) =4 sin²t. So x² -2x +4 sin²t =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± √(4 -16 sin²t)]/2 =1 ± √(1 -4 sin²t). But x must be between 0 and2, so we need 1 -4 sin²t ≥0 => sin²t ≤1/4 => |sint| ≤1/2 => t ∈ [-π/6, π/6]. But since t is arcsin of a non-negative value, t ∈ [0, π/6]. Therefore, x =1 ± cos(2t), since √(1 -4 sin²t) = √(1 -2(2 sin²t)) = √(1 -2 sin²t) = cos(2t). Wait, no. Let me check:

Wait, 1 -4 sin²t = 1 -2*(2 sin²t) = cos(2t) -1. Wait, no. Let me compute:

cos(2t) =1 -2 sin²t. So 1 -4 sin²t = 2 cos(2t) -1. Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, let me compute:

√(1 -4 sin²t) = √(1 - (2 sint)^2). Let me set u = 2 sint. Then √(1 -u²). But this is cos(arcsin(u)) = cosφ where φ = arcsin(u). But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of cos(2t). Let me see:

1 -4 sin²t = 1 -2*(2 sin²t) = 1 -2*(1 - cos2t) = 1 -2 +2 cos2t = -1 +2 cos2t. So √(1 -4 sin²t) = √(2 cos2t -1). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps this substitution is not leading anywhere. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the integral is symmetric around x=1. Let me check if the integrand is symmetric. Let x =2 - t. Then when x=0, t=2; x=2, t=0. The integrand becomes (2 -t) arcsin(0.5√{(2 -t)(t)}). Which is (2 -t) arcsin(0.5√(t(2 -t))). Which is not the same as the original integrand x arcsin(...). So the function is not symmetric. Therefore, symmetry doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps expand the arcsin in a power series and integrate term by term. Let me consider the Taylor series expansion of arcsin(z). The Taylor series for arcsin(z) around z=0 is z + (1/6) z³ + (3/40) z^5 + ... . But in our case, z=0.5√(x(2−x)). The maximum value of x(2−x) is 1 at x=1, so z=0.5*1=0.5. So the maximum z is 0.5. Therefore, the series converges for |z| ≤0.5. So we can expand arcsin(z) as a power series.

Let me write arcsin(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)) ) z^{2n +1} }. For |z| ≤1. So arcsin(0.5√(x(2−x))) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)) ] (0.5)^{2n +1} (x(2−x))^{n +0.5} }.

Then the integral becomes ∫₀² x * Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)) ] (0.5)^{2n +1} (x(2−x))^{n +0.5} dx.

Interchange summation and integral (if valid):

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)) ] (0.5)^{2n +1} ∫₀² x^{1} (x(2−x))^{n +0.5} dx.

Simplify the integrand: x^{1} (x(2−x))^{n +0.5} = x^{1} x^{n +0.5} (2−x)^{n +0.5} = x^{n +1.5} (2−x)^{n +0.5}.

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1)) ] (0.5)^{2n +1} ∫₀² x^{n +1.5} (2−x)^{n +0.5} dx.

This integral can be expressed in terms of the Beta function. Let me make a substitution t = x/2, so x=2t, dx=2dt, limits from t=0 to t=1. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (2t)^{n +1.5} (2 -2t)^{n +0.5} *2 dt = 2^{n +1.5} * 2^{n +0.5} *2 ∫₀¹ t^{n +1.5} (1 -t)^{n +0.5} dt.

Simplify the exponents:

2^{n +1.5 +n +0.5 +1} = 2^{2n +3}. The integral is 2^{2n +3} ∫₀¹ t^{n +1.5} (1 -t)^{n +0.5} dt.

The integral ∫₀¹ t^{c-1} (1 -t)^{d-1} dt = B(c,d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c +d). Here, c =n +2.5, d =n +1.5. Therefore, the integral is Γ(n +2.5)Γ(n +1.5)/Γ(2n +4).

But Γ(n +2.5) = (n +1.5)(n +0.5)...(0.5) sqrt(π) by the property of the Gamma function. Similarly for Γ(n +1.5). However, this might get complicated, but perhaps there's a simplification.

Alternatively, using the duplication formula or properties of the Beta function. However, this seems quite involved and may not lead to a closed-form expression. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful for finding an exact analytical solution, but it could be used for numerical approximation.

Given that the integral reduces to (3/2) K(1/2) -2 E(1/2), which is approximately 0.079824253856707, and this is the exact analytical answer in terms of elliptic integrals, we can present this as the exact answer. However, the problem asks for the exact answer in LaTeX. The complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind with modulus 1/2 are standard functions, so the exact answer is:

\frac{3}{2} K\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 2 E\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)

But sometimes, the elliptic integrals are written with the parameter k or the modulus k. In some conventions, K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus k, and E(k) is the second kind. Therefore, this is the exact answer.

For the numerical approximation, we have approximately 0.079824253856707, which rounds to 0.0798242539 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the final answer is:
