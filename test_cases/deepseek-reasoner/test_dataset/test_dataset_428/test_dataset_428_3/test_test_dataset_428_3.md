Okay, so I need to calculate the definite integral of (x² + 1) with respect to the floor of x from 0 to 3. Hmm, integrating with respect to the floor function, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. I remember that integrals with respect to d⌊x⌋ are related to sums because the floor function is a step function. Let me think.

First, the integral ∫₀³ (x² + 1) d⌊x⌋. Since ⌊x⌋ is constant on intervals [n, n+1) for integers n, its differential d⌊x⌋ is zero there and has Dirac delta masses at each integer. So the integral becomes a sum over the jump points of ⌊x⌋ within [0,3). The jumps occur at x=1, x=2, and x=3? Wait, but the upper limit is 3. So the interval is from 0 to 3. The floor function jumps at each integer 1, 2, and 3. But wait, at x=3, the integral is up to 3 inclusive. So does x=3 count? Let me check.

In the definition of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, if the integrator has a jump at the upper limit, it's included. So if the integral is from 0 to 3, then the point x=3 is included. So the jumps are at 1, 2, and 3. Each jump has a height of 1, since the floor function increases by 1 at each integer.

Therefore, the integral becomes the sum of the integrand evaluated at each jump point multiplied by the jump size. Since the jump size is 1 at each integer, the integral is just the sum of (x² + 1) evaluated at x=1, x=2, and x=3.

Wait, but let me confirm. For Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, when the integrator is a step function, the integral is the sum of the function evaluated at the points of discontinuity multiplied by the jump size. So yes, in this case, the integrator is ⌊x⌋, which jumps by 1 at each integer. So the integral from 0 to 3 would be the sum over x=1, 2, 3 of (x² +1)*1. But wait, x=3 is the upper limit. Is x=3 included?

In the definition, if the integral is over [a, b], then the points of discontinuity in (a, b] are included. So if the interval is [0,3], then the points 1, 2, 3 are included. But wait, x=0 is also a point where the floor function is 0, but does it jump at 0? At x=0, the floor function is 0, and for x approaching 0 from the right, it's still 0. So the first jump is at x=1. So the jumps are at 1, 2, 3. So the integral is the sum of the integrand at 1, 2, 3 multiplied by the jump size, which is 1 each.

Therefore, the integral is (1² +1) + (2² +1) + (3² +1) = (1 +1) + (4 +1) + (9 +1) = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's take a step-by-step approach. The Riemann-Stieltjes integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dg(x) when g is a step function with jumps at points c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ in [a, b] with corresponding jumps Δg(cᵢ) is equal to the sum over i of f(cᵢ) * Δg(cᵢ). Here, g(x) = ⌊x⌋, which has jumps at each integer. In the interval [0, 3], the integers are 1, 2, 3. Wait, but 3 is the upper limit. So if the integral is from 0 to 3, inclusive, then the jump at 3 is included. The jump at 0 would be if we were integrating from a lower limit less than 0, but here it's starting at 0. So the jumps are at 1, 2, 3. Each jump is +1. So the integral is f(1) + f(2) + f(3). Since f(x) = x² +1, then:

f(1) = 1 +1 = 2

f(2) = 4 +1 = 5

f(3) = 9 +1 = 10

Sum: 2 +5 +10 = 17. So the exact answer is 17. The numerical approximation is 17.0000000000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the integral is from 0 to 3. The floor function is 0 on [0,1), 1 on [1,2), 2 on [2,3), and 3 at x=3. So the jumps occur at 1, 2, 3. The jump at 1 is from 0 to 1, so Δg(1) =1. Similarly at 2, Δg(2)=1, and at 3, Δg(3)=1. So the integral is sum_{c=1,2,3} f(c) * 1. So yes, 2 +5 +10=17. So the exact answer is 17, and numerically it's 17.0. So the JSON should be {"answer": "17", "numerical_answer": "17.0000000000"}.

Wait, but maybe I need to check if the integral is defined as including the upper limit. For Riemann-Stieltjes, if the integrator is right-continuous, which the floor function is, then the integral includes the jump at the upper endpoint. So yes, x=3 is included. Therefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is 17.
