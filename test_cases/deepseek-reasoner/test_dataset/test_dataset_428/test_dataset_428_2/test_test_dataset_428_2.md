Okay, so I need to calculate the definite integral from 0 to 3 of (x² + 1) d⌊x⌋. Hmm, right, this is an integral with respect to the floor function, which is a step function. I remember that integrating with respect to a step function like the floor function involves summing the function at the points where the floor function jumps, multiplied by the jump size. Let me recall. The integral ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dg(x) for a function g that has jumps at points x_i with sizes Δg(x_i) is the sum of f(x_i) * Δg(x_i) over all jumps in [a, b). 

So first, I need to identify where the floor function ⌊x⌋ has jumps between 0 and 3. The floor function jumps at each integer. So in the interval [0, 3), the jumps occur at x = 1, 2, and 3? Wait, but the upper limit is 3. Since the integral is from 0 to 3, I need to check if the endpoint is included. For Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, if the integrator is right-continuous, which the floor function is, then the integral from a to b includes the jump at b if there is one. But ⌊x⌋ at x=3 is exactly 3, and the jump at 3 would be from the left limit 2 to 3. But since the integral is up to 3, I think we include the jump at 3. Wait, but actually, the floor function is constant on [n, n+1) for each integer n. So at x=1, the floor function jumps from 0 to 1, at x=2 from 1 to 2, and at x=3 from 2 to 3. But the integral is from 0 to 3. So if the upper limit is 3, does the jump at 3 count? Let me think.

In the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, when integrating with respect to a step function, the integral over [a, b] includes the jumps at points where the integrator has discontinuities in [a, b]. Since the integral is from 0 to 3, inclusive, the jumps at x=1, 2, and 3 would all be included. Wait, but at x=3, the floor function is 3, but the interval [3, 3+1) is [3,4), but our upper limit is 3. So maybe the jump at 3 is not included because the interval is up to 3. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the integral from 0 to 3 of f(x) d⌊x⌋ is the sum over all points c in [0,3) where ⌊x⌋ has a jump. The floor function ⌊x⌋ jumps at each integer. So in the interval [0,3), the jumps are at 1, 2. But since the integral is up to 3, which is an integer, does the jump at 3 count? Let me check. If the integral is from a to b, then the jumps at a are included if the integrator is right-continuous, and jumps at b are not included. Wait, no, actually, in the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, the integral over [a, b] includes the jump at a if there is a jump there, but not at b. Wait, maybe I need to refer to the definition.

Alternatively, since the floor function is right-continuous, the integral from 0 to 3 would include the jumps at 1, 2, and 3? Wait, but at x=3, the floor function is 3, but the jump from 2 to 3 occurs exactly at x=3. So if the integral is up to and including 3, then the jump at 3 is included. But in the definition of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, the integral from a to b includes the point b, so if the integrator has a jump at b, it's included. So in this case, the integral from 0 to 3 would include the jump at 3. Therefore, the jumps are at x=1, 2, 3. But wait, when x=3, the floor function is 3, but the previous value just before 3 is 2. So the jump at x=3 is of size 1 (from 2 to 3). So the integral would be the sum of f(1)*1 + f(2)*1 + f(3)*1, since each jump is of size 1. Wait, but let me confirm.

Wait, the floor function ⌊x⌋ is constant on each interval [n, n+1), where n is an integer. So at each integer n, the floor function jumps by 1. Therefore, the measure associated with d⌊x⌋ is a sum of Dirac delta functions at each integer, each with weight 1. Therefore, the integral ∫_{0}^{3} f(x) d⌊x⌋ is equal to the sum of f(n) for n = 1, 2, 3. Wait, but 0 is included in the interval. Wait, the integral is from 0 to 3. So the points where the floor function jumps in [0,3] are at x=1, 2, 3. So the integral would be f(1) + f(2) + f(3). But wait, if the integral is from 0 to 3, inclusive, then the jump at x=0 is not included because the floor function at x=0 is 0, and the next jump is at x=1. So the jumps in [0,3] are at 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the integral is f(1) + f(2) + f(3). 

But let me check with a simple example. Suppose f(x) = 1. Then ∫_{0}^{3} 1 d⌊x⌋ would be the sum of 1*(jump at 1,2,3) = 1+1+1=3, which is equal to ⌊3⌋ - ⌊0⌋ = 3 - 0=3. That works. So yes, the integral of 1 d⌊x⌋ from 0 to 3 is 3. So in general, the integral of f(x) d⌊x⌋ from a to b is the sum of f(n) where n ranges over integers in (a, b] if the integrator is right-continuous. Wait, so if the integrator is right-continuous, then the jump at n is included in the integral from a to b if n is in (a, b]. So in our case, a=0, b=3. The integers in (0,3] are 1,2,3. Therefore, the integral is f(1) + f(2) + f(3). 

Therefore, for the given integral ∫₀³ (x² +1) d⌊x⌋, the value is (1² +1) + (2² +1) + (3² +1) = (1+1) + (4+1) + (9+1) = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17. 

Wait, but let me verify this. Let's compute each term:

At x=1: f(1) = 1² +1 = 2

At x=2: f(2) = 4 +1 =5

At x=3: f(3)=9 +1=10

Sum: 2+5+10=17. So the exact answer is 17. 

But let me check another way. Suppose we have a function that jumps at integers. The integral with respect to d⌊x⌋ is the sum over the jumps. Each jump contributes f(n) times the jump size. Since each jump is 1, it's just the sum of f(n) at each integer n where the jump occurs. So yes, from 0 to 3, the jumps are at 1,2,3. So sum is 2+5+10=17. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 17, and numerically that's 17.0000000000. 

Wait, but the problem says to include a numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places. Since 17 is an integer, the numerical approximation is exactly 17.0000000000. 

So the final answer should be {"answer": "17", "numerical_answer": 17.0000000000}. But let me check once more. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in including x=3. Let's think again. The integral is from 0 to 3. If the upper limit is 3, inclusive, then the jump at 3 is included. But in the definition of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, if the integrator is right-continuous, then the integral from a to b includes the jump at b. Since the floor function is right-continuous, the jump at 3 is included. Therefore, yes, x=3 is included. So the sum is indeed 17. 

Another way to check: if the integral was from 0 to 2, then the sum would be f(1) +f(2). For 0 to 2, sum is 2 +5=7. Then integrating from 0 to 3 would add f(3)=10, total 17. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is 17. The numerical approximation is 17.0000000000. So the JSON should be {"answer": "17", "numerical_answer": 17.0000000000}.
