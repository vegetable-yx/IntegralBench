Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is from 1 to π/3 of sec(x) times [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write it out again to see it clearly: ∫₁^{π/3} sec(x) [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx. So, the integrand is sec(x) multiplied by two terms: tan(x) log(x) and 1/x. Maybe I can split this into two separate integrals? Let's try that. So, split it into ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx. Wait, but the original integral is from 1 to π/3, so both integrals would have the same limits. But integrating each part separately might be tricky.

Looking at the first part: ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx. Hmm, sec(x) tan(x) is the derivative of sec(x), right? Because d/dx sec(x) = sec(x) tan(x). So maybe integration by parts could work here. Let me recall that integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. Let's set u = log(x), so du = 1/x dx. Then dv = sec(x) tan(x) dx, which means v = sec(x), since the integral of sec(x) tan(x) is sec(x). So applying integration by parts to the first integral: uv - ∫ v du. That would be log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x) * (1/x) dx. Wait a second! The second term here is exactly the negative of the second integral in our original problem. Because the original problem has + ∫ sec(x)/x dx. So when we combine them, the two integrals would cancel each other out? Let me check:

Original integral: ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx

After integrating the first part by parts, we get [log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx] + ∫ sec(x)/x dx. The two integrals ∫ sec(x)/x dx cancel each other, leaving just log(x) sec(x) evaluated from 1 to π/3. That seems too good to be true. Let me verify.

Yes, let's write it out:

Let I = ∫₁^{π/3} sec(x)[tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx

Split into I1 + I2 where I1 = ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx and I2 = ∫ sec(x)/x dx.

Compute I1 by parts: let u = log(x), dv = sec(x) tan(x) dx. Then du = (1/x) dx, v = sec(x).

So I1 = uv |₁^{π/3} - ∫ v du = [log(x) sec(x)]₁^{π/3} - ∫ sec(x)/x dx.

Therefore, I = I1 + I2 = [log(x) sec(x)]₁^{π/3} - ∫ sec(x)/x dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx = [log(x) sec(x)]₁^{π/3}.

So the integral simplifies to just the boundary terms. That's a nice simplification! So the exact answer is log(π/3) sec(π/3) - log(1) sec(1). But log(1) is 0, and sec(1) is 1/cos(1). So the exact answer is log(π/3) * sec(π/3) - 0, which is log(π/3) * 2, since sec(π/3) is 1/cos(π/3) = 2.

Wait, sec(π/3) is 1 divided by cos(π/3), and cos(π/3) is 0.5, so sec(π/3) is 2. Correct. So the exact answer is 2 log(π/3). Let me check that again. The evaluation at the upper limit π/3: log(π/3) * sec(π/3) = log(π/3) * 2. At the lower limit 1: log(1) * sec(1) = 0 * sec(1) = 0. So the entire result is 2 log(π/3). Therefore, the exact answer is 2 ln(π/3). Wait, but in the problem statement, is log base e or base 10? In mathematics, log usually denotes natural logarithm, so ln. So yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is 2 ln(π/3). Let me write that in LaTeX: 2 \ln\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right). Alternatively, 2 (\ln \pi - \ln 3). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first is simpler.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute 2 * ln(π/3). First, compute π/3: π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π/3 ≈ 1.0471975512. Then ln(1.0471975512). Let me calculate that. The natural logarithm of 1.0471975512. Let's see, ln(1) is 0, ln(1.05) is approximately 0.04879, and since 1.04719755 is slightly less than 1.05, the ln would be slightly less. Let me use a calculator. Let me compute ln(π/3):

π ≈ 3.141592653589793
π/3 ≈ 1.0471975511965976
ln(1.0471975511965976) ≈ 0.0461175971812615

Multiply by 2: 0.092235194362523. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.0922351944. Let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator:

ln(π/3) = ln(π) - ln(3). Let's compute ln(π) ≈ 1.1447298858494002, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098. So ln(π) - ln(3) ≈ 1.1447298858494002 - 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.0461175971812904. Multiply by 2: 0.0922351943625808. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.0922351944. So the numerical approximation is approximately 0.0922351944.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2 ln(π/3) and the numerical value is approximately 0.0922351944.
