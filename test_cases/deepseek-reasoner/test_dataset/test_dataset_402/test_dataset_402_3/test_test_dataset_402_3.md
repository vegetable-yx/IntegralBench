Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to π/3 of sec(x) times [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write out the integral again to make sure I have it right:

∫₁^{π/3} sec(x) [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx

So, the integrand is sec(x) multiplied by two terms: tan(x) log(x) and 1/x. Maybe I can split this into two separate integrals:

∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx

But integrating each part separately might not be straightforward. Let me see if there's a substitution or integration by parts that can help here.

Looking at the first part: sec(x) tan(x) log(x). The derivative of sec(x) is sec(x) tan(x), right? So maybe if I set u = log(x), and dv = sec(x) tan(x) dx. Then du would be 1/x dx, and v would be sec(x). Let's try integration by parts on the first integral.

Integration by parts formula is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So for the first integral:

u = log(x) ⇒ du = (1/x) dx

dv = sec(x) tan(x) dx ⇒ v = sec(x)

So applying the formula:

∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx = log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x) * (1/x) dx

Wait, that's interesting. The second term here is the negative of the second integral in our original problem. So putting it all together:

Original integral = [log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx] from 1 to π/3 + ∫ sec(x)/x dx from 1 to π/3

But when we expand that, the two integrals ∫ sec(x)/x dx cancel each other. Let me check:

Original integral = ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log(x) dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx

But after integration by parts, the first integral becomes log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx. So when we add the second integral:

log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx = log(x) sec(x) evaluated from 1 to π/3

So the entire integral simplifies to [log(x) sec(x)] from 1 to π/3. That's a huge simplification! So the answer is just log(π/3) sec(π/3) - log(1) sec(1)

But log(1) is 0, so that term drops out. So the integral is log(π/3) * sec(π/3)

Wait, let me verify this again. Integration by parts on the first part gives log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx. Then adding the original second integral, which is ∫ sec(x)/x dx, so the two integrals cancel. Therefore, the total integral is just the evaluated term log(x) sec(x) from 1 to π/3.

Yes, that seems right. So the exact answer is log(π/3) * sec(π/3) - log(1) * sec(1). Since log(1) is 0, and sec(1) is 1/cos(1), but since log(1)=0, the second term is 0. So the exact answer is log(π/3) * sec(π/3).

Now, let's compute that. First, sec(π/3) is 1/cos(π/3). Cos(π/3) is 0.5, so sec(π/3) is 2. Therefore, the exact answer is 2 log(π/3). Alternatively, log(π/3) multiplied by 2.

But let me check if there's any mistake here. Let me re-express the integral:

∫₁^{π/3} sec(x) [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx

After splitting into two integrals, the first part is handled by integration by parts, leading to log(x) sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx. Then adding the second integral, which is ∫ sec(x)/x dx, so the integral becomes log(x) sec(x) evaluated from 1 to π/3. That's correct. So the exact answer is log(π/3) * sec(π/3) - log(1) * sec(1). Since log(1)=0, it's just log(π/3) * 2.

Therefore, exact answer is 2 log(π/3). But wait, log(π/3) is the natural logarithm? Yes, since the problem didn't specify, but in calculus, log is usually natural log.

So exact answer is 2 ln(π/3). Let me write that in LaTeX: 2 \ln\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)

But wait, maybe I should check if there's a different way to present it. Alternatively, 2 \ln(\pi) - 2 \ln(3). But the problem says to present the exact answer, so either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first form is better.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute 2 * ln(π/3). First, compute π/3: approximately 1.0471975512. Then ln(1.0471975512) ≈ 0.0461175972. Multiply by 2: 0.0922351944. Let me check with a calculator.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. π ≈ 3.141592653589793. So π/3 ≈ 1.0471975511965976. Then ln(π/3) ≈ ln(1.0471975511965976). Let me compute that.

Using a calculator, ln(1.0471975511965976) is approximately 0.0461175972. Multiply by 2: 0.0922351944. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.0922351944. But let me verify this with a precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator for ln(π/3):

π/3 ≈ 1.0471975511965976

ln(1.0471975511965976) ≈ 0.0461175972585355

Multiply by 2: 0.092235194517071

So rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.0922351945. Wait, the 11th decimal is 7, so rounding up the 10th from 4 to 5? Wait, 0.092235194517071: the 10th decimal is the 4th after the decimal: wait, no. Wait, 0.0922351945 is the number. Let's count:

0.0 9 2 2 3 5 1 9 4 5 1 7... So the first decimal place is 0, then 9, 2, 2, 3, 5, 1, 9, 4, 5, 1, 7. Wait, actually, the decimal places are:

0.0 (1st), 9 (2nd), 2 (3rd), 2 (4th), 3 (5th), 5 (6th), 1 (7th), 9 (8th), 4 (9th), 5 (10th), 1 (11th), 7 (12th). So the 10th decimal is 5, and the 11th is 1, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, the 10 decimal approximation is 0.0922351945.

Wait, but when I compute 2 * ln(π/3):

π/3.141592653589793/3=1.0471975511965976

ln(1.0471975511965976)=0.0461175972585355

Multiply by 2: 0.092235194517071

So 0.092235194517071, so up to 10 decimal places: 0.0922351945 (since the 11th is 1, which is less than 5, so the 10th stays 5). Wait, but wait, 0.092235194517071 is:

0.0922351945 (positions 1-10: 0.0922351945) and then 17071... So the 10th decimal is 5, and the next digit is 1, so it's 0.0922351945 when rounded to 10 decimals.

But let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, use a calculator to compute the integral numerically. Wait, but according to our analytical solution, the integral is 2 ln(π/3). So the numerical value is 2 * ln(π/3) ≈ 0.0922351945. But maybe I should check with a numerical integration to confirm that the analytical solution is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me double-check.

Original integral: ∫ sec(x)[tan(x) log x + 1/x] dx

Split into two parts: ∫ sec(x) tan(x) log x dx + ∫ sec(x)/x dx

First integral: let u = log x, dv = sec(x) tan(x) dx

Then du = (1/x) dx, v = sec(x)

So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = log x * sec(x) - ∫ sec(x)/x dx

Therefore, the first integral is log x sec x - ∫ sec x /x dx. Then adding the second integral, which is ∫ sec x /x dx, so they cancel. Therefore, the total integral is log x sec x evaluated from 1 to π/3.

Yes, that's correct. So the result is [log x sec x] from 1 to π/3.

At x=π/3: log(π/3) * sec(π/3) = log(π/3) * 2

At x=1: log(1) * sec(1) = 0 * sec(1) = 0

Therefore, the exact answer is 2 log(π/3). So the numerical value is 2 * ln(π/3) ≈ 0.0922351945 as calculated.

Therefore, the exact answer in LaTeX is 2 \ln\left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right ), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.0922351945.
