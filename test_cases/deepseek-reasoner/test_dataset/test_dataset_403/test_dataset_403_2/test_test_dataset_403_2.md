Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of [log(1/x)]^7 dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the integrand. The logarithm of 1/x is the same as -log(x), right? Because log(1/x) = -log(x). So the integrand simplifies to (-log(x))^7, which is (-1)^7 [log(x)]^7. Since (-1)^7 is -1, that becomes -[log(x)]^7. Wait, but the integral is from 0 to 1. Hmm, but maybe I should keep it as [log(1/x)]^7 to make substitution easier.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution would help here. Let me think. The integral is ∫₀¹ [log(1/x)]⁷ dx. Let me make a substitution to simplify this. Let’s set t = -log(x), which is the same as t = log(1/x). Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So the limits of integration would change from x=0 to x=1 into t=∞ to t=0. But since the integral is from 0 to 1, substituting t would reverse the limits. Let me write that out.

So, if t = -log(x), then dt/dx = -1/x. Therefore, dx = -x dt. But x can be expressed in terms of t: since t = -log(x), then x = e^{-t}. So dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when x=0, t=∞, and x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes:

∫_{x=0}^{x=1} [log(1/x)]^7 dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^7 (-e^{-t} dt). The negative sign flips the limits back to 0 to ∞, so:

= ∫₀^∞ t^7 e^{-t} dt.

Oh! Wait a minute, that's the definition of the Gamma function. The Gamma function Γ(n) is ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt. So in this case, we have t^7 e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(8), because n-1 = 7 implies n=8. And Γ(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers. So Γ(8) = 7! = 5040. Therefore, the integral is 5040.

But let me check that substitution again. Let me verify step by step. Starting with the substitution t = -log(x), so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then when x=0, t=∞; x=1, t=0. So substituting into the integral:

∫₀¹ [log(1/x)]⁷ dx = ∫_{∞}^0 t^7 (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^7 e^{-t} dt. Yes, that's correct. The integral becomes Γ(8) = 7! = 5040. So the exact value is 5040.

Now, for the numerical approximation, 5040 is an integer, so the numerical value is exactly 5040.0000000000. But maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Wait, is the substitution correct? Let me verify with a simpler case. For example, if the exponent was 1 instead of 7, then the integral would be Γ(2) = 1! = 1. Let's check that. ∫₀¹ log(1/x) dx = ∫₀¹ -log(x) dx. Integration by parts: let u = -log(x), dv = dx. Then du = -1/x dx, v = x. So uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du = [-x log(x)]₀¹ + ∫ x*(1/x) dx. At x=1, -1*log(1)=0. At x=0, the term is -0*log(0), which is 0 (since x log(x) approaches 0 as x approaches 0). Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. Which matches Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So that works. Therefore, for the 7th power, it's Γ(8) = 7! = 5040. So the exact answer is 5040, and numerically it's 5040.0000000000.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check another example. Suppose the exponent is 2. Then the integral would be ∫₀¹ [log(1/x)]² dx. Using substitution t = -log(x), same as before, integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t² e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. Let's compute it directly. ∫₀¹ (-log(x))² dx. Integration by parts: let u = (log(1/x))² = ( - log x )² = (log x)^2. Let dv = dx. Then du = 2 log(1/x) * (1/x) dx. Wait, maybe better to do substitution. Alternatively, using the same substitution, we get Γ(3) = 2! = 2. Let me compute it directly. Let’s try integrating by parts. Let u = (log x)^2, dv = dx. Then du = 2 log x * (1/x) dx, v = x. Then uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du. At x=1, u = 0, v=1. At x=0, u is (log 0)^2 which is infinity, but multiplied by x=0, so 0*infinity. Let's compute the limit as x approaches 0+ of x*(log x)^2. Let t approach infinity, set x = e^{-t}, so t approaches infinity. Then x*(log x)^2 = e^{-t} * t^2. As t→infty, e^{-t} t^2 →0. So the boundary term is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the integral becomes - ∫ x * 2 log x * (1/x) dx = -2 ∫ log x dx. Which is -2 [x log x - x] from 0 to 1. At x=1: 1*0 -1 = -1. At x=0: 0 -0 (since x log x approaches 0). So -2 [ (-1) - 0 ] = 2. Which matches Γ(3) =2. So that works. Therefore, the substitution method is correct. Therefore, for the 7th power, the integral is indeed Γ(8) =7! =5040. So the exact answer is 5040, and the numerical approximation is 5040.0000000000. Therefore, the JSON output should be {"answer": "5040", "numerical_answer": 5040.0000000000}. But wait, the problem says to put the exact answer in LaTeX. The exact answer is 5040, which is just 5040. So in LaTeX, that's 5040. So the JSON is as above. I think that's correct.
