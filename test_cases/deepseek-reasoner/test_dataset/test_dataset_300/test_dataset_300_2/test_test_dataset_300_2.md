Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is:

∫₀¹ x⁰·⁵ (1 - x)⁰·⁵ (2 - x)^(-0.5 - 2×0.5 - 2) ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)²) dx

First, I need to simplify the exponents and the integrand. Let's start with the exponent of (2 - x). The exponent is given as -0.5 - 2×0.5 - 2. Let's compute that:

-0.5 - 2×0.5 - 2 = -0.5 - 1 - 2 = -3.5, which is the same as -7/2. So the integrand becomes:

x^(1/2) (1 - x)^(1/2) (2 - x)^(-7/2) ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)²) dx

Hmm, that's quite a complex integrand. Let's see if we can simplify the logarithms first. The log terms are:

ln(x/(2 - x)) and ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)²)

Let me expand the second logarithm:

ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)²) = ln(1 - x) - 2 ln(2 - x)

Similarly, the first logarithm is ln(x) - ln(2 - x). So the product of the two would be:

[ln(x) - ln(2 - x)] [ln(1 - x) - 2 ln(2 - x)]

Expanding this product:

ln(x) ln(1 - x) - 2 ln(x) ln(2 - x) - ln(2 - x) ln(1 - x) + 2 [ln(2 - x)]²

So the integrand is:

x^(1/2) (1 - x)^(1/2) (2 - x)^(-7/2) [ln(x) ln(1 - x) - 2 ln(x) ln(2 - x) - ln(2 - x) ln(1 - x) + 2 (ln(2 - x))²] dx

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a substitution that can simplify this. Let's consider substitution variables. Let me see if a substitution like t = x/(2 - x) would help. Let's try that.

Let t = x/(2 - x). Then solving for x: x = 2t/(1 + t). Then dx/dt = 2(1 + t) - 2t)/(1 + t)^2 = 2/(1 + t)^2.

When x = 0, t = 0. When x = 1, t = 1/(2 - 1) = 1. So the limits of integration become t from 0 to 1.

Let's substitute x = 2t/(1 + t) into the integrand.

First, compute 2 - x = 2 - 2t/(1 + t) = (2(1 + t) - 2t)/(1 + t) = 2/(1 + t)

So (2 - x) = 2/(1 + t), so (2 - x)^(-7/2) = [2/(1 + t)]^(-7/2) = (1 + t)^(7/2) / 2^(7/2)

x^(1/2) = [2t/(1 + t)]^(1/2) = (2t)^(1/2)/(1 + t)^(1/2)

(1 - x) = 1 - 2t/(1 + t) = (1 + t - 2t)/(1 + t) = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

So (1 - x)^(1/2) = [(1 - t)/(1 + t)]^(1/2) = (1 - t)^(1/2)/(1 + t)^(1/2)

Putting all these into the integrand:

x^(1/2) (1 - x)^(1/2) (2 - x)^(-7/2) = [ (2t)^(1/2)/(1 + t)^(1/2) ) ] * [ (1 - t)^(1/2)/(1 + t)^(1/2) ) ] * [ (1 + t)^(7/2)/2^(7/2) )

Multiplying these together:

(2t)^(1/2) * (1 - t)^(1/2) / (1 + t)^(1/2 + 1/2) ) * (1 + t)^(7/2)/2^(7/2)

Simplify the exponents:

Denominator from first two terms: (1 + t)^(1)

So overall:

2^(1/2) t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) / (1 + t) ) * (1 + t)^(7/2)/2^(7/2)

Combine the 2 exponents: 2^(1/2 - 7/2) = 2^(-3) = 1/8

Combine (1 + t) exponents: (1 + t)^(7/2 - 1) = (1 + t)^(5/2)

So the term becomes:

(1/8) t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2)

Now, the integrand also includes the logarithm terms. Let's substitute the logarithms in terms of t.

Original log terms:

ln(x/(2 - x)) = ln(t) [since x/(2 - x) = t]

And ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) = ln( (1 - x) ) - 2 ln(2 - x)

But we can express 1 - x in terms of t:

1 - x = (1 - t)/(1 + t) as before.

So ln(1 - x) = ln( (1 - t)/(1 + t) ) = ln(1 - t) - ln(1 + t)

And ln(2 - x) = ln(2/(1 + t)) = ln(2) - ln(1 + t)

Therefore, ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) = [ln(1 - t) - ln(1 + t)] - 2[ln(2) - ln(1 + t)] = ln(1 - t) - ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2 + 2 ln(1 + t) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2

So the product of the two logarithms:

ln(x/(2 - x)) * ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) = ln t [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2]

So putting it all together, the integral becomes:

(1/8) ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

Wait, no, the logarithm terms are multiplied by the rest. Let me check again.

Wait, the product of the logs is:

[ln t] * [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2]

So the entire integrand after substitution is:

(1/8) t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) * [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

Hmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe we can split the integral into three parts:

Integral = (1/8) [ Integral A + Integral B - 2 ln 2 Integral C ]

Where:

Integral A = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t ln(1 - t) dt

Integral B = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t ln(1 + t) dt

Integral C = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t dt

This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better substitution or perhaps recognizing a beta function or hypergeometric function here. Alternatively, perhaps differentiating under the integral sign with respect to a parameter.

Alternatively, let's consider expanding (1 + t)^(5/2). But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, note that (1 + t)^(5/2) can be written as (1 + t)^2 (1 + t)^(1/2). So:

(1 + t)^(5/2) = (1 + t)^2 * (1 + t)^(1/2)

But then the integrand becomes:

t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^2 * [log terms]

Which is t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^2 = t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2)

Alternatively, perhaps we can write (1 - t^2)^(1/2) from (1 - t)(1 + t), but here we have (1 - t)^(1/2) and (1 + t)^(5/2). Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider another substitution. Let u = t. Then maybe not helpful. Alternatively, u = 1 - t. Let's see.

If u = 1 - t, then when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. The integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 0, which we can reverse the limits and get a negative sign. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using hypergeometric functions. But I need to think if there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiating a beta function. Let's recall that the Beta function is ∫₀¹ t^{c-1} (1 - t)^{d-1} dt = B(c, d). If we can express the integral in terms of Beta functions and their derivatives with respect to parameters.

Given that the integrand includes terms like t, (1 - t), (1 + t), and logarithms, which can be obtained by differentiating Beta functions with respect to their parameters.

For example, the integral ∫ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} ln t dt can be expressed as the derivative of B(a+1, b+1) with respect to a.

Similarly, integrals with ln(1 - t) can be expressed as derivatives with respect to b.

But in our case, the integrand is more complicated because of the (1 + t)^(5/2) term. However, perhaps we can write (1 + t)^(5/2) as a hypergeometric function or expand it in a series.

Alternatively, (1 + t)^(5/2) can be expanded using binomial expansion:

(1 + t)^(5/2) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (5/2 choose k) ) t^k, but this converges for |t| < 1, which is our case since t is from 0 to 1.

But integrating term by term might be possible, but with the log terms, this could get complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the entire integrand as a product of terms and use differentiation under the integral sign with multiple parameters.

Let me consider introducing parameters into the integral. Let's define:

I(a, b, c) = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} (1 + t)^{c} dt

Then, the integrals A, B, C can be expressed in terms of derivatives of I(a, b, c) with respect to a, b, or c.

But in our case, the integrand includes terms like ln t, ln(1 - t), ln(1 + t), which are derivatives with respect to the parameters a, b, c.

For example:

∂I/∂a = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} (1 + t)^{c} ln t dt

Similarly,

∂I/∂b = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} (1 + t)^{c} ln(1 - t) dt

∂I/∂c = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} (1 + t)^{c} ln(1 + t) dt

Therefore, Integral A is ∂²I/(∂a ∂b) evaluated at certain a, b, c. Similarly, Integral B is ∂²I/(∂a ∂c), and Integral C is ∂I/∂a.

But in our case, the exponents are a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 5/2. Wait, let's check:

Original integrand after substitution is:

(1/8) t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

So, expanding the terms:

(1/8) [ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t) + t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2 t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ]

Therefore, each term corresponds to:

First term: ∂²I/(∂a ∂b) evaluated at a=1/2, b=1/2, c=5/2

Second term: ∂²I/(∂a ∂c) evaluated at a=1/2, b=1/2, c=5/2

Third term: 2 ln 2 * ∂I/∂a evaluated at a=1/2, b=1/2, c=5/2

So, if we can compute I(a, b, c) and its derivatives, we can find the integral components.

But the problem is to compute I(a, b, c) = ∫₀¹ t^a (1 - t)^b (1 + t)^c dt. This integral might not have a straightforward expression in terms of Beta functions or hypergeometric functions, but perhaps we can express it using the hypergeometric function.

Recall that ∫₀¹ t^a (1 - t)^b (1 + t)^c dt can be expressed using the hypergeometric function ₂F₁. Let's recall that (1 + t)^c can be written as a hypergeometric series:

(1 + t)^c = ₂F₁(-c, ; 1; -t)

But integrating term by term:

I(a, b, c) = ∫₀¹ t^a (1 - t)^b Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-c)_k /k! (-t)^k dt

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-c)_k (-1)^k /k! ∫₀¹ t^{a + k} (1 - t)^b dt

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ (c)_k /k! ∫₀¹ t^{a + k} (1 - t)^b dt

Wait, since (-c)_k (-1)^k = (c)_k. Because (-c)_k = (-c)(-c +1)...(-c +k -1) and (-1)^k (c)_k = (c)(c +1)...(c +k -1) (-1)^k. Hmm, maybe my previous step is incorrect. Let me check.

Actually, the expansion of (1 + t)^c is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (c choose k) t^k, where (c choose k) = Γ(c +1)/[Γ(k +1) Γ(c -k +1)]. But this is valid for any c, not necessarily integer. However, this series converges for |t| < 1, which is our case. So:

(1 + t)^c = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{c}{k} t^k

Therefore, I(a, b, c) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{c}{k} ∫₀¹ t^{a + k} (1 - t)^b dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{c}{k} B(a + k +1, b +1)

Where B is the Beta function. So:

I(a, b, c) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{c}{k} B(a + k +1, b +1)

But this might not be helpful for taking derivatives. Alternatively, perhaps express the Beta function in terms of Gamma functions:

B(a + k +1, b +1) = Γ(a + k +1) Γ(b +1)/Γ(a + b + k + 2)

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, if we can find a closed-form expression for I(a, b, c), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using integral representations or transformations. Let me consider another substitution. Let u = t/(1 + t). Wait, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that (1 + t)^c = e^{c ln(1 + t)}, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, consider that I(a, b, c) can be written as 2^{a + b + c +1} ∫₀^{1/2} u^a (1 - u)^b (1 - 2u)^{-a - b - c -2} du, but this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using Mellin transforms or other integral transforms. But this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, let's check if specific values of a, b, c make the integral simplify. In our case, a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 5/2. Let's compute I(1/2, 1/2, 5/2).

I(1/2, 1/2, 5/2) = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Hmm, perhaps expanding (1 + t)^{5/2} as (1 + t)^2 (1 + t)^{1/2} = (1 + 2t + t²)(1 + t)^{1/2}

But then the integrand becomes (1 + 2t + t²) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}

= (1 + 2t + t²) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}

= (1 + 2t + t²) t^{1/2} [(1 - t)(1 + t)]^{1/2}

= (1 + 2t + t²) t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2}

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (1 + 2t + t²) t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt

This seems more manageable. Let's split this into three integrals:

I1 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt

I2 = 2 ∫₀¹ t^{3/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt

I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{5/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt

So I(1/2, 1/2, 5/2) = I1 + I2 + I3

Each of these integrals can be expressed in terms of Beta functions. Let's compute each one.

For I1: let u = t², then t = u^{1/2}, dt = (1/2) u^{-1/2} du. When t=0, u=0; t=1, u=1.

I1 = ∫₀¹ u^{1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} (1/2) u^{-1/2} du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{-1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} du = (1/2) B(3/4, 3/2)

Similarly, I2 = 2 ∫₀¹ t^{3/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt. Let u = t², t = u^{1/2}, dt = (1/2) u^{-1/2} du.

I2 = 2 ∫₀¹ u^{3/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} (1/2) u^{-1/2} du = 2*(1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} du = B(5/4, 3/2)

Similarly, I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{5/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} dt. Let u = t²:

I3 = ∫₀¹ u^{5/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} (1/2) u^{-1/2} du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{3/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} du = (1/2) B(7/4, 3/2)

So, I(1/2, 1/2, 5/2) = (1/2) B(3/4, 3/2) + B(5/4, 3/2) + (1/2) B(7/4, 3/2)

Now, recall that B(p, q) = Γ(p) Γ(q)/Γ(p + q)

We can compute these Beta functions. Let's compute each term:

First term: (1/2) B(3/4, 3/2) = (1/2) Γ(3/4) Γ(3/2)/Γ(3/4 + 3/2) = (1/2) Γ(3/4) Γ(3/2)/Γ(9/4)

Second term: B(5/4, 3/2) = Γ(5/4) Γ(3/2)/Γ(11/4)

Third term: (1/2) B(7/4, 3/2) = (1/2) Γ(7/4) Γ(3/2)/Γ(13/4)

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or simplification using properties of the Gamma function.

Recall that Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z). Let's compute each term:

First term:

Γ(3/4) is as is.

Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π

Γ(9/4) = Γ(5/4 + 1) = (5/4) Γ(5/4)

So first term:

(1/2) * Γ(3/4) * (1/2)√π / (5/4 Γ(5/4)) ) = (1/4) √π Γ(3/4) / (5/4 Γ(5/4)) ) = (1/5) √π Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4)

But Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4), since Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z). So Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4). Wait, no:

Wait, Γ(1/4 + 1) = (1/4) Γ(1/4), so Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4). Similarly, Γ(3/4 + 1) = Γ(7/4) = (3/4) Γ(3/4)

But how does Γ(3/4) relate to Γ(5/4)? Let's see:

Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4), and Γ(3/4) is a separate value. There's a reflection formula for Gamma functions, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, using the property Γ(z) Γ(1 - z) = π / sin(π z). For z = 1/4, Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (√2/2) ) = π√2.

So Γ(3/4) = π√2 / Γ(1/4)

But this might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4):

Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4) = Γ(3/4) / [ (1/4) Γ(1/4) ] = 4 Γ(3/4)/Γ(1/4)

But using the reflection formula, Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π√2, so Γ(3/4) = π√2 / Γ(1/4). Therefore:

Γ(3/4)/Γ(1/4) = π√2 / [Γ(1/4)]²

So 4 Γ(3/4)/Γ(1/4) = 4 π√2 / [Γ(1/4)]²

But this seems to complicate things further. Maybe it's better to leave it in terms of Gamma functions.

Alternatively, perhaps numerical evaluation is needed here. But since the original problem asks for an exact answer, we need to find a way to express this in terms of known constants or simpler functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be related to derivatives of the Beta function with respect to parameters. Let's recall that the original integrals A, B, C are derivatives of I(a, b, c). So perhaps we can express the integral in terms of derivatives of the Beta function or hypergeometric functions.

But this is getting quite involved. Let me think if there's a smarter substitution or if the integrand can be expressed as a derivative.

Wait, going back to the original integral after substitution t = x/(2 - x), we have:

Integral = (1/8) [ Integral A + Integral B - 2 ln 2 Integral C ]

Where:

Integral A = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t ln(1 - t) dt

Integral B = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t ln(1 + t) dt

Integral C = ∫₀¹ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) ln t dt

But perhaps there's a way to express these integrals in terms of known constants. Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts.

Let's consider Integral C first. Let's try integrating by parts. Let u = ln t, dv = t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) dt

Then du = (1/t) dt, and v = ∫ t^(1/2) (1 - t)^(1/2) (1 + t)^(5/2) dt, which is the same as I(1/2, 1/2, 5/2) but indefinite. This might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiating under the integral sign. Let's consider introducing a parameter into the integral.

For example, let’s define:

J(k) = ∫₀¹ t^{k} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Then, Integral C is J’(1/2), since d/dk J(k) = ∫ t^{k} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

Similarly, J(k) can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or Beta functions, but again, this might not lead to a simple expression.

Alternatively, perhaps using known integrals. Let me check if Gradshteyn and Ryzhik has similar integrals. For example, integral 4.253 might be relevant, which includes integrals of x^μ (1 - x)^ν (1 + β x)^ρ dx. But without access to the exact reference, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, let's consider that the integral might evaluate to zero. Sometimes, integrals with symmetric properties or odd functions can vanish. But in this case, the integrand after substitution is from t=0 to t=1, and the integrand doesn't seem to be odd or have obvious symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of π and logarithms. Given the presence of sqrt terms and logs, maybe the result involves π and ln 2 or something similar.

Alternatively, let's consider numerical evaluation. The problem does ask for a numerical approximation as well. Maybe compute the integral numerically to check if it's a simple number. But since the user wants an exact answer first, we need to find that.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral simplifies to zero. Let me test with numerical approximation.

But before that, let's see if there's a mistake in the substitution or setup. Let me double-check the substitution steps.

Original integral:

∫₀¹ x^{1/2} (1 - x)^{1/2} (2 - x)^{-7/2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) dx

Substitution t = x/(2 - x) => x = 2t/(1 + t), dx = 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Then, 2 - x = 2/(1 + t), 1 - x = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

The integrand becomes:

x^{1/2} = (2t/(1 + t))^{1/2}

(1 - x)^{1/2} = ((1 - t)/(1 + t))^{1/2}

(2 - x)^{-7/2} = (2/(1 + t))^{-7/2} = (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2}

The log terms:

ln(x/(2 - x)) = ln t

ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) = ln((1 - t)/(1 + t)) - 2 ln(2/(1 + t)) = ln(1 - t) - ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2 + 2 ln(1 + t) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2

So the product of the logs is:

ln t [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2]

Putting it all together:

Integral = (1/8) ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, perhaps expanding the terms:

= (1/8) [ ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t) dt

+ ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 + t) dt

- 2 ln 2 ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt ]

Let’s consider each integral separately.

Let’s denote:

I1 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t) dt

I2 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 + t) dt

I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

So Integral = (I1 + I2 - 2 ln 2 I3)/8

Now, perhaps integrating by parts each integral.

Let’s start with I3. Let’s set u = ln t, dv = t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Then du = (1/t) dt, and v = ∫ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

But integrating v is not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps differentiating with respect to a parameter.

Let’s consider that I3 is the derivative of some Beta function with parameters. Let’s define:

F(a) = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Then, I3 = F’(1/2)

Similarly, I1 involves derivatives with respect to a and b, and I2 involves derivatives with respect to a and c.

But without a closed-form expression for F(a), it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps using known values. For example, if we can express F(a) in terms of hypergeometric functions, then take derivatives.

Recall that F(a) = ∫₀¹ t^a (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

We can expand (1 + t)^{5/2} using binomial series:

(1 + t)^{5/2} = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} t^k

Thus,

F(a) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} ∫₀¹ t^{a + k} (1 - t)^{1/2} dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} B(a + k +1, 3/2)

Where B is the Beta function. Then,

F(a) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} Γ(a + k +1) Γ(3/2)/Γ(a + k + 5/2)

But this series might not converge nicely, and taking its derivative with respect to a would be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using numerical methods to approximate the integral. Since the user also requires a numerical approximation, maybe we can compute it numerically.

But the problem states to first compute the integral analytically. However, given the complexity, it's possible that the integral evaluates to zero due to symmetry or other reasons. Let me check for possible symmetries.

Let’s consider the substitution t = 1 - u in the original integral after substitution. Let’s set u = 1 - t. Then when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. The integral becomes:

I3 = ∫₀¹ (1 - u)^{1/2} u^{1/2} (2 - u)^{5/2} ln(1 - u) du

Wait, no, the original I3 is:

I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

Changing variable u = 1 - t:

I3 = ∫₀¹ (1 - u)^{1/2} u^{1/2} (2 - u)^{5/2} ln(1 - u) du

But this to the original I3, it's not symmetric. So symmetry might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand is an odd function about t=1/2, but I don't see that.

Alternatively, consider that the log terms might lead to cancellation. But without further insight, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress in finding an analytical solution, I might need to consider that this integral might evaluate to a simple expression involving π and log terms, possibly zero. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is designed to be zero.

Let me test this hypothesis. Suppose we substitute t = 1 - u in I3:

I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

= ∫₀¹ (1 - u)^{1/2} u^{1/2} (2 - u)^{5/2} ln(1 - u) du

But this is not directly related to the original I3 unless there's a symmetry. However, if we add I3 and this transformed integral:

I3 + I3_transformed = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} [ln t + ln(1 - t)] dt

But this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, consider that the integrand of the original integral might be a perfect derivative. Let me check:

Suppose we have a function F(x) whose derivative is the integrand. If we can find such F(x), then the integral would be F(1) - F(0). But given the complexity of the integrand, this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand can be expressed as the derivative of some combination of terms involving x^{...} (1 - x)^{...} (2 - x)^{...} multiplied by logs. But this is speculative.

Given the time I've spent without progress, I might need to consider that this integral evaluates to zero. To check, let's approximate it numerically.

Let me compute the original integral numerically.

The original integral is:

∫₀¹ sqrt(x) sqrt(1 - x) (2 - x)^{-7/2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) dx

Let’s approximate this numerically. Let's use substitution t = x, and split the integral into parts where the integrand is well-behaved.

But since I don't have a calculator here, I can estimate it. Alternatively, note that the integrand might be antisymmetric in some transformed variable, leading to cancellation. For example, if we let x = 2 - u, but the limits would change, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, consider that the integrand might be the derivative of a product involving the logs. Let’s consider differentiating a product like sqrt(x) sqrt(1 - x) (2 - x)^{-something} times the logs. But this is vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is zero. Let me assume that and check if it makes sense.

If the integral is zero, then the exact answer would be 0, and the numerical approximation would be 0.0000000000. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, let's consider specific values. For example, at x=0, the integrand is zero because of sqrt(x). At x=1, the integrand has sqrt(1 - x) which is zero. So the integrand is zero at both limits. However, the behavior in between could be positive or negative.

Let’s pick a sample point, say x=0.5.

Compute the integrand at x=0.5:

sqrt(0.5) * sqrt(0.5) * (2 - 0.5)^{-7/2} * ln(0.5/(1.5)) * ln(0.5/(1.5)^2)

Compute each term:

sqrt(0.5)*sqrt(0.5) = 0.5

(1.5)^{-7/2} = (3/2)^{-7/2} = (2/3)^{7/2} ≈ (2/3)^3 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ (8/27) * 0.8165 ≈ 0.244

ln(0.5/1.5) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

ln(0.5/(1.5)^2) = ln(0.5/2.25) = ln(1/4.5) ≈ -1.5041

So the integrand at x=0.5 is approximately 0.5 * 0.244 * (-1.0986) * (-1.5041) ≈ 0.5 * 0.244 * 1.651 ≈ 0.5 * 0.402 ≈ 0.201

Positive value. So the integrand is positive at x=0.5. What about x=0.25:

x=0.25:

sqrt(0.25)=0.5, sqrt(1 - 0.25)=sqrt(0.75)≈0.866, (2 - 0.25)^{-7/2}=1.75^{-3.5}≈1/(1.75^3.5). Compute 1.75^3=5.359, 1.75^0.5≈1.322, so 5.359*1.322≈7.08, so 1/7.08≈0.141.

ln(0.25/(2 - 0.25))=ln(0.25/1.75)=ln(1/7)≈-1.9459

ln((1 - 0.25)/(2 - 0.25)^2)=ln(0.75/(1.75)^2)=ln(0.75/3.0625)=ln(0.245)≈-1.406

So integrand≈0.5*0.866*0.141*(-1.9459)*(-1.406)≈0.5*0.866*0.141*2.737≈0.5*0.866*0.386≈0.5*0.334≈0.167

Positive again. At x=0.75:

sqrt(0.75)≈0.866, sqrt(1 - 0.75)=0.5, (2 - 0.75)^{-7/2}=1.25^{-3.5}=1/(1.25^3.5). 1.25^3=1.953, 1.25^0.5≈1.118, so 1.953*1.118≈2.183, so 1/2.183≈0.458.

ln(0.75/(2 - 0.75))=ln(0.75/1.25)=ln(0.6)≈-0.5108

ln((1 - 0.75)/(2 - 0.75)^2)=ln(0.25/(1.25)^2)=ln(0.25/1.5625)=ln(0.16)≈-1.8326

So integrand≈0.866*0.5*0.458*(-0.5108)*(-1.8326)≈0.866*0.5*0.458*0.935≈0.866*0.5*0.428≈0.866*0.214≈0.185

Still positive. So the integrand is positive in (0,1), so the integral should be positive. Therefore, the hypothesis that it's zero is incorrect.

Given that, and given the time I've spent without finding an analytical solution, perhaps the integral is designed to be evaluated using a substitution that simplifies the log terms.

Let me revisit the original integrand after substitution t = x/(2 - x). The integrand becomes:

(1/8) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

Let me consider the term [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)]. This can be written as:

ln t [ln((1 - t)(1 + t)) - 2 ln 2] = ln t [ln(1 - t²) - 2 ln 2]

So the integrand is:

(1/8) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t [ln(1 - t²) - 2 ln 2] dt

Hmm, maybe this helps. Let's split into two parts:

= (1/8) [ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) - 2 ln 2 t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ] dt

The second term is -2 ln 2 times I3 we considered earlier. The first term is a new integral, let's call it I4:

I4 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) dt

But ln(1 - t²) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t), so I4 is the same as I1 + I2. Wait, no:

Wait, ln(1 - t²) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t), so I4 = ∫₀¹ ... ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t)) dt = I1 + I2

But earlier, the original integral was (I1 + I2 - 2 ln 2 I3)/8, which is (I4 - 2 ln 2 I3)/8

So, Integral = (I4 - 2 ln 2 I3)/8

But I4 is ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) dt

Perhaps integrating by parts with respect to ln(1 - t²). Let’s set u = ln t ln(1 - t²), dv = t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, set u = ln(1 - t²), dv = t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

But again, not helpful.

Alternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign with respect to a parameter. Let’s introduce a parameter s into the exponent of (1 - t²):

Let’s define:

K(s) = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} (1 - t²)^s dt

Then, I4 = dK/ds evaluated at s=0.

But this might not help unless we can compute K(s).

Alternatively, expand (1 - t²)^s as a series:

(1 - t²)^s = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{s}{k} (-t²)^k

But integrating term by term would give:

K(s) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{s}{k} (-1)^k ∫₀¹ t^{1/2 + 2k} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

But this integral inside is similar to the previous I(a, b, c) with a = 1/2 + 2k, b = 1/2, c = 5/2. Which we can express as a hypergeometric function, but again, not helpful.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the integral is zero, but numerical evaluation suggests it's positive. Alternatively, the answer might involve π and log terms. Given the presence of sqrt terms, it's possible that the result is a combination of π and ln 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the original Beta function and its derivatives. Let me recall that the original integral after substitution is:

(1/8) [I4 - 2 ln 2 I3]

If I can express I3 and I4 in terms of derivatives of the Beta function.

Let’s consider I3 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t dt

Let’s define a function J(a) = ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Then, I3 = J’(1/2)

Similarly, I4 = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) dt

This can be written as:

∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t)] dt

= ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 - t) dt + ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} ln t ln(1 + t) dt

Which is I1 + I2 = I4

But I1 and I2 can be expressed as derivatives of J(a) with respect to different parameters.

For example, I1 = ∂²J/(∂a ∂b) evaluated at a=1/2, b=1/2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that J(a) can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function.

J(a) = ∫₀¹ t^a (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} dt

Let’s expand (1 + t)^{5/2} as a binomial series:

(1 + t)^{5/2} = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} t^k

Thus,

J(a) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} ∫₀¹ t^{a + k} (1 - t)^{1/2} dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} B(a + k +1, 3/2)

Where B is the Beta function. Then,

J(a) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} Γ(a + k +1) Γ(3/2)/Γ(a + k + 5/2)

Differentiating J(a) with respect to a:

J’(a) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} [Γ’(a + k +1) Γ(3/2)/Γ(a + k + 5/2) - Γ(a + k +1) Γ(3/2) Γ’(a + k + 5/2)/Γ(a + k + 5/2)^2 ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ \binom{5/2}{k} Γ(3/2) [ψ(a + k +1) - ψ(a + k + 5/2)] B(a + k +1, 3/2)

Where ψ is the digamma function. This seems too complex to evaluate analytically.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to concede that I cannot find an analytical solution and proceed to compute the integral numerically. However, the problem states to compute it analytically first. This suggests that there's a trick or substitution that I'm missing.

Let me revisit the original integral:

∫₀¹ x^{0.5}(1 - x)^{0.5}(2 - x)^{-0.5 - 2×0.5 - 2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) dx

Simplify the exponent of (2 - x):

-0.5 - 2×0.5 - 2 = -0.5 -1 -2 = -3.5 = -7/2

So the integral is:

∫₀¹ sqrt(x) sqrt(1 - x) (2 - x)^{-7/2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) dx

Let me consider another substitution. Let’s set u = 2 - x. Then x = 2 - u, dx = -du. When x=0, u=2; x=1, u=1. So the integral becomes:

∫₂¹ sqrt(2 - u) sqrt(1 - (2 - u)) u^{-7/2} ln((2 - u)/u) ln((u -1)/u^2) (-du)

= ∫₁² sqrt(2 - u) sqrt(u -1) u^{-7/2} ln((2 - u)/u) ln((u -1)/u^2) du

Simplify the terms:

sqrt(2 - u) sqrt(u -1) = sqrt((2 - u)(u -1)) = sqrt(-u² + 3u - 2)

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps substituting u = 1 + t, shifting the interval.

Let u = 1 + t, then when u=1, t=0; u=2, t=1. The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ sqrt(2 - (1 + t)) sqrt(t) (1 + t)^{-7/2} ln((1 - t)/(1 + t)) ln(t/(1 + t)^2) dt

Simplify:

sqrt(1 - t) sqrt(t) (1 + t)^{-7/2} ln((1 - t)/(1 + t)) ln(t/(1 + t)^2) dt

This is similar to the previous substitution, but mirrored. However, this doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand is antisymmetric under a certain transformation. For example, if we let t = 1 - s in the original substitution, but I don't see antisymmetry.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with a numerical approximation. However, the user requires an exact answer. Given the problem's complexity, it's possible that the integral evaluates to zero, but numerical evaluation suggests it's positive. Alternatively, the answer is a simple multiple of π or log terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the Beta function with respect to parameters. Let me recall that:

B(a, b) = ∫₀¹ t^{a-1} (1 - t)^{b-1} dt

And the derivatives of B(a, b) with respect to a or b involve log terms. For example:

∂B(a, b)/∂a = B(a, b) [ψ(a) - ψ(a + b)] ]

But in our case, the integral has additional factors like (1 + t)^{5/2}, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be related to the Beta function multiplied by some constants. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to conclude that I'm unable to find an analytical solution and that the integral likely requires advanced techniques beyond standard calculus, possibly involving hypergeometric functions or their derivatives, which I'm not familiar with in detail.

However, given the problem's requirement for an exact answer, I must have missed a key insight. Let me try one last approach: checking if the integrand is a total derivative.

Suppose we consider the integrand as the derivative of some function. Let’s denote:

F(x) = x^{0.5} (1 - x)^{0.5} (2 - x)^{-3.5} something

Then, dF/dx should equal the integrand. Let’s try to find such F(x).

The integrand is:

sqrt(x) sqrt(1 - x) (2 - x)^{-7/2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2)

This seems highly unlikely to be a perfect derivative, but let's consider if F(x) could be of the form x^{a} (1 - x)^{b} (2 - x)^{c} multiplied by the log terms.

But even if so, differentiating such a product would involve multiple terms due to the product rule, and matching coefficients would be extremely complex.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution and the time I've invested, I'll have to proceed with a numerical approximation for the answer, but the problem explicitly requires an exact answer first. Therefore, I must conclude that I'm currently unable to solve this integral analytically and may need to refer to more advanced methods or resources. However, since the problem requires an answer, I'll provide the numerical approximation as per the user's request, but I'm unable to provide the exact analytical solution at this time.

But the user insists on an exact answer. Given that, perhaps the integral evaluates to zero. However, my numerical samples suggested it's positive. Alternatively, the exact answer might be a simple expression involving π and log terms. For example, perhaps π times a logarithm or something similar.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the derivative of the Beta function with respect to parameters. Let’s recall that:

B(a, b) = ∫₀¹ t^{a-1} (1 - t)^{b-1} dt

And the derivative with respect to a is:

B’(a, b) = B(a, b) [ψ(a) - ψ(a + b)]

But in our case, the integral has additional factors. However, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of these derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is zero. But given the numerical evaluation, I think not. Alternatively, the answer might be -π/2 or similar. But without further insight, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to provide the numerical approximation and state that the exact answer could not be determined. However, the problem requires an exact answer, so I must have missed something.

Wait, let me check the original integrand again. The exponent of (2 - x) is -0.5 - 2×0.5 -2. Let me recalculate:

-0.5 - 2×0.5 -2 = -0.5 -1 -2 = -3.5, which is correct. So (2 - x)^{-7/2}

The integrand is:

sqrt(x) sqrt(1 - x) (2 - x)^{-7/2} ln(x/(2 - x)) ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2)

Let me consider a substitution z = x/(2 - x), which we did earlier. Wait, we already did that substitution. The result after substitution was:

(1/8) ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{5/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

But perhaps there's a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me double-check:

Original substitution t = x/(2 - x) => x = 2t/(1 + t), dx = 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Then, 2 - x = 2/(1 + t), 1 - x = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

The integrand:

sqrt(x) = sqrt(2t/(1 + t)) = sqrt(2t)/sqrt(1 + t)

sqrt(1 - x) = sqrt((1 - t)/(1 + t)) = sqrt(1 - t)/sqrt(1 + t)

(2 - x)^{-7/2} = (2/(1 + t))^{-7/2} = (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2}

The log terms:

ln(x/(2 - x)) = ln(t)

ln((1 - x)/(2 - x)^2) = ln((1 - t)/(1 + t)) - 2 ln(2/(1 + t)) = ln(1 - t) - ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2 + 2 ln(1 + t) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2

So the product of the logs is ln t [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2]

Putting it all together:

sqrt(2t)/sqrt(1 + t) * sqrt(1 - t)/sqrt(1 + t) * (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2} * ln t [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2] * 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Wait, I think I missed the dx term. The substitution gives dx = 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

So the entire integrand after substitution is:

sqrt(2t/(1 + t)) * sqrt((1 - t)/(1 + t)) * (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2} * [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] * 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Let me compute this step by step:

sqrt(2t/(1 + t)) = (2t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2}

sqrt((1 - t)/(1 + t)) = (1 - t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2}

(1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2}

Multiply these terms:

(2t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2} * (1 - t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2} * (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2} * 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Combine the exponents:

2^{1/2} t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} / (1 + t)^{1} * (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2} * 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Simplify the 2 terms:

2^{1/2} / 2^{7/2} * 2 = 2^{1/2 - 7/2 +1} = 2^{-2} = 1/4

Combine (1 + t) exponents:

(1 + t)^{7/2} / (1 + t)^{1 + 2} = (1 + t)^{7/2 - 3} = (1 + t)^{1/2}

So the integrand becomes:

(1/4) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

Wait, this is different from what I had earlier. Previously, I thought the exponent of (1 + t) was 5/2, but now it's 1/2. This suggests a mistake in the previous substitution steps.

Let me recalculate:

Original terms after substitution:

sqrt(x) = sqrt(2t/(1 + t)) = (2t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2}

sqrt(1 - x) = sqrt((1 - t)/(1 + t)) = (1 - t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2}

(2 - x)^{-7/2} = (2/(1 + t))^{-7/2} = (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2}

dx = 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

So multiplying all terms:

(2t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2} * (1 - t)^{1/2}/(1 + t)^{1/2} * (1 + t)^{7/2}/2^{7/2} * 2/(1 + t)^2 * [log terms]

Combine the constants:

2^{1/2} / 2^{7/2} * 2 = 2^{1/2 -7/2 +1} = 2^{-2} = 1/4

Combine the (1 + t) terms:

(1 + t)^{-1/2 -1/2 +7/2 -2} = (1 + t)^{(-1) +7/2 -2} = (1 + t)^{7/2 -3} = (1 + t)^{1/2}

Combine the t and (1 - t) terms:

t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2}

So the integrand is:

(1/4) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

This is different from what I had earlier. Previously, I had (1 + t)^{5/2}, but now it's (1 + t)^{1/2}. This suggests I made a mistake in the exponent calculation earlier.

This changes things. So the correct integrand after substitution is:

(1/4) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

This is a crucial correction. Now, the integrand is:

(1/4) t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2)] dt

This is much simpler. Now, the term (1 + t)^{1/2} combined with t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} gives:

t^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} = t^{1/2} [(1 - t)(1 + t)]^{1/2} = t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2}

So the integrand becomes:

(1/4) t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t²) - 2 ln 2)] dt

This is a lot simpler. So the integral is:

(1/4) ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} [ln t (ln(1 - t²) - 2 ln 2)] dt

This is a significant simplification. Now, split the integral into two parts:

= (1/4) [ ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) dt - 2 ln 2 ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} ln t dt ]

Let’s denote these integrals as I and J:

I = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} ln t ln(1 - t²) dt

J = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} ln t dt

So the original integral is (I - 2 ln 2 J)/4

Now, let's compute I and J.

First, compute J:

J = ∫₀¹ t^{1/2} (1 - t²)^{1/2} ln t dt

Let’s make substitution u = t². Then t = u^{1/2}, dt = (1/2) u^{-1/2} du. When t=0, u=0; t=1, u=1.

J = ∫₀¹ u^{1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} ln u^{1/2} * (1/2) u^{-1/2} du

= (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{-1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} (1/2) ln u du

= (1/4) ∫₀¹ u^{-1/4} (1 - u)^{1/2} ln u du

This is (1/4) times the derivative of the Beta function B(a, b) with respect to a, evaluated at a=3/4, b=3/2.

Recall that:
