Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^{-1} times (2^2 - x^2)^{-1/2} times arctan(x) dx. Hmm, that's ∫₀² [1/(x)] * [1/√(4 - x²)] * arctan(x) dx. Wait, actually, the integrand is (1/x) * (1/√(4 - x²)) * arctan(x). Let me write that down properly.

First, maybe I can simplify the expression. The integrand is arctan(x) divided by x times the square root of (4 - x²). Hmm. Let me check if there's a substitution that can help here. The presence of √(4 - x²) suggests a trigonometric substitution. Maybe let x = 2 sinθ? Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0; x=2, θ=π/2. Let's try that.

Substituting x = 2 sinθ, so θ ranges from 0 to π/2. Then √(4 - x²) becomes √(4 - 4 sin²θ) = 4 cos²θ under the square root, so √(4 cos²θ) = 2 cosθ. Then the integrand becomes:

arctan(2 sinθ) / (2 sinθ) * 1/(2 cosθ) * 2 cosθ dθ. Wait, let's compute each part:

Original integrand: [arctan(x) / x] * [1 / √(4 - x²)] dx

After substitution x=2 sinθ:

arctan(2 sinθ) / (2 sinθ) * 1/(2 cosθ) * 2 cosθ dθ. Let's simplify:

The 2 cosθ in the numerator (from dx) and the denominator 2 cosθ (from √(4 - x²)) will cancel each other. So we have:

[ arctan(2 sinθ) / (2 sinθ) ] * (1/(2 cosθ)) * 2 cosθ dθ = arctan(2 sinθ)/(2 sinθ) * dθ. Wait, no, let's check again:

Wait, dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Then:

1/x = 1/(2 sinθ)

1/√(4 - x²) = 1/(2 cosθ)

So the integrand becomes:

[1/(2 sinθ)] * [1/(2 cosθ)] * arctan(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ dθ

Wait, the 2 cosθ from dx is multiplied here. Wait, no. Wait, the substitution is:

Integral becomes:

arctan(x) / x * 1/√(4 - x²) dx = arctan(2 sinθ)/(2 sinθ) * 1/(2 cosθ) * 2 cosθ dθ

Ah, because dx = 2 cosθ dθ. So the 2 cosθ from dx cancels with the 1/(2 cosθ) from the sqrt term. So the integrand simplifies to arctan(2 sinθ)/(2 sinθ) * dθ. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [arctan(2 sinθ)/sinθ] dθ.

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler. Now, how to handle arctan(2 sinθ)/sinθ. Maybe expand arctan(2 sinθ) as a power series? Or perhaps consider differentiation under the integral sign. Let me think.

Let me denote the integral as I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [arctan(2 sinθ)/sinθ] dθ )

Alternatively, maybe consider substitution t = sinθ, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = arctan(2 sinθ), dv = dθ/sinθ. Then du = [ (2 cosθ)/(1 + (2 sinθ)^2) ] dθ, and v = ∫ dθ/sinθ. Wait, but ∫ dθ/sinθ is ln |tan(θ/2)| + C. Hmm, but integrating by parts here might complicate things. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe consider a substitution. Let’s set t = 2 sinθ. Then when θ=0, t=0; θ=π/2, t=2. Then dt = 2 cosθ dθ. But I'm not sure if that helps. Let's see. Then θ goes from 0 to π/2, t from 0 to 2. Then sinθ = t/2, so θ = arcsin(t/2). Then cosθ dθ = dt/2. Hmm, but maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps expand arctan(2 sinθ) as a power series. The Taylor series for arctan(z) is z - z^3/3 + z^5/5 - z^7/7 + ... for |z| ≤ 1. But 2 sinθ can be up to 2*1=2, so the series for arctan(2 sinθ) would have radius of convergence 1, but at θ=π/2, 2 sinθ=2, which is outside the radius. So maybe that's not valid over the entire interval. Hmm, so that might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps use the integral representation of arctan. Recall that arctan(z) = ∫₀^z [1/(1 + t²)] dt. So maybe we can write arctan(2 sinθ) = ∫₀^{2 sinθ} [1/(1 + t²)] dt. Then interchange the order of integration. Let me try that.

So, I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ ∫₀^{2 sinθ} 1/(1 + t²) dt ] / sinθ dθ

Interchange the integrals. The limits for t would be from 0 to 2 sinθ, and θ from 0 to π/2. So if we switch the order, t goes from 0 to 2, and for a fixed t, θ ranges from arcsin(t/2) to π/2. Wait, because when t is between 0 and 2, 2 sinθ ≥ t implies sinθ ≥ t/2, so θ ≥ arcsin(t/2). So the integral becomes:

I = (1/2) ∫₀² [ ∫_{arcsin(t/2)}^{π/2} 1/(1 + t²) * 1/sinθ dθ ] dt

But 1/(1 + t²) is independent of θ, so we can take that out:

I = (1/2) ∫₀² [1/(1 + t²)] [ ∫_{arcsin(t/2)}^{π/2} 1/sinθ dθ ] dt

Now, compute the inner integral ∫ 1/sinθ dθ. The integral of 1/sinθ dθ is ln |tan(θ/2)| + C. So evaluating from arcsin(t/2) to π/2:

At π/2: tan(π/4) = 1, so ln(1) = 0.

At arcsin(t/2): Let’s denote φ = arcsin(t/2). Then θ = φ, so tan(φ/2). Let’s express tan(φ/2) in terms of t. Since φ = arcsin(t/2), then cosφ = √(1 - (t²/4)). So tan(φ/2) = sinφ/(1 + cosφ) = (t/2)/(1 + √(1 - t²/4)).

Therefore, the inner integral becomes:

ln |tan(π/4)| - ln |tan(φ/2)| = 0 - ln[ (t/2)/(1 + √(1 - t²/4)) ) ] = -ln(t/(2(1 + √(1 - t²/4))) )

So the integral I becomes:

I = (1/2) ∫₀² [1/(1 + t²)] * [ -ln(t/(2(1 + √(1 - t²/4))) ) ] dt

Simplify the negative sign:

I = (1/2) ∫₀² [1/(1 + t²)] * ln(2(1 + √(1 - t²/4))/t ) dt

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can simplify the expression inside the logarithm. Let me see:

Let’s denote the argument of the log as:

2(1 + √(1 - t²/4))/t

Let’s rationalize this expression. Let’s set u = t/2, so t = 2u. Then the expression becomes:

2(1 + √(1 - u²)) / (2u) = (1 + √(1 - u²))/u

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, note that 1 + √(1 - t²/4) over t/2. Wait, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by 1 - √(1 - t²/4):

Wait, let me compute:

Let’s see, 1 + √(1 - t²/4) multiplied by 1 - √(1 - t²/4) is 1 - (1 - t²/4) = t²/4.

So, [1 + √(1 - t²/4)] = [t²/4] / [1 - √(1 - t²/4)]

Therefore, 2(1 + √(1 - t²/4))/t = 2 * [t²/4 / (1 - √(1 - t²/4))] / t = (t/2) / (1 - √(1 - t²/4)) )

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps make substitution for the term inside the log. Let’s set v = √(1 - t²/4). Then v = √(1 - t²/4), so v² = 1 - t²/4, so t² = 4(1 - v²), t dt = -4v dv. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider substitution t = 2 sinφ. Let’s try that. Let t = 2 sinφ, so when t=0, φ=0; t=2, φ=π/2. Then dt = 2 cosφ dφ. Then the integral becomes:

I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(1 + (2 sinφ)^2)] * ln[2(1 + √(1 - (2 sinφ)^2/4))/(2 sinφ) ] * 2 cosφ dφ

Simplify:

The 1/2 and 2 cancel, so:

I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(1 + 4 sin²φ)] * ln[ (1 + √(1 - sin²φ)) / sinφ ] * cosφ dφ

But √(1 - sin²φ) = cosφ, so:

ln[ (1 + cosφ)/sinφ ] = ln( (1 + cosφ)/sinφ )

Recall that (1 + cosφ)/sinφ = cot(φ/2). Because 1 + cosφ = 2 cos²(φ/2), sinφ = 2 sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2), so (1 + cosφ)/sinφ = (2 cos²(φ/2))/(2 sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2)) ) = cot(φ/2). Therefore, ln(cot(φ/2)) = ln(1/tan(φ/2)) = -ln(tan(φ/2)).

So the integral becomes:

I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(1 + 4 sin²φ)] * (-ln(tan(φ/2))) * cosφ dφ

Hmm, this seems a bit more manageable. Let's write that as:

I = - ∫₀^{π/2} [cosφ / (1 + 4 sin²φ)] * ln(tan(φ/2)) dφ

But I'm not sure if this is helpful. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let’s set u = φ/2, so φ = 2u, dφ = 2du. Then the limits from u=0 to u=π/4. Then:

I = - ∫₀^{π/4} [cos(2u) / (1 + 4 sin²(2u))] * ln(tan u) * 2 du

Hmm, but this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps expand ln(tan(φ/2)) in terms of Fourier series or something. Alternatively, maybe consider integrating by parts again. Let’s see.

Let’s denote the integral as:

I = - ∫₀^{π/2} [cosφ / (1 + 4 sin²φ)] * ln(tan(φ/2)) dφ

Let’s set v = ln(tan(φ/2)), dv/dφ = [1/tan(φ/2)] * sec²(φ/2) * (1/2) ) = [1/(sin(φ/2)/cos(φ/2))] * [1/(cos²(φ/2))] * (1/2) ) = [cos(φ/2)/sin(φ/2)] * [1/(cos²(φ/2))] * 1/2 = 1/(2 sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2)) ) = 1/sinφ.

So dv = (1/sinφ) dφ.

Then, let’s set:

u = - [cosφ / (1 + 4 sin²φ)] 

Then du/dφ = - [ -sinφ (1 + 4 sin²φ) - cosφ * 8 sinφ cosφ ] / (1 + 4 sin²φ)^2

Wait, let me compute derivative of u:

u = - cosφ / (1 + 4 sin²φ)

du/dφ = - [ -sinφ (1 + 4 sin²φ) - cosφ * d/dφ (4 sin²φ) ] / (1 + 4 sin²φ)^2

Compute d/dφ (4 sin²φ) = 8 sinφ cosφ.

So:

du/dφ = - [ -sinφ (1 + 4 sin²φ) - cosφ * 8 sinφ cosφ ] / (1 + 4 sin²φ)^2

Simplify numerator:

- sinφ (1 + 4 sin²φ) - 8 sinφ cos²φ

= - sinφ [1 + 4 sin²φ + 8 cos²φ ]

But 4 sin²φ + 8 cos²φ = 4 sin²φ + 8 (1 - sin²φ) = 4 sin²φ + 8 - 8 sin²φ = 8 - 4 sin²φ

So numerator becomes:

- sinφ [1 + 8 - 4 sin²φ ] = - sinφ (9 - 4 sin²φ )

Therefore, du/dφ = - [ - sinφ (9 - 4 sin²φ ) ] / (1 + 4 sin²φ)^2 = [ sinφ (9 - 4 sin²φ ) ] / (1 + 4 sin²φ)^2

So integrating by parts, ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

Thus, I = uv | from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} v du

But uv at π/2: φ=π/2, tan(φ/2)=tan(π/4)=1, so ln(1)=0. So uv is zero. At φ=0, tan(0/2)=0, so ln(0) is -infty, but multiplied by u which is -cos0/(1 + 0) = -1. So we have -1 * (-infty), which is infty. Wait, this suggests that the boundary term might be problematic. Hmm, maybe integrating by parts here isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps this integral is known or can be related to some standard integrals. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe consider substitution z = tan(φ/2). Let’s try that.

Let’s set z = tan(φ/2), so that φ = 2 arctan z, dφ = 2/(1 + z²) dz. When φ=0, z=0; φ=π/2, z=1. Then sinφ = 2z/(1 + z²), cosφ = (1 - z²)/(1 + z²). Let's substitute into the integral:

I = - ∫₀¹ [ ( (1 - z²)/(1 + z²) ) / (1 + 4*(4 z²)/(1 + z²)^2 ) ] * ln(z) * [2/(1 + z²)] dz

Wait, let's compute each part:

cosφ = (1 - z²)/(1 + z²)

1 + 4 sin²φ = 1 + 4*(4 z²)/(1 + z²)^2 = 1 + (16 z²)/(1 + z²)^2 = [ (1 + z²)^2 + 16 z² ] / (1 + z²)^2

= [1 + 2 z² + z^4 + 16 z²] / (1 + z²)^2 = [1 + 18 z² + z^4] / (1 + z²)^2

So the denominator term is 1 + 4 sin²φ = (z^4 + 18 z² + 1)/(1 + z²)^2

Therefore, the integrand becomes:

- [ (1 - z²)/(1 + z²) ) / ( (z^4 + 18 z² + 1)/(1 + z²)^2 ) ) ] * ln(z) * [2/(1 + z²)] dz

Simplify the fractions:

= - [ (1 - z²)(1 + z²)^2 / ( (1 + z²)(z^4 + 18 z² + 1) ) ) ] * ln(z) * 2/(1 + z²) dz

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= - [ (1 - z²)(1 + z²) / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) ) ] * ln(z) * 2/(1 + z²) dz

= - [ (1 - z²) / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) ) ] * ln(z) * 2 dz

So the integral becomes:

I = -2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe there's symmetry here. Let me check the denominator: z^4 + 18 z² + 1. Let’s factor it. Let’s set y = z², so y² + 18 y + 1. The discriminant is 324 - 4 = 320, so roots are y = [-18 ± √320]/2 = [-18 ± 8√5]/2 = -9 ± 4√5. Since z is real and positive, z^4 + 18 z² + 1 is always positive, so denominator doesn't have real roots. So partial fractions might be feasible but complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the integrand is (1 - z²) ln z / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1). Let’s split into two terms:

[1/(z^4 + 18 z² + 1)] * (1 - z²) ln z = [1/(z^4 + 18 z² + 1)] * ln z - [z²/(z^4 + 18 z² + 1)] * ln z

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, consider substitution t = 1/z. Let’s see:

Let t = 1/z, so when z approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and z=1 corresponds to t=1. Then dz = -1/t² dt. Let’s compute the integral from z=0 to z=1 as t=∞ to t=1, and then reverse the limits:

I = -2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz = -2 ∫₁^∞ [ (1 - (1/t²)) ln(1/t) ] / ( (1/t^4) + 18 (1/t²) + 1 ) * (-1/t²) dt

Simplify:

= -2 ∫₁^∞ [ ( (t² - 1)/t² ) * (-ln t) ] / ( (1 + 18 t² + t^4)/t^4 ) * ( -1/t² ) dt

Wait, let's compute each part:

(1 - z²) = 1 - 1/t² = (t² - 1)/t²

ln z = ln(1/t) = -ln t

Denominator: z^4 + 18 z² + 1 = (1/t^4) + 18 (1/t²) + 1 = (1 + 18 t² + t^4)/t^4

So the integrand becomes:

[ (t² - 1)/t² * (-ln t) ] / [ (1 + 18 t² + t^4)/t^4 ] * (-1/t²) dt

Multiply all terms:

= [ (t² - 1)(-ln t) / t² ] * [ t^4 / (1 + 18 t² + t^4) ] * (-1/t²) dt

= [ (t² - 1)(-ln t) * t^4 * (-1) ] / [ t² * (1 + 18 t² + t^4) * t² ] dt

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (t² - 1)(-ln t)(-1) t^4 = (t² - 1) ln t t^4

Denominator: t² * t² * (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) = t^4 (t^4 + 18 t² + 1)

So the integrand becomes:

[ (t² - 1) ln t t^4 ] / [ t^4 (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) ] dt = [ (t² - 1) ln t ] / (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) dt

Therefore, the integral becomes:

I = -2 ∫₁^∞ [ (t² - 1) ln t ] / (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) dt

But notice that the original integral I was:

I = -2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz

And after substitution, we have:

I = -2 ∫₁^∞ [ (t² - 1) ln t ] / (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) dt

If we add these two expressions for I, we get:

2I = -2 [ ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz + ∫₁^∞ [ (t² - 1) ln t ] / (t^4 + 18 t² + 1) dt ]

But notice that in the second integral, (t² - 1) is similar to -(1 - t²) when t <1, but here t >1. However, if we make substitution t = z in the second integral, it's from 1 to ∞. Let’s split the second integral into two parts: from 1=1 to t=∞. Let’s see:

But perhaps adding the two integrals:

Let’s consider the integral from 0 to ∞:

∫₀^∞ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz

But the original I is from 0 to1, and the other part is from1 to ∞. So:

∫₀^∞ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz = ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz + ∫₁^∞ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz

But in the second integral, substitute z = 1/t, then dz = -1/t² dt, and when z=1, t=1; z=∞, t=0. Then:

∫₁^∞ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz = ∫₀¹ [ (1 - 1/t²) (-ln t) ] / (1/t^4 + 18/t² + 1) * (-1/t²) dt

Wait, this seems similar to the previous substitution. Let’s compute:

= ∫₀¹ [ ( (t² -1)/t² ) (-ln t) ] / ( (1 + 18 t² + t^4)/t^4 ) * (-1/t²) dt

= ∫₀¹ [ (t² -1)(-ln t)/t² ] * [ t^4/(1 + 18 t² + t^4) ] * (-1/t²) dt

= ∫₀¹ [ (t² -1)(-ln t) t^4 ] / [ t² (1 + 18 t² + t^4) t² ] dt

= ∫₀¹ [ (t² -1)(-ln t) t^4 ] / [ t^4 (1 + 18 t² + t^4) ] dt

= ∫₀¹ [ (t² -1)(-ln t) ] / (1 + 18 t² + t^4) dt

= ∫₀¹ [ (1 - t²) ln t ] / (1 + 18 t² + t^4) dt

So the integral from 1 to ∞ is equal to the integral from 0 to1 of [ (1 - t²) ln t ] / (1 + 18 t² + t^4) dt. Therefore, the original integral from 0 to ∞ is:

∫₀^∞ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz = ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz + ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz = 2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz

But from earlier, we have:

2I = -2 [ ∫₀¹ ... + ∫₁^∞ ... ] = -2 * [ ∫₀^∞ ... ] = -2 * 2 ∫₀¹ ... = -4 ∫₀¹ ...

But this seems like it's getting more involved. Maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me think. The denominator z^4 + 18 z² + 1 is a palindromic polynomial. Let’s check: z^4 + 18 z² + 1. If we reverse the coefficients, it's the same. So it's a reciprocal polynomial. Therefore, if we substitute z = 1/t, the denominator becomes t^4 + 18 t² + 1, same as original. So perhaps this suggests that the integral from 0 to1 and 1 to ∞ are related.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe consider that the function is odd or even in some substitution. Alternatively, perhaps consider integrating over the entire real line. But since z is from 0 to ∞, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let’s define a parameter in the integral. Let’s think: the original integral after substitution became I = -2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] / (z^4 + 18 z² + 1) dz. Let’s denote this as -2 ∫₀¹ f(z) dz. Maybe we can relate this to a known integral.

Alternatively, perhaps consider contour integration. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, look up integrals involving rational functions and logarithms. Alternatively, consider that the denominator factors as (z^2 + a)(z^2 + b), but let’s check:

z^4 + 18 z² + 1. Let’s try to factor it. Let’s set y = z², so y² + 18 y + 1. The discriminant is 324 - 4 = 320, so roots are y = [-18 ± √320]/2 = [-18 ± 8√5]/2 = -9 ± 4√5. So the factors are (z² + 9 - 4√5)(z² + 9 + 4√5). Therefore, denominator factors as (z² + a)(z² + b) where a = 9 - 4√5 and b = 9 + 4√5.

So, z^4 + 18 z² + 1 = (z² + a)(z² + b), where a = 9 - 4√5, b = 9 + 4√5.

Therefore, we can write 1/(z^4 + 18 z² + 1) = [1/(b - a)] [1/(z² + a) - 1/(z² + b)]

Since b - a = (9 + 4√5) - (9 - 4√5) = 8√5.

So:

1/(z^4 + 18 z² + 1) = 1/(8√5) [1/(z² + a) - 1/(z² + b)]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

I = -2 ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z²) ln z ] * 1/(8√5) [1/(z² + a) - 1/(z² + b) ] dz

= -2/(8√5) ∫₀¹ (1 - z²) ln z [1/(z² + a) - 1/(z² + b) ] dz

= -1/(4√5) [ ∫₀¹ (1 - z²) ln z / (z² + a) dz - ∫₀¹ (1 - z²) ln z / (z² + b) dz ]

Let’s compute each integral separately. Let’s denote:

J(c) = ∫₀¹ (1 - z²) ln z / (z² + c) dz

Then I = -1/(4√5) [ J(a) - J(b) ]

So we need to compute J(a) and J(b). Let’s compute J(c):

J(c) = ∫₀¹ (1 - z²) ln z / (z² + c) dz

Let’s split the numerator:

= ∫₀¹ [ (1 + c - c - z²) ln z / (z² + c) ] dz

= ∫₀¹ [ ( (1 + c) - (z² + c) ) ln z / (z² + c) ] dz

= ∫₀¹ [ (1 + c)/(z² + c) - 1 ] ln z dz

= (1 + c) ∫₀¹ [ ln z / (z² + c) ] dz - ∫₀¹ ln z dz

Compute the second integral first: ∫₀¹ ln z dz = [z ln z - z]₀¹ = (0 - 1) - (0 - 0) = -1

So J(c) = (1 + c) ∫₀¹ [ ln z / (z² + c) ] dz + 1

Now, need to compute ∫₀¹ [ ln z / (z² + c) ] dz. Let’s denote this as K(c).

K(c) = ∫₀¹ ln z / (z² + c) dz

To compute K(c), perhaps differentiate with respect to c. Let’s consider:

dK/dc = - ∫₀¹ ln z / (z² + c)^2 dz

But not sure. Alternatively, integrate by parts. Let’s set u = ln z, dv = dz/(z² + c). Then du = (1/z) dz, v = (1/√c) arctan(z/√c) )

Wait, integral of 1/(z² + c) dz is (1/√c) arctan(z/√c). So:

K(c) = uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du

= [ ln z * (1/√c) arctan(z/√c) ]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (1/√c) arctan(z/√c) * (1/z) dz

At z=1: ln 1 = 0, so first term is 0. At z=0: ln z approaches -infty, but arctan(0) = 0, so the product is 0. So the first term is 0.

Thus, K(c) = - (1/√c) ∫₀¹ [ arctan(z/√c) / z ] dz

Hmm, this seems similar to the original integral we were trying to compute. Not helpful. Alternatively, expand arctan(z/√c) as a power series.

Recall that arctan(t) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n t^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |t| ≤1. So, arctan(z/√c) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (z^{2n+1})/( (√c)^{2n+1} (2n+1) ) )

Thus, K(c) = - (1/√c) ∫₀¹ [ Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n} / ( (√c)^{2n+1} (2n+1) ) ) ] dz

Interchange sum and integral:

= - (1/√c) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / ( (√c)^{2n+1} (2n+1) ) ) ] ∫₀¹ z^{2n} dz

Integrate z^{2n} from 0 to1: 1/(2n+1)

Thus,

K(c) = - (1/√c) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / ( (√c)^{2n+1} (2n+1) ) ) * 1/(2n+1) ) ]

= - (1/√c) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / ( (c^{n + 0.5}) (2n+1)^2 ) ) ]

= - Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / ( c^{n +1} (2n+1)^2 ) ) ]

Hmm, this is an infinite series, which might not be helpful for an exact solution. Perhaps there's a closed-form expression for this series. Alternatively, consider specific values of c. But since a and b are specific constants (9 ±4√5), maybe this series can be summed in terms of known functions for those values. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the original integral I can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can relate this integral to the original problem. But I'm stuck here.

Wait, going back to the original problem. The integral is from 0 to2 of [arctan(x)/x] * [1/√(4 -x²)] dx. Maybe there's a different substitution. Let me try substitution: x = 2 sinθ, which we did earlier, leading to I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} arctan(2 sinθ)/sinθ dθ. Maybe consider expanding arctan(2 sinθ) into a series.

As mentioned before, the Taylor series for arctan(z) is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k+1}/(2k+1) for |z| ≤1. But 2 sinθ can be up to 2, which is outside the radius of convergence. However, perhaps integrate term-by-term and see if it converges.

Let’s write arctan(2 sinθ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (2 sinθ)^{2k+1}/(2k+1). Then:

I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (2 sinθ)^{2k+1}/(2k+1) ] / sinθ dθ

= (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k+1}/(2k+1) ] ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}θ dθ

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}θ dθ is known as the Wallis integral, which is (π/2) ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 )

So:

I = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k+1}/(2k+1) ] * (π/2) ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 )

Simplify the terms:

2^{2k+1} / 4^k = 2^{2k} * 2 / 2^{2k} = 2

So each term becomes:

(-1)^k * 2 / (2k+1) * (π/2) * ( (2k)! ) / ( (k!)^2 )

Thus:

I = (1/2) * π/2 * 2 * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) * ( (2k)! ) / (k!^2 ) ]

= (π/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) * ( (2k)! ) / (k!^2 ) ]

But (2k)! / (k!^2 ) is the central binomial coefficient, which is 4^k / sqrt(π k) asymptotically, but not sure. Alternatively, recognize that (2k)!/(k!^2) = C(2k, k). So:

I = (π/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k+1) * C(2k, k) ]

But I'm not sure if this series converges to a known function. Alternatively, perhaps relate it to the generating function for central binomial coefficients. The generating function for C(2k, k) is 1/√(1 - 4x). But with alternating signs and divided by (2k+1), it might relate to an integral of the generating function.

Let’s consider Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k C(2k, k) x^{2k+1}/(2k+1). If we differentiate this with respect to x, we get Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k C(2k, k) x^{2k} = 1/√(1 +4x²). Because Σ_{k=0}^∞ C(2k, k) (-x²)^k = 1/√(1 +4x²). So integrating 1/√(1 +4x²) from 0 to x gives the original series.

Therefore, Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k C(2k, k) x^{2k+1}/(2k+1) ] = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 +4t²) dt = (1/2) sinh^{-1}(2t) evaluated from 0 to x, which is (1/2) sinh^{-1}(2x). But sinh^{-1}(z) = ln(z + √(z² +1)), so:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k C(2k, k) x^{2k+1}/(2k+1) ] = (1/2) ln(2x + √(4x² +1))

But in our case, the series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k C(2k, k) / (2k+1) ] which corresponds to x=1. So:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k C(2k, k) / (2k+1) ] = (1/2) ln(2*1 + √(4*1 +1)) = (1/2) ln(2 + √5)

Therefore, I = (π/2) * (1/2) ln(2 + √5) = (π/4) ln(2 + √5)

So the exact value of the integral is π/4 times ln(2 + √5).

Now, the numerical approximation. Let's calculate 2 + √5 ≈ 2 + 2.2360679775 ≈ 4.2360679775. Then ln(4.2360679775) ≈ 1.4436354751. Then multiply by π/4: π ≈ 3.1415926536, so 3.1415926536 /4 ≈ 0.7853981634. Then 0.7853981634 * 1.4436354751 ≈ 0.7853981634 * 1.4436354751 ≈ let's compute:

1.4436354751 * 0.7853981634:

First, 1 * 0.7854 = 0.7854

0.4 * 0.7854 = 0.31416

0.04 * 0.7854 = 0.031416

0.003 * 0.7854 = 0.0023562

0.0006354751 * 0.7854 ≈ 0.000635 * 0.7854 ≈ 0.0005

Adding up: 0.7854 + 0.31416 = 1.09956; +0.031416 = 1.130976; +0.0023562 = 1.1333322; +0.0005 ≈ 1.1338322. So approximately 1.1338322. But this seems off. Wait, perhaps using a calculator:

Compute ln(2 + √5):

√5 ≈ 2.2360679775

2 + √5 ≈ 4.2360679775

ln(4.2360679775) ≈ 1.443635475178

π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634

Multiply: 1.443635475178 * 0.7853981634 ≈

Let’s compute:

1.443635475178 * 0.7853981634

Break it down:

1 * 0.7853981634 = 0.7853981634

0.4 * 0.7853981634 = 0.3141592653

0.04 * 0.7853981634 = 0.0314159265

0.003 * 0.7853981634 = 0.0023561945

0.000635475178 * 0.7853981634 ≈ 0.000635475178 * 0.7854 ≈ 0.0005

Adding up:

0.7853981634 + 0.3141592653 = 1.0995574287

+0.0314159265 = 1.1309733552

+0.0023561945 = 1.1333295497

+0.0005 ≈ 1.1338295497

So approximately 1.13383. But let me check with a calculator:

Using a calculator, ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ≈ ln(4.2360679775) ≈ 1.443635475

Multiply by π/4: 1.443635475 * 0.7853981634 ≈ 1.133833037

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.1338330370
