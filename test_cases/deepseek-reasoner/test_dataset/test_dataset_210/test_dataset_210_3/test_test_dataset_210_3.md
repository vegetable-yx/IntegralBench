Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x²) times ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/x] times arcsin²(x) dx. Hmm, that looks pretty complicated. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the integral again to make sure I have it right:

∫₀¹ (1/x²) * ln[(1 + √(1 - x²)) / x] * (arcsin x)² dx.

Alright, so the integrand has three parts: 1/x², a logarithm term, and the square of arcsin x. Each of these could be tricky on their own, but combined, this seems challenging. Let me think about possible approaches.

Maybe substitution? Let's see. The presence of arcsin x suggests that a substitution involving trigonometric functions might be useful. Let me try substituting t = arcsin x. Then x = sin t, and dx = cos t dt. Also, when x = 0, t = 0, and when x = 1, t = π/2. Let's see how the integral transforms.

First, substitute x = sin t, so dx = cos t dt. Then, the limits are from 0 to π/2. Let's rewrite each part:

1/x² becomes 1/(sin² t).

The logarithm term: ln[(1 + √(1 - x²))/x]. Since x = sin t, √(1 - x²) = cos t. So the argument of the log becomes (1 + cos t)/sin t. Let me simplify that. 

(1 + cos t)/sin t. There's a trigonometric identity for 1 + cos t: 1 + cos t = 2 cos²(t/2). And sin t = 2 sin(t/2) cos(t/2). So substituting these in:

(2 cos²(t/2)) / (2 sin(t/2) cos(t/2)) ) = cos(t/2) / sin(t/2) = cot(t/2). Therefore, the logarithm term becomes ln(cot(t/2)).

Also, arcsin x is t, so (arcsin x)² is t².

Putting it all together, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [1/sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) * t² * cos t dt.

Wait, let's check the substitution again. The original integral is (1/x²) * ln(...) * (arcsin x)^2 dx. After substitution, dx = cos t dt, so the integral becomes:

(1/sin² t) * ln(cot(t/2)) * t² * cos t dt.

So combining terms, that's [cos t / sin² t] * t² * ln(cot(t/2)) dt. Let me write that as:

∫₀^{π/2} t² * [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Hmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe simplifying the integrand further. Let's see.

First, note that cot(t/2) = [cos(t/2)] / [sin(t/2)], so ln(cot(t/2)) = ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2)). Alternatively, maybe express cot(t/2) in terms of other trigonometric functions. Also, cot(t/2) = (1 + cos t)/sin t, which is the same as the original expression. Wait, maybe there's a way to express ln(cot(t/2)) in terms of hyperbolic functions or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me consider u = t/2, so t = 2u, dt = 2du. Then the limits go from 0 to π/4. Let's see if that helps. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/4} (2u)² * [cos(2u) / sin²(2u)] * ln(cot u) * 2 du.

Wait, that might not be helpful. Let me compute:

t = 2u, so t² = 4u²), cos t = cos(2u), sin t = sin(2u). Then [cos t / sin² t] = cos(2u) / sin²(2u). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/4} 4u² * [cos(2u)/sin²(2u)] * ln(cot u) * 2 du.

Hmm, that's 8 ∫₀^{π/4} u² * [cos(2u)/sin²(2u)] * ln(cot u) du. Not sure if that's better. Maybe another substitution. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. The integrand has t², which when differentiated, becomes 2t, and integrating the other parts. But the other parts are [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)). That seems messy. Let me see.

Let me denote:

Let’s set u = t², dv = [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Then du = 2t dt, and v would be the integral of [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt. But integrating dv seems difficult. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe switch the order. Let me set u = ln(cot(t/2)), dv = t² [cos t / sin² t] dt. Then du would be derivative of ln(cot(t/2)) with respect to t, and v would be integral of t² [cos t / sin² t] dt. Hmm, still complicated.

Wait, let's compute du. Let me compute derivative of ln(cot(t/2)).

Let’s compute d/dt [ln(cot(t/2))] = derivative of ln(cot(t/2)) = (1/cot(t/2)) * (-csc²(t/2)) * (1/2) = - (1/2) [sin(t/2)/cos(t/2)] * [1 / sin²(t/2)] = - (1/2) [1 / (cos(t/2) sin(t/2))] = - (1/2) [2 / sin t] = -1 / sin t.

Wait, that's a nice simplification! So d/dt [ln(cot(t/2))] = -1/sin t. That's helpful.

So if we set u = ln(cot(t/2)), then du = -1/sin t dt. And dv = t² [cos t / sin² t] dt. Let's see:

dv = t² [cos t / sin² t] dt = t² [cos t / sin² t] dt. Let me write that as t² * cos t / sin² t dt.

So integrating dv would give v. Let's try integrating dv:

v = ∫ t² * (cos t / sin² t) dt.

Hmm, integrating t² * (cos t / sin² t) dt. Let's see. Let me make substitution here. Let’s set w = sin t, then dw = cos t dt. But we have t² / sin² t * cos t dt. So that's t² / w² dw. But integrating t² / w² dw is not straightforward because t is a function of w. Hmm, maybe integration by parts again.

Let me consider integrating t² * (cos t / sin² t) dt. Let me write this as t² * (d/dt (-1/sin t)) dt. Because derivative of (-1/sin t) is cos t / sin² t. So integrating by parts:

∫ t² * d/dt (-1/sin t) dt = t² (-1/sin t) - ∫ (-1/sin t) * 2t dt = - t² / sin t + 2 ∫ t / sin t dt.

So now, v = - t² / sin t + 2 ∫ t / sin t dt.

But now we need to compute ∫ t / sin t dt. Hmm, that's another integral. Let me think. ∫ t csc t dt. Integration by parts again. Let’s set u = t, dv = csc t dt. Then du = dt, and v = -ln |cot t + csc t|, but that's complicated. Wait, the integral of csc t dt is ln |tan(t/2)| + C. So ∫ csc t dt = ln(tan(t/2)) + C. So then, integrating by parts:

∫ t csc t dt = t ln(tan(t/2)) - ∫ ln(tan(t/2)) dt.

Hmm, but this seems to lead to a more complicated integral. Maybe not helpful. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps express 1/sin t as 1/(2 sin(t/2) cos(t/2)) = (1/2) sec(t/2) csc(t/2). Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution. Let me set u = t, dv = csc t dt. Then v = ln |tan(t/2)|. So:

∫ t csc t dt = t ln(tan(t/2)) - ∫ ln(tan(t/2)) dt.

But the remaining integral ∫ ln(tan(t/2)) dt is non-trivial. Let me see. Let’s substitute s = t/2, so t = 2s, dt = 2ds. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫ ln(tan s) ds. The integral of ln(tan s) ds is known? Let me recall. The integral of ln(tan s) ds from 0 to π/4 is related to the Catalan constant, but here the limits would be from 0 to t/2. Hmm, not sure. Maybe this path is not the best.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different substitution or approach.

Wait, going back to the original integral after substitution:

∫₀^{π/2} t² * [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

We found that the derivative of ln(cot(t/2)) is -1/sin t. Maybe integrating by parts with u = t² and dv = [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt. Wait, but earlier I considered u as the log term. Let me try switching.

Let me set u = t², dv = [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Then du = 2t dt, and v = ∫ [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt. But integrating dv is still difficult. Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts with u = ln(cot(t/2)) and dv = t² [cos t / sin² t] dt. Then du = -1/sin t dt, and v = ?

But earlier, we saw that integrating dv leads to an expression involving ∫ t / sin t dt, which is complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me think about the original integrand. Let's see:

Original integral after substitution is:

∫₀^{π/2} t² * [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Let me try to express everything in terms of t/2. Let’s = t/2. Then t = 2ss, dt = 2 dss. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/4} (2ss)² * [cos(2ss) / sin²(2ss)] * ln(cot(ss)) * 2 dss.

Simplify:

4ss² * [cos(2ss)/sin²(2ss)] * ln(cot(ss)) * 2 dss.

So 8 ∫₀^{π/4} ss² * [cos(2ss)/sin²(2ss)] * ln(cot(ss)) dss.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let me compute cos(2ss)/sin²(2ss). cos(2ss) = 1 - 2 sin² ss, and sin(2ss) = 2 sin ss cos ss. So sin²(2ss) = 4 sin² ss cos² ss. Then cos(2ss)/sin²(2ss) = (1 - 2 sin² ss)/(4 sin² ss cos² ss). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = ss, but not helpful. Maybe this path is not leading anywhere.

Let me think of another approach. The original integral is from 0 to 1 of (1/x²) ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/x] (arcsin x)^2 dx.

Another idea: expand the logarithm term. Let's see:

ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/x] = ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x²)) - ln x.

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (arcsin x)^2 / x² [ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x²)) - ln x] dx.

Maybe split into two integrals:

I = ∫₀¹ (arcsin x)^2 / x² ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x²)) dx - ∫₀¹ (arcsin x)^2 / x² ln x dx.

But not sure if that helps. Let me check if either of these integrals is more manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps expand the logarithm as a series. Let me see. For ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x²)) - ln x. Let me see:

ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/x] = ln(1 + sqrt(1 - x²)) - ln x.

But sqrt(1 - x²) = cos(arcsin x) = cos t, where t = arcsin x. So maybe express everything in terms of t. Wait, we already did substitution t = arcsin x earlier. Maybe that's the way to go.

Wait, let's go back to the substitution t = arcsin x. Then x = sin t, dx = cos t dt, and the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [1/sin² t] * ln[(1 + cos t)/sin t] * t² * cos t dt.

Which simplifies to:

∫₀^{π/2} t² * [cos t / sin² t] * ln[(1 + cos t)/sin t] dt.

Wait, but (1 + cos t)/sin t = cot(t/2), as we saw before. So ln(cot(t/2)) = ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2)).

Alternatively, maybe express (1 + cos t)/sin t as 2 cos²(t/2) / (2 sin(t/2) cos(t/2)) ) = cot(t/2). So that's the same as before.

Hmm. Maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t/2. Then t = 2u, dt = 2du. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/4} (2u)² * [cos(2u)/sin²(2u)] * ln(cot u) * 2 du.

Which is 8 ∫₀^{π/4} u² * [cos(2u)/sin²(2u)] * ln(cot u) du.

But this still doesn't seem helpful. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps consider expanding the logarithm term. Let's see:

ln(cot(t/2)) = ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2)).

But maybe express this in terms of hypergeometric functions or series expansions. Alternatively, recall that ln(cot(t/2)) = ln( (1 + cos t)/sin t ). Wait, maybe use the identity that ln( (1 + cos t)/sin t ) = ln( cot(t/2) ) = -ln(tan(t/2)).

Alternatively, perhaps use the logarithm's series. For example, ln(cot(t/2)) = ln(1/tan(t/2)) = -ln(tan(t/2)). But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, recall that tan(t/2) = (1 - cos t)/sin t, so ln(cot(t/2)) = ln(1 / tan(t/2)) = -ln(tan(t/2)) = -ln( (1 - cos t)/sin t ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe express the integrand in terms of t and use integration by parts with the substitution we found earlier where the derivative of ln(cot(t/2)) is -1/sin t.

Let me try integrating by parts again. Let’s set:

u = t², dv = [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Then du = 2t dt, and v = ∫ [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

But integrating dv is still difficult. Wait, but we know that d/dt [ln(cot(t/2))] = -1/sin t. Maybe integrate by parts again on dv.

Let me consider the integral for v:

v = ∫ [cos t / sin² t] * ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Let me set w = ln(cot(t/2)), dw = -1/sin t dt.

Then, dv = [cos t / sin² t] * w dt = [cos t / sin² t] w dt.

Let me write this as derivative of something. Let me note that d/dt [1/sin t] = -cos t / sin² t. So, [cos t / sin² t] dt = -d(1/sin t).

Therefore, v = ∫ w * (-d(1/sin t)) = - w / sin t + ∫ (1/sin t) dw.

But dw = -1/sin t dt, so:

v = - w / sin t - ∫ (1/sin t) * (1/sin t) dt = - w / sin t - ∫ 1/sin² t dt.

Wait, let's compute that:

v = - [ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t] - ∫ csc² t dt.

The integral of csc² t dt is -cot t + C. So:

v = - [ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t] + cot t + C.

Therefore, going back to the integration by parts:

Original integral I = ∫₀^{π/2} t² [cos t / sin² t] ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Using integration by parts with u = t², dv = [cos t / sin² t] ln(cot(t/2)) dt, we have:

I = u*v |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v * du.

First, compute u*v at the limits:

At t = π/2: u = (π/2)², v = - [ln(cot(π/4)) / sin(π/2)] + cot(π/2). But cot(π/4) = 1, so ln(1) = 0. sin(π/2) = 1. cot(π/2) = 0. So v at π/2 is -0/1 + 0 = 0.

At t = 0: u = 0² = 0, and v = - [ln(cot(0)) / sin 0] + cot 0. But cot(0) is infinity, so ln(cot(0)) is ln(inf) which is infinity. But sin(0) = 0, so we have an indeterminate form. However, since u = 0 at t = 0, the term u*v at 0 is 0 * something, which might be 0. Let's assume that the boundary term is 0.

Therefore, I = 0 - ∫₀^{π/2} [ - [ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t] + cot t ] * 2t dt.

Simplify:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t - cot t ] t dt.

So:

I = 2 [ ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t dt - ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt ].

Let me compute these two integrals separately. Let's denote:

A = ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t dt,

B = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt.

So I = 2(A - B).

First, compute integral B: ∫ t cot t dt from 0 to π/2.

Integral of t cot t dt. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = t, dv = cot t dt. Then du = dt, v = ln(sin t). So:

B = t ln(sin t) |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin t) dt.

At t = π/2: t ln(sin π/2) = π/2 * ln(1) = 0.

At t = 0: t ln(sin t) approaches 0 * (-infty), which is 0 (since sin t ~ t, so ln(sin t) ~ ln t, and t ln t approaches 0 as t→0+).

Therefore, B = - ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin t) dt.

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin t) dt is a known integral. It equals - (π/2) ln 2. So:

B = - (- (π/2) ln 2 ) = (π/2) ln 2.

Now, integral A: ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t dt.

Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set u = t/2, so t = 2u, dt = 2du. Then when t = 0, u = 0; t = π/2, u = π/4.

So A becomes:

∫₀^{π/4} 2u * ln(cot u) / sin(2u) * 2 du.

Wait, sin(2u) = 2 sin u cos u, so 1/sin(2u) = 1/(2 sin u cos u). Therefore:

A = ∫₀^{π/4} 2u * ln(cot u) * [1/(2 sin u cos u)] * 2 du.

Simplify:

The 2u * 2 / (2 sin u cos u) = 2u / (sin u cos u). So:

A = ∫₀^{π/4} [2u / (sin u cos u)] * ln(cot u) du.

But cot u = cos u / sin u, so ln(cot u) = ln(cos u) - ln(sin u). Let me split the integral:

A = ∫₀^{π/4} [2u / (sin u cos u)] (ln(cos u) - ln(sin u)) du.

= 2 ∫₀^{π/4} u / (sin u cos u) (ln(cos u) - ln(sin u)) du.

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Let me see if I can simplify the expression.

Note that 1/(sin u cos u) = 2 / sin(2u). So:

A = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} u * 2 / sin(2u) (ln(cos u) - ln(sin u)) du.

= 4 ∫₀^{π/4} u / sin(2u) (ln(cos u) - ln(sin u)) du.

Not sure. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me set v = u. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, express in terms of t = 2u. Let me try that. Let t = 2u, so u = t/2, du = dt/2. When u = 0, t = 0; u = π/4, t = π/2.

Then A becomes:

4 ∫₀^{π/2} (t/2) / sin t (ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2))) * (dt/2).

Simplify:

4 * (1/2) * (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} t / sin t [ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2))] dt.

= ∫₀^{π/2} t / sin t [ln(cos(t/2)) - ln(sin(t/2))] dt.

Hmm, this seems to bring us back to a similar integral. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express ln(cos u) - ln(sin u) = ln(cot u). So:

A = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} [u / (sin u cos u)] ln(cot u) du.

But this is the same as before. Maybe another substitution. Let me set w = cot u. Then u = arccot w, du = -1/(1 + w²) dw. When u = 0, w = ∞; u = π/4, w = 1.

So A becomes:

2 ∫_{∞}^{1} [ arccot w / (sin(arccot w) cos(arccot w)) ] * ln w * (-1/(1 + w²)) dw.

= 2 ∫₁^{∞} [ arccot w / (sin(arccot w) cos(arccot w)) ] * ln w * (1/(1 + w²)) dw.

But sin(arccot w) = 1/√(1 + w²), cos(arccot w) = w/√(1 + w²). Therefore:

sin(arccot w) cos(arccot w) = (1/√(1 + w²)) * (w/√(1 + w²)) = w/(1 + w²).

So the denominator sin u cos u = w/(1 + w²). Therefore:

A = 2 ∫₁^{∞} [ arccot w / (w/(1 + w²)) ] * ln w * (1/(1 + w²)) dw.

Simplify:

= 2 ∫₁^{∞} arccot w * (1 + w²)/w * ln w * 1/(1 + w²) dw.

= 2 ∫₁^{∞} (arccot w * ln w) / w dw.

= 2 ∫₁^{∞} (arccot w * ln w) / w dw.

Hmm, this seems more manageable. Let me make substitution z = 1/w. Let z = 1/w, so when w = 1, z = 1; w = ∞, z = 0. Then dw = -1/z² dz.

So the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀¹ arccot(1/z) * ln(1/z) / (1/z) * (-1/z²) dz.

Simplify:

arccot(1/z) = arctan z. Because arccot(x) = arctan(1/x). So arccot(1/z) = arctan z.

ln(1/z) = -ln z.

So substituting:

2 ∫₀¹ arctan z * (-ln z) / (1/z) * (-1/z²) dz.

Let's compute step by step:

First, the integrand:

arctan z) * (-ln z) / (1/z) * (-1/z²) = arctan z * (-ln z) * z * (-1/z²) = arctan z * ln z * (1/z).

So the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀¹ (arctan z * ln z) / z dz.

= 2 ∫₀¹ (arctan z * ln z) / z dz.

Hmm, this integral might be known or perhaps can be expressed in terms of series.

Let me recall that arctan z can be expressed as a power series: arctan z = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |z| ≤ 1.

So, substituting this into the integral:

2 ∫₀¹ [ Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1) ] * ln z / z dz.

= 2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀¹ z^{2n} ln z dz.

The integral ∫₀¹ z^{2n} ln z dz is a standard integral. Let me compute it.

Let’s set I = ∫₀¹ z^{a} ln z dz. Integration by parts: let u = ln z, dv = z^a dz. Then du = (1/z) dz, v = z^{a+1}/(a+1). So:

I = uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [z^{a+1}/(a+1) * ln z]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ z^{a+1}/(a+1) * (1/z) dz.

At z=1: z^{a+1}/(a+1) * ln 1 = 0.

At z=0: limit as z→0+ of z^{a+1} ln z / (a+1). If a+1 > 0, which it is here since a = 2n ≥ 0, then z^{a+1} approaches 0 and ln z approaches -infty, but the product tends to 0 (since z^{a+1} dominates). So the first term is 0.

Then, I = - ∫₀¹ z^{a}/(a+1) dz = -1/(a+1) * [ z^{a+1}/(a+1) ]₀¹ = -1/(a+1)^2.

Therefore, ∫₀¹ z^{2n} ln z dz = -1/(2n + 1)^2.

So returning to the series:

A = 2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * (-1)/(2n + 1)^2) = 2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} / (2n + 1)^3.

So A = -2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^3.

But Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^3 is known as β(3), where β is the Dirichlet beta function. The value of β(3) is π³/32. Wait, let me check.

Actually, the Dirichlet beta function is defined as β(s) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^s. For s=3, β(3) is known as Catalan's constant. Wait, no, Catalan's constant is β(2). Wait, no:

Catalan's constant is G = β(2) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^2 ≈ 0.915965594...

But for β(3), the value is known but not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, there are some known results. Wait, but I might be mistaken. Let me check.

Wait, β(3) is a known constant, but I think it's not be expressed in terms of π or other elementary terms. However, there might be a relation here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection with the integral we're computing.

But according to some references, β(3) = π³/32. Wait, let me verify:

Wait, no, β(1) = π/4, β(2) = Catalan's constant, β(3) is another constant. For example, β(2n+1) can be expressed in terms of the Euler numbers and π^{2n+1}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate this series to the original integral. But given that A = -2 * Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^3 = -2 β(3). But I need to find the value of β(3). Let me check if there's a known value.

Upon checking, β(3) is known as the Catalan's constant for order 3, but it's actually a different constant. The value of β(3) is approximately 0.9689461463. However, exact value is not known in terms of elementary functions. Wait, but maybe in this case, the series can be summed up in terms of π^3 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection with the integral we're trying to solve. Let me recall that the original integral I = 2(A - B), where B = (π/2) ln 2. If A is expressed in terms of β(3), then I = 2(-2 β(3) - (π/2) ln 2) = -4 β(3) - π ln 2. But this seems to lead to a result involving β(3), which is a non-elementary constant. However, the problem states that we need to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. So perhaps there's a way to express β(3) in terms of other constants here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the process. Let me retrace the steps.

We started with the original integral I, substituted t = arcsin x, leading to an integral in terms of t. Then integrated by parts, leading to I = 2(A - B), where A is this series involving β(3) and B is (π/2) ln 2. But if the original integral can be expressed in terms of known constants, then perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the original integral can be related to known integrals or use a different substitution.

Let me think again about the original integral:

∫₀¹ (1/x²) ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/x] (arcsin x)^2 dx.

Another approach: Let me consider expanding (arcsin x)^2 into a power series. The power series for arcsin x is known:

arcsin x = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) x^{2n + 1} }, for |x| ≤ 1.

Then (arcsin x)^2 would be the square of this series, which can be expressed as a Cauchy product. However, multiplying this by 1/x² and the logarithm term might lead to a complicated expression, but perhaps integrating term by term.

Alternatively, maybe use the substitution x = sin t again and express everything in terms of t, then expand in a Fourier series or use orthogonality.

Alternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me see if introducing a parameter helps. For example, consider a parameter a in the integrand and differentiate with respect to a to simplify.

Alternatively, think of the integral as a triple integral and change the order of integration. But this might be too vague.

Wait, another idea: the integrand has (arcsin x)^2, which can be expressed as an integral. Specifically, (arcsin x)^2 = ∫₀^x ∫₀^s [2 / sqrt(1 - t²)] dt ds. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, recall that (arcsin x)^2 can be expressed as an integral involving t^2 and substitution. Wait, perhaps integrating by parts multiple times.

Alternatively, let me check if the integral can be expressed in terms of known constants. For example, if the result is π^3/48 - (ln 2)π/2, or something similar. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, let me compute the numerical value of the integral to get an idea. Let's approximate the integral numerically.

But since the user also asks for a numerical approximation, maybe compute it numerically first to check.

But since I'm supposed to provide an exact analytical solution first, perhaps proceed with the current approach.

We have I = 2(A - B), where A = -2 β(3) and B = (π/2) ln 2. So I = 2(-2 β(3) - π/2 ln 2) = -4 β(3) - π ln 2. But this would mean the integral is negative, but the integrand is positive in (0,1). Wait, this can't be. There must be a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's check the steps again. When we did integration by parts for the original integral I, we had:

I = ∫₀^{π/2} t² [cos t / sin² t] ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

We set u = t², dv = [cos t / sin² t] ln(cot(t/2)) dt.

Then du = 2t dt, and v was computed as:

v = - [ln(cot(t/2)) / sin t] + cot t.

Then, I = u*v |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v * du.

But u*v at π/2 is (π/2)^2 * [ - ln(cot(π/4))/sin(π/2) + cot(π/2) ].

But cot(π/4) = 1, so ln(1) = 0. cot(π/2) = 0. So u*v at π/2 is (π²/4) * (0 + 0) = 0.

At t=0, u=0, so u*v is 0 * [something], which is 0. So the boundary terms are 0.

Then, I = - ∫₀^{π/2} v * du = - ∫₀^{π/2} [ - ln(cot(t/2))/sin t + cot t ] * 2t dt.

Which is equal to 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ ln(cot(t/2))/sin t - cot t ] t dt.

So I = 2(A - B), where A = ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2))/sin t dt, and B = ∫₀^{π/2} t cot t dt.

Then, we computed B = (π/2) ln 2.

For A, after substitution, we found that A = -2 β(3), where β(3) is the Dirichlet beta function at 3. But β(3) is a positive series: Σ (-1)^n / (2n+1)^3 ), which converges to approximately 0.968946...

But if A = -2 β(3), then I = 2(-2 β(3) - (π/2) ln 2) = -4 β(3) - π ln 2. But this would make the integral negative, which contradicts the fact that the integrand is positive in (0,1). Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during the calculation.

Let me check the computation of A. When we computed A = ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2))/sin t dt, after substitution, we ended up with A = -2 β(3). But β(3) is positive, so A would be negative, which might not make sense since the integrand of A is t ln(cot(t/2))/sin t. Let's check the integrand's sign.

For t in (0, π/2), cot(t/2) = [cos(t/2)/sin(t/2)] which is positive. So ln(cot(t/2)) is real. For t in (0, π/2), t/2 is in (0, π/4), so cot(t/2) > 1, so ln(cot(t/2)) > 0. Also, sin t is positive. Therefore, the integrand of A is positive, so A should be positive. But according to our previous result, A = -2 β(3), which is negative. So there's a sign error.

Let me trace back the computation of A. When we did the substitution for A, we set u = t/2, leading to:

A = ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(cot(t/2))/sin t dt.

Then substitution t = 2u, leading to:

A = 4 ∫₀^{π/4} u / sin(2u) * ln(cot u) du.

Then, after another substitution w = cot u, we ended up with:

A = 2 ∫₁^{∞} (arccot w * ln w) / w dw.

Then substitution z = 1/w, leading to:

A = 2 ∫₀¹ (arctan z * (-ln z)) / z dz.

= -2 ∫₀¹ (arctan z * ln z)/z dz.

Then expanding arctan z as a power series:

= -2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀¹ z^{2n} ln z dz.

But ∫₀¹ z^{2n} ln z dz = -1/(2n + 1)^2.

So:

A = -2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * (-1)/(2n + 1)^2) = 2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n + 1)^3.

Ah! Here's the mistake. Previously, I said A = -2 β(3), but actually, the series is Σ (-1)^n/(2n+1)^3, which is β(3). So A = 2 β(3).

But β(3) is positive series, since the terms alternate and the first term is positive. So β(3) = 1 - 1/3^3 + 1/5^3 - 1/7^3 + ... ≈ 0.968946...

Therefore, A = 2 β(3).

Then, I = 2(A - B) = 2(2 β(3) - (π/2) ln 2) = 4 β(3) - π ln 2.

This makes sense because the integral I is positive, and both terms are positive (since β(3) > 0 and π ln 2 > 0). But we need to check if 4 β(3) > π ln 2. Let's compute approximate values:

β(3) ≈ 0.968946...

4 β(3) ≈ 3.875784...

π ln 2 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.6931 ≈ 2.177...

So 4 β(3) - π ln 2 ≈ 3.875784 - 2.177 ≈ 1.69878...

But the actual value of the integral should be computed numerically to check.

But according to the problem statement, we need to find the exact analytical result. So if the integral I = 4 β(3) - π ln 2, then that's the exact answer. However, β(3) is a known constant, but it's not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, there might be a relation here that I'm missing.

Wait, but according to some mathematical references, the Dirichlet beta function at odd integers can sometimes be expressed in terms of π. For example, β(1) = π/4, β(3) = π³/32. Wait, let me check:

Wait, β(1) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) = π/4.

β(3) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1)^3. This is known as a special value. According to some sources, β(3) = π³/32. Let me verify this.

Let me compute π³/32 ≈ (31.00627668)/32 ≈ 0.968943... which matches the approximate value of β(3) ≈ 0.968946. So it's very close. Therefore, β(3) = π³/32.

Therefore, A = 2 β(3) = 2 * π³/32 = π³/16.

Then, I = 4 β(3) - π ln 2 = 4*(π³/32) - π ln 2 = π³/8 - π ln 2.

So the exact value of the integral is π³/8 - π ln 2.

Let me check this with the approximate calculation. π³/8 ≈ (31.00627668)/8 ≈ 3.875784585. π ln 2 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 0.6931471806 ≈ 2.1775860903. So π³/8 - π ln 2 ≈ 3.875784585 - 2.1775860903 ≈ 1.6981984947.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation of the original integral to see if it matches.

But since I can't compute it here, but based on the steps, if the analytical result is π³/8 - π ln 2, then the numerical approximation would be approximately 1.6981984947, which rounds to 1.6981984947.

But let me check with a calculator:

π³ ≈ 31.00627668

π³/8 ≈ 3.875784585

π ln 2 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 0.6931471806 ≈ 2.1775860903

Subtracting: 3.875784585 - 2.1775860903 = 1.6981984947.

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.6981984947 ≈ 1.6981984947.

So the exact answer is π³/8 - π ln 2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.6981984947.

Therefore, the final answer is:
