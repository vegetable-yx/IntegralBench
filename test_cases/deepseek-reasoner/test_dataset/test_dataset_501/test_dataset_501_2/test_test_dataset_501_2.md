Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of sin²(log x) from 0 to 1. Hmm, first, I should recall some integration techniques. Since the integrand is sin squared of a logarithm, maybe substitution would help. Let me think.

Log x is inside the sine squared. The limits are from 0 to 1, but log x approaches negative infinity as x approaches 0. Wait, but x=0 is a limit here. Maybe substitution t = log x? Let's try that.

Let t = log x. Then, when x = 1, t = 0. When x approaches 0, t approaches -infinity. So the integral becomes the integral from -infty to 0 of sin²(t) * e^t dt, because dx = e^t dt. Wait, no. Let me check: if x = e^t, then dx = e^t dt. So when x is from 0 to 1, t is from -infty to 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 sin²(t) * e^t dt. Hmm, that seems manageable.

But integrating sin²(t) times e^t. Maybe integration by parts? Or use a trigonometric identity to simplify sin²(t). Let's recall that sin²(t) = (1 - cos(2t))/2. So substituting that in, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{-infty}^0 (1 - cos(2t)) e^t dt. That splits into two integrals: (1/2)[∫_{-infty}^0 e^t dt - ∫_{-infty}^0 cos(2t) e^t dt].

First integral: ∫ e^t dt from -infty to 0. The antiderivative is e^t, evaluated from -infty to 0. e^0 - lim_{a->-infty} e^a = 1 - 0 = 1.

Second integral: ∫ cos(2t) e^t dt from -infty to 0. This seems trickier. Maybe integration by parts or use a formula for integrating e^{at} cos(bt) dt. The standard integral ∫ e^{at} cos(bt) dt = e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt)) / (a² + b²) + C. Let me confirm that. Let me set a = 1 and b = 2. So the integral becomes e^t (1*cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)) / (1 + 4) evaluated from -infty to 0. So (e^t (cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)))/5.

Evaluating from t = -infty to 0. At t=0: e^0 (cos0 + 2 sin0)/5 = (1*(1 + 0))/5 = 1/5. At t approaching -infty: e^t goes to 0, and cos(2t) and sin(2t) are bounded, so the whole term goes to 0. Therefore, the second integral is (1/5 - 0) = 1/5.

Putting it all together: (1/2)[1 - 1/5] = (1/2)(4/5) = 2/5. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.

Wait, the integral of cos(2t) e^t from -infty to 0 is 1/5. So the second integral is 1/5, so the whole expression is (1/2)(1 - 1/5) = (1/2)(4/5) = 2/5. So the exact answer is 2/5. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, but the original substitution was t = log x, so x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. The integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 sin²(t) e^t dt. Then using sin² identity, split into (1 - cos(2t))/2. Then split the integral. The first integral is (1/2) ∫ e^t dt from -infty to 0, which is (1/2)(1). The second integral is -(1/2) ∫ cos(2t) e^t dt from -infty to 0. Then using the integral formula, that's -(1/2)*(1/5) = -1/10. So total is 1/2 - 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5. Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, let me check the integral formula again. The integral ∫ e^{at} cos(bt) dt = e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt))/(a² + b²). So here, a is 1, b is 2. So the integral is e^t (cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t))/(1 + 4) = e^t (cos2t + 2 sin2t)/5. Evaluated from -infty to 0. At 0, it's (1*(1 + 0))/5 = 1/5. At -infty, e^t approaches 0, so the term is 0. So the integral is 1/5. Therefore, the second integral is -(1/2)*(1/5) = -1/10. Then total integral is 1/2 - 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5. So exact answer is 2/5. Numerically, 2/5 is 0.4. Let me check with a calculator. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So the numerical approximation is 0.4. But the problem says to round to 10 decimal places. So 0.4000000000.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, maybe use substitution in the original integral. Let me try integrating by parts. Let me set u = sin²(log x), dv = dx. Then du = 2 sin(log x) cos(log x) * (1/x) dx, and v = x. So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du. So x sin²(log x) evaluated from 0 to 1 minus ∫ x * 2 sin(log x) cos(log x) * (1/x) dx. The first term: at x=1, sin²(0) = 0, so 1*0 = 0. At x approaching 0, x sin²(log x). Let me see, as x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, sin²(log x) oscillates between 0 and 1. But multiplied by x approaching 0. So the limit is 0. So the first term is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the integral becomes - ∫ 2 sin(log x) cos(log x) dx. But 2 sin cos is sin(2 log x). So the integral is - ∫ sin(2 log x) dx. Now, we need to compute ∫ sin(2 log x) dx from 0 to1. Let me make substitution t = log x again. Then x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. So integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 sin(2t) e^t dt. Again, use integration by parts or the formula. Let me use the formula for ∫ e^{at} sin(bt) dt. The formula is e^{at} (a sin(bt) - b cos(bt))/(a² + b²). Here, a=1, b=2. So integral is e^t (sin(2t) - 2 cos(2t))/(1 +4) evaluated from -infty to 0. At t=0: e^0 (0 - 2*1)/5 = (-2)/5. At t approaching -infty: e^t approaches 0, so the term is 0. So the integral is (-2/5 - 0) = -2/5. Therefore, the original integral after integration by parts is - (-2/5) = 2/5. So same result. So the integral is indeed 2/5. So exact answer is 2/5, numerical is 0.4. So the answer is 2/5, which is 0.4 exactly. So the numerical approximation is 0.4000000000. So the JSON should be {"answer": "\\dfrac{2}{5}", "numerical_answer": 0.4000000000}. But wait, maybe check with another approach. Let me compute the integral from 0 to1 of sin²(log x) dx. Let me use substitution y = -log x. Then when x=0, y approaches infinity, x=1, y=0. Then x = e^{-y}, dx = -e^{-y} dy. The integral becomes ∫_{infty}^0 sin²(-y) (-e^{-y}) dy = ∫_0^infty sin²(y) e^{-y} dy. Since sin²(y) = (1 - cos(2y))/2, so integral becomes (1/2) ∫_0^infty (1 - cos(2y)) e^{-y} dy. Split into two integrals: (1/2)[∫_0^infty e^{-y} dy - ∫_0^infty cos(2y) e^{-y} dy]. First integral is (1/2)(1) since ∫ e^{-y} dy from 0 to infty is 1. Second integral: ∫_0^infty cos(2y) e^{-y} dy. Using the formula for Laplace transform: ∫_0^infty e^{-at} cos(bt) dt = a/(a² + b²). Here, a=1, b=2. So integral is 1/(1 +4) =1/5. So the second integral is 1/5. Therefore, the total integral is (1/2)(1 - 1/5) = (1/2)(4/5) = 2/5. Same result. So definitely, the exact answer is 2/5. So the numerical is 0.4. So the answer is correct.
