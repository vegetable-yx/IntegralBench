Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/3 of 1/(1 + tan²x) dx. Hmm, first, I remember that 1 + tan²x is equal to sec²x. So, the integrand simplifies to 1/sec²x, which is cos²x. So the integral becomes the integral of cos²x dx from 0 to π/3.

Now, integrating cos²x. I recall that there's a power-reduction formula for cosine squared. The formula is cos²x = (1 + cos2x)/2. So substituting that in, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1 + cos2x)/2 dx. That should be easier to integrate.

Let me split the integral into two parts: (1/2) times the integral of 1 dx plus (1/2) times the integral of cos2x dx. The integral of 1 dx is just x, and the integral of cos2x dx is (1/2) sin2x. So putting it all together, the antiderivative is (1/2)x + (1/4) sin2x, evaluated from 0 to π/3.

Now, plugging in the limits. First, at the upper limit π/3: (1/2)(π/3) + (1/4) sin(2*(π/3)). Let's compute each part. (1/2)(π/3) is π/6. Then, 2*(π/3) is 2π/3, and sin(2π/3) is √3/2. So (1/4)*(√3/2) is √3/8. So the upper part is π/6 + √3/8.

Now the lower limit 0: (1/2)(0 + (1/4) sin0). Both terms are 0, so the lower limit contributes nothing. Therefore, the definite integral is π/6 + √3/8.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, the antiderivative is (1/2)x + (1/4) sin2x. So when we plug in π/3, it's (2π/3) for the sin term? Wait, no, 2x when x is π/3 is 2π/3. So sin(2π/3) is indeed √3/2. So yes, (1/4)*(√3/2) is √3/8. So the total is π/6 + √3/8. Then subtract the lower limit, which is 0. So the exact answer is π/6 + √3/8.

Wait, but let me verify the integration steps again. The integral of cos²x dx is (x/2 + sin2x/4) + C. So when evaluated from 0 to π/3, that's [π/6 + (sin(2π/3))/4] - [0 + 0] = π/6 + (√3/2)/4 = π/6 + √3/8. That seems right.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute π/6 and √3/8. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π/6 ≈ 0.5235987756. √3 is approximately 1.73205080757, so √3/8 ≈ 0.2165063509. Adding them together: 0.5235987756 + 0.2165063509 ≈ 0.7401051265. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7401051265. Let me check the addition again. 0.5235987756 + 0.2165063509. Let's add the decimals:

0.5235987756
+0.2165063509
=0.7401051265. Yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is π/6 + √3/8, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7401051265.
