Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/3 of 1 over (1 + tan²x) dx. Hmm, first, I remember that 1 + tan²x is equal to sec²x. So maybe I can simplify the integrand using that identity. Let me check: yes, 1 + tan²x = sec²x. So the integrand becomes 1/sec²x, which is the same as cos²x. So the integral simplifies to the integral of cos²x dx from 0 to π/3.

Now, integrating cos²x. I recall that there's a power-reduction formula for cosine squared. The formula is cos²x = (1 + cos2x)/2. So substituting that in, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to π/3 of (1 + cos2x)/2 dx. Let me write that out: (1/2)∫(1 + cos2x) dx from 0 to π/3.

Breaking that into two separate terms, it's (1/2)[∫1 dx + ∫cos2x dx] evaluated from 0 to π/3. The integral of 1 dx is just x. For the integral of cos2x dx, I need to use substitution. Let me set u = 2x, so du = 2 dx, which means dx = du/2. So ∫cos2x dx becomes (1/2)∫cosu du = (1/2)sinu + C = (1/2)sin2x + C.

Putting it all together, the integral becomes (1/2)[x + (1/2)sin2x] evaluated from 0 to π/3. Let's compute the antiderivative at the upper limit π/3 first. Plugging in x = π/3: (1/2)[π/3 + (1/2)sin(2*(π/3))]. 2*(π/3) is 2π/3, and sin(2π/3) is √3/2. So that part becomes (1/2)[π/3 + (1/2)*(√3/2)] = (1/2)[π/3 + √3/4] = (π/6) + (√3)/8.

Now the lower limit at 0: (1/2)[0 + (1/2)sin0] = (1/2)(0 + 0) = 0. Subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit gives (π/6 + √3/8) - 0 = π/6 + √3/8. So the exact value of the integral is π/6 + √3/8.

Now, to find the numerical approximation. Let's compute each part. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π/6 is about 0.5235987756. √3 is approximately 1.7320508075, so √3/8 is about 0.2165063509. Adding them together: 0.5235987756 + 0.2165063509 = 0.7401051265. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7401051265. Let me double-check the calculations. π/6 ≈ 0.5235987756, √3/8 ≈ 0.2165063509. Sum is indeed approximately 0.7401051265. Seems correct.
