Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of (log x)/x² from 1 to infinity. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving logarithms often require integration by parts. Let me recall the formula for integration by parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Right, so I should choose u and dv such that when I differentiate u and integrate dv, the resulting integral is simpler.

Let me set u = log x. Then du would be (1/x) dx. That leaves dv as 1/x² dx. To find v, I need to integrate dv. The integral of 1/x² is -1/x, so v = -1/x. 

Applying integration by parts: ∫(log x)/x² dx = uv - ∫v du. Plugging in the values, that's (-log x)/x - ∫(-1/x)(1/x) dx. Simplify the integral part: the negative signs cancel, so it becomes (-log x)/x + ∫1/x² dx. 

Now, the remaining integral ∫1/x² dx is straightforward. The integral of 1/x² is -1/x + C. So putting it all together, the indefinite integral is (-log x)/x - 1/x + C. 

Wait, let me check that again. The integration by parts gives (-log x)/x + ∫1/x² dx. Then ∫1/x² dx is -1/x, so adding that gives (-log x)/x - 1/x. Yep, that's right. 

Now, the definite integral from 1 to infinity. So we need to evaluate the limit as b approaches infinity of [ (-log b)/b - 1/b ] minus [ (-log 1)/1 - 1/1 ]. 

Let's compute each part. First, as b approaches infinity, what happens to (-log b)/b? The logarithm grows slower than any linear function, so log b grows, but divided by b, which goes to infinity. The numerator grows to infinity, but the denominator grows faster. So by L’Hospital’s Rule, if we take the limit of log b / b as b→infty, that's equivalent to (1/b)/1 = 0. So (-log b)/b approaches 0. Similarly, -1/b also approaches 0. So the first part [ (-log b)/b - 1/b ] becomes 0 - 0 = 0.

Now the second part: at x=1, we have (-log 1)/1 - 1/1. Log 1 is 0, so that's 0 - 1 = -1. Therefore, the entire definite integral is 0 - (-1) = 1. 

So the exact value is 1. Let me verify this with a numerical approximation. If I compute the integral numerically, say from 1 to a large number like 1000, the integral should approach 1. Let's approximate it. The integral from 1 to N of (log x)/x² dx. Let's take N=1000. Using numerical integration methods like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, but maybe a quick estimation. Alternatively, since we know the exact answer is 1, but let's check with substitution. Alternatively, maybe use a calculator. But since the exact answer is 1, the numerical approximation should be approximately 1.0000000000. But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, when I did the integration by parts, I had:

∫(log x)/x² dx = (-log x)/x - ∫(-1/x)(1/x) dx = (-log x)/x + ∫1/x² dx. Then ∫1/x² dx is -1/x, so total is (-log x)/x -1/x. Then evaluated from 1 to infinity. At infinity, the terms (-log x)/x and -1/x both go to 0. At x=1, it's (-log 1)/1 -1/1 = 0 -1 = -1. So the integral is [0] - (-1) = 1. So the exact answer is 1. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. But wait, maybe I should check with a calculator. Let me compute the integral numerically. Let's approximate ∫₁^∞ (ln x)/x² dx. Let's compute it as a limit from 1 to N, then take N large. Let's take N=1000. The integral from 1 to 1000 of (ln x)/x² dx. Let's approximate this using substitution. Let me compute the exact value first. Wait, the exact value is 1, so the numerical approximation should be very close to 1. Let me check with N=1000. The value at upper limit N is (-ln N)/N -1/N. For N=1000, ln(1000) is about 6.907755. So (-6.907755)/1000 ≈ -0.006907755, and -1/1000 = -0.001. So total upper part is -0.007907755. Then subtract the lower limit at 1: (-0 -1) = -1. So the integral is (-0.007907755) - (-1) = 0.992092245. Wait, that's with N=1000. But as N approaches infinity, the upper part approaches 0, so the integral approaches 1. So with N=1000, the approximation is about 0.992092245. If I take N=1,000,000, then ln(1,000,000)=13.8155, so (-13.8155)/1,000,000 ≈ -0.0000138155, and -1/1,000,000 ≈ -0.000001. So upper part is -0.0000148155. Then subtract (-1), so integral is -0.0000148155 - (-1) = 0.9999851845. So with N=1e6, it's approximately 0.999985, which is getting closer to 1. So as N increases, the approximation approaches 1. Therefore, the exact value is indeed 1, and the numerical approximation would be 1.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places. So the answer is 1.
