Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of (log x)/x² from 1 to infinity. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving logarithms often require integration by parts. Let me recall the formula for integration by parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Right, so I should choose u and dv such that when I differentiate u and integrate dv, the resulting integral is simpler.

Let me set u = log x. Then du would be (1/x) dx. That leaves dv as 1/x² dx. To find v, I need to integrate dv. The integral of 1/x² is -1/x, so v = -1/x. 

Applying integration by parts: ∫(log x)/x² dx = uv - ∫v du. Plugging in the values, that's (log x)(-1/x) - ∫(-1/x)(1/x) dx. Simplify that: - (log x)/x + ∫1/x² dx. 

Now, the remaining integral is ∫1/x² dx, which we know is -1/x + C. So putting it all together, the indefinite integral becomes - (log x)/x - 1/x + C. 

Now, let's evaluate this from 1 to infinity. So the definite integral is [ - (log x)/x - 1/x ] from 1 to ∞. 

First, let's take the limit as x approaches infinity. For the term (log x)/x, as x becomes very large, log x grows much slower than x, so (log x)/x approaches 0. Similarly, 1/x also approaches 0. Therefore, the upper limit evaluates to 0 - 0 = 0.

Now, evaluate at the lower limit x=1: - (log 1)/1 - 1/1. Since log 1 is 0, this simplifies to -0 -1 = -1.

Subtracting the lower limit result from the upper limit: 0 - (-1) = 1. So the exact value of the integral is 1.

To get the numerical approximation, since the exact answer is 1, the numerical value is 1.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any mistake here. Let me verify the steps again.

Integration by parts: u = log x, du = 1/x dx. dv = 1/x² dx, v = -1/x. Then uv is -log x /x. Then -∫v du is -∫(-1/x)(1/x) dx = ∫1/x² dx = -1/x. So the antiderivative is -log x /x -1/x. Evaluated from 1 to ∞. At infinity, both terms go to 0. At 1, log 1 is 0, so it's -0 -1 = -1. So 0 - (-1) = 1. Yep, that's correct. So the exact answer is 1, and numerically it's 1.0000000000. That seems right. I don't see any errors here.
