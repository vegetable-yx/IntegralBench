Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is from 0 to 2.0 of x^(-1/2)(2.0 - x)^(-1/2) times arcsin(0.5√(x(2.0 - x))) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it.

First, let me rewrite the integral for clarity. The integrand is x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 - x)) ). The limits are from 0 to 2. The presence of x and (2 - x) suggests a substitution that can symmetrize the expression. Maybe a trigonometric substitution? Let's consider substituting x in terms of sin or cos. Alternatively, since the argument inside the arcsin is (1/2)√(x(2 - x)), perhaps we can set that equal to sinθ or something similar.

Wait, let's look at the term inside the arcsin: (1/2)√(x(2 - x)). Let me denote that as sinθ. So, set sinθ = (1/2)√(x(2 - x)). But maybe a better approach is to let t = √(x(2 - x))/2. Then, arcsin(t) is part of the integrand. Let's see if we can express x in terms of t.

Alternatively, let's try a substitution for the entire integral. Let me consider substituting x = 2 sin²θ. Then, when x = 0, θ = 0, and when x = 2, θ = π/2. Let's because if x = 2 sin²θ, then when θ = π/2, sinθ = 1, so x = 2*1 = 2. Let's check dx: dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then, 2 - x = 2 - 2 sin²θ = 2 cos²θ. So, √(2 - x) would be √(2 cos²θ) = √2 cosθ. Similarly, x^{-1/2} is (2 sin²θ)^{-1/2} = (1/√2) (sinθ)^{-1}. Similarly, (2 - x)^{-1/2} is (2 cos²θ)^{-1/2} = (1/√2) (cosθ)^{-1}. So putting those together, x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} becomes (1/√2)(sinθ)^{-1} * (1/√2)(cosθ)^{-1} = (1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^{-1}.

Now, the integrand becomes (1/(2 sinθ cosθ)) * arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 - x)) ) * dx. Let's compute the argument of arcsin. Since x = 2 sin²θ, then x(2 - x) = 2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ. So √(x(2 - x)) = √(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Then, (1/2) times that is (1/2)(2 sinθ cosθ) = sinθ cosθ. Therefore, arcsin(sinθ cosθ). Hmm, that's the argument inside the arcsin. So the integrand becomes (1/(2 sinθ cosθ)) * arcsin(sinθ cosθ) * dx. But dx is 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. So substituting all together:

Integral becomes (1/(2 sinθ cosθ)) * arcsin(sinθ cosθ) * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. The sinθ cosθ in the denominator cancels with the 4 sinθ cosθ in the numerator, leaving 4/2 = 2. So the integral simplifies to 2 ∫ arcsin(sinθ cosθ) dθ from θ=0 to θ=π/2.

So now, the integral is 2 times the integral from 0 to π/2 of arcsin(sinθ cosθ) dθ. Hmm, that seems simpler. Now, how to compute ∫ arcsin(sinθ cosθ) dθ. Let's denote φ = θ. Maybe another substitution here. Let me think about the expression sinθ cosθ. That's equal to (1/2) sin(2θ). Wait, sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin(2θ). So arcsin( (1/2) sin(2θ) ). So the integrand becomes arcsin( (1/2) sin(2θ) ). Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set u = 2θ. Then, when θ=0, u=0; θ=π/2, u=π. Then, dθ = du/2. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=π of arcsin( (1/2) sinu ) * (du/2). Therefore, the original integral is 2 * (1/2) ∫ from 0 to π of arcsin( (1/2) sinu ) du = ∫ from 0 to π of arcsin( (1/2) sinu ) du. Wait, but that seems a bit more complicated. Maybe there's a symmetry here.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating from 0 to π/2, and then using symmetry. Let me check the integrand arcsin( (1/2) sin(2θ) ). Let’s consider substitution t = π/2 - θ. Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let’s try integrating by parts. Let’s set u = arcsin( (1/2) sin(2θ) ), dv = dθ. Then, du = [1 / sqrt(1 - ( (1/2 sin2θ)^2 )) ] * (1/2) * 2 cos2θ dθ = [1 / sqrt(1 - (1/4 sin²2θ)) ] * cos2θ dθ. And v = θ. Wait, but integrating by parts would lead to uv - ∫ v du. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, consider expanding arcsin in a power series. The Taylor series expansion of arcsin(z) is z + (1/6) z^3 + (3/40) z^5 + ... for |z| ≤ 1. Here, z = (1/2) sin2θ. Since sin2θ ranges from 0 to 1 (since θ is from 0 to π/2, so 2θ from 0 to π, so sin2θ from 0 to 1 and back to 0). So z ranges from 0 to 1/2. So the series would converge. Let's try that.

So arcsin(z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) z^{2n + 1} }, for |z| ≤ 1. So substituting z = (1/2) sin2θ, we have arcsin( (1/2) sin2θ ) = sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) ] * ( (1/2) sin2θ )^{2n + 1} }.

Then, integrating term by term from 0 to π/2. So the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} } ] * ∫_{0}^{π/2} (sin2θ)^{2n + 1} dθ.

But integrating (sin2θ)^{2n + 1} over 0 to π/2. Let’s make substitution phi = 2θ, so dphi = 2 dθ, limits from 0 to π. Then, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{0}^{π} (sin phi)^{2n + 1} dphi. But the integral of (sin phi)^{2n + 1} from 0 to π is 2 * ∫_{0}^{π/2} (sin phi)^{2n + 1} dphi. So the original integral over theta becomes (1/2) * 2 * ∫_{0}^{π/2} (sin phi)^{2n + 1} dphi = ∫_{0}^{π/2} (sin phi)^{2n + 1} dphi.

The integral ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin^{2n + 1}phi dphi is given by the beta function: (sqrt(π)/2) * Γ(n + 1) / Γ(n + 3/2). Alternatively, using the formula for even and odd powers: for integer k, ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k + 1}phi dphi = (2k k!) / ( (2k + 1)!! ) * π/2. Wait, but maybe better to recall that ∫0^{π/2} sin^{m}phi dphi = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((m + 1)/2) / Γ((m + 2)/2). For m = 2n + 1, this becomes (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(n + 3/2). And Γ(n + 1) = n!, and Γ(n + 3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n + 1}) ) (2n + 2)! ) / (n + 1)! ). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that Γ(n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / 4^n n! ). So Γ(n + 3/2) = Γ(n + 1 + 1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n + 2)! ) / 4^{n + 1} (n + 1)! )? Wait, perhaps not. Let me check for n=0: Γ(3/2) = (1/2) sqrt(π). For n=1: Γ(5/2) = (3/2)(1/2)sqrt(π) = 3 sqrt(π)/4. So in general, Γ(n + 3/2) = (2n + 1)!! / 2^{n + 1} ) sqrt(π). Hmm, maybe it's better to use the relation Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z). So Γ(n + 3/2) = (n + 1/2) Γ(n + 1/2). And Γ(n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / 4^n n! ). Therefore, Γ(n + 3/2) = (n + 1/2) * sqrt(π) (2n)! / (4^n n! ) = sqrt(π) (2n + 1)! ) / (4^{n + 1/2} n! ) )? Maybe not. Let me compute Γ(n + 3/2):

Γ(n + 3/2) = (n + 1/2) Γ(n + 1/2) = (n + 1/2)(n - 1/2) Γ(n - 1/2) = ... down to Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π). So Γ(n + 3/2) = sqrt(π) (4^n n! ) / (2n + 1)! ) )? Wait, perhaps I need to look up the exact expression. Alternatively, use the duplication formula. Alternatively, perhaps use the beta function relation. The integral ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2n + 1}phi dphi = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(n + 3/2). So substituting back into the series:

The integral over theta becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} ] * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n + 1) / Γ(n + 3/2) )

Simplify this expression. Let's note that Γ(n + 1) = n! and Γ(n + 3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n + 1}) ) (2n + 2)! ) / (n + 1)! )? Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall that Γ(n + 3/2) = (2n + 1)!! / 2^{n + 1} ) sqrt(π). The double factorial (2n + 1)!! = (2n + 1)(2n - 1)...5*3*1. Also, (2n + 1)!! = (2n + 1)! ) / (2^n n! ). So Γ(n + 3/2) = ( (2n + 1)! ) / (2^n n! ) ) * sqrt(π) / 2^{n + 1} ) = sqrt(π) (2n + 1)! ) / (2^{2n + 1} n! ). Therefore, Γ(n + 3/2) = sqrt(π) (2n + 1)! ) / (2^{2n + 1} n! ). Therefore, substituting back into the integral:

The integral over theta is sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} ] * (sqrt(π)/2) * n! / ( sqrt(π) (2n + 1)! / (2^{2n + 1} n! )) )

Simplify term by term:

First, the constants:

(2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} * (sqrt(π)/2) * n! / ( sqrt(π) (2n + 1)! / (2^{2n + 1} n! )) )

The sqrt(π) cancels out. Then:

(2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} * (1/2) * n! * 2^{2n + 1} n! / (2n + 1)! )

Simplify the exponents:

4^n is 2^{2n}, and 2^{2n + 1} / 2^{2n + 1} (from 1/2^{2n +1} and 2^{2n +1}) would be 1. Wait, let's compute:

(1/2)^{2n +1} * 2^{2n +1} = (2^{-(2n +1)}) * 2^{2n +1} ) = 1.

Similarly, 4^n = 2^{2n}, so 2^{2n} in the denominator. But let's see:

The term (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1)) ) * (1/2)^{2n + 1} * (1/2) * n! * 2^{2n +1} n! / (2n + 1)! )

Let me write all factors:

Numerator: (2n)! * n! * 2^{2n +1} * n! * 1/2

Denominator: 4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1) ) * (2^{2n +1}) ) * (2n + 1)! )

Wait, no. Let me re-express each part step by step.

Original term:

[ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1)) ) ] * [ (1/2)^{2n + 1} ] * [ (1/2) ] * [ n! * 2^{2n +1} n! / (2n + 1)! ) ]

Let's break it down:

First factor: (2n)! / [4^n (n! )^2 (2n + 1) ]

Second factor: (1/2)^{2n +1}

Third factor: 1/2

Fourth factor: [n! * 2^{2n +1} n! ] / (2n +1)! )

Multiply all these together:

Multiply the numerators: (2n)! * 1 * 1 * n! * n! * 2^{2n +1}

Multiply the denominators: 4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) * 2^{2n +1} * 2 * (2n +1)! )

Wait, no. Let me re-express each part:

First factor numerator: (2n)!

First factor denominator: 4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1)

Second factor numerator: 1

Second factor denominator: 2^{2n +1}

Third factor numerator: 1

Third factor denominator: 2

Fourth factor numerator: n! * n! * 2^{2n +1}

Fourth factor denominator: (2n +1)! )

So overall numerator: (2n)! * 1 * 1 * n! * n! * 2^{2n +1}

Overall denominator: 4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) * 2^{2n +1} * 2 * (2n +1)! )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2n)! * n!^2 * 2^{2n +1}

Denominator: 4^n * n!^2 * (2n +1) * 2^{2n +1} * 2 * (2n +1)! )

Cancel out common terms:

n!^2 cancels in numerator and denominator.

2^{2n +1} cancels in numerator and denominator.

So numerator: (2n)! 

Denominator: 4^n * (2n +1) * 2 * (2n +1)! )

But 4^n = 2^{2n}, so denominator: 2^{2n} * 2 * (2n +1) * (2n +1)! ) = 2^{2n +1} (2n +1) (2n +1)! )

So now, the term simplifies to (2n)! / [2^{2n +1} (2n +1) (2n +1)! ) ]

But (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)! ), so denominator becomes 2^{2n +1} (2n +1) (2n +1)(2n)! ) = 2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 (2n)! )

Therefore, the term simplifies to 1 / [2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ]

So putting it all together, each term in the sum is 1 / [2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ]

Therefore, the integral over theta is sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ]

But wait, the original integral was 2 times the integral from 0 to π/2 of arcsin(...) dθ, which we transformed into this sum. Wait, let's recap:

Original integral after substitution became 2 * ∫0^{π/2} arcsin( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Then, we expanded arcsin into a power series, substituted, and after simplifying, each term in the sum became 1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ). So the integral is sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ].

But wait, the integral after substitution was 2 * [sum_{n=0}^∞ term]. Wait, no. Let me check:

Wait, the original integral was transformed into 2 * ∫0^{π/2} arcsin(...) dθ. Then, we expanded that integral into a sum, and after substitution and simplification, each term in the sum became 1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ). Therefore, the entire integral is 2 * sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ].

But 2 * sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 ) ] = sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n} (2n +1)^2 ) ].

So the integral is equal to sum_{n=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2n} (2n +1)^2 ) ].

Hmm, this series looks familiar. Let's see if we can relate it to known series. The sum over n from 0 to infinity of 1/( (2n +1)^2 4^n ). Let me write 4^n as 2^{2n}, so 1/(2^{2n} (2n +1)^2 ). This is equivalent to sum_{k=1,3,5,...} 1/(k^2 (2^{k -1}) ). But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is related to the dilogarithm function, Li_2(z), which is sum_{k=1}^∞ z^k /k^2. So if we set z = 1/4, but only for odd k. Let me see:

sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/( (2n +1)^2 4^n ) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (1/4)^n / (2n +1)^2 = sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/4)^k} / (2k +1)^2.

This is similar to the series for the dilogarithm but only over odd terms. There is a formula for such sums. Recall that sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +1}/(2k +1)^2 = (1/2)(Li_2(z) - Li_2(-z)). If we set z = 1/2, then sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/2)^{2k +1}/(2k +1)^2 = (1/2)(Li_2(1/2) - Li_2(-1/2)). But our sum is sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/4)^k / (2k +1)^2. Let me make substitution m = k, so (1/4)^k = (1/2)^{2k}, so sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/2)^{2k}/(2k +1)^2. Let’s set t = 1/2, then sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k}/(2k +1)^2. Hmm, how to express this in terms of known functions.

Alternatively, consider that sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k}/(2k +1)^2 = (1/(2t)) ∫0^t [sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1) ] dx. Because integrating term by term, the integral of x^{2k} is x^{2k +1}/(2k +1), so sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1) = (1/x) sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +1}/(2k +1) ) = (1/x) * artanh(x) or similar. Wait, sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +1}/(2k +1) = arctanh(x) for |x| <1. So sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1) = (1/x) arctanh(x). Therefore, sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k}/(2k +1)^2 = (1/(2t)) ∫0^t (1/x) arctanh(x) dx.

But integrating (1/x) arctanh(x) dx. Let me compute that integral. Let’s set u = arctanh(x), dv = (1/x) dx. Then du = 1/(1 - x^2) dx, v = ln x. Wait, integration by parts: ∫ (1/x) arctanh(x) dx = arctanh(x) ln x - ∫ ln x * (1/(1 - x^2)) dx. Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let’s set t = x^2. Not sure. Alternatively, expand arctanh(x) as a series. arctanh(x) = sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +1}/(2k +1) for |x| <1. So (1/x) arctanh(x) = sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1). Then, integrating from 0 to t:

∫0^t sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1) dx = sum_{k=0}^∞ ∫0^t x^{2k}/(2k +1) dx = sum_{k=0}^∞ [x^{2k +1}/( (2k +1)(2k +1) ) ] from 0 to t = sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k +1}/( (2k +1)^2 ). Therefore, the integral is sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k +1}/( (2k +1)^2 ). But this is the same as the original sum we were trying to compute. So this approach might not help.

Alternatively, recall that the sum sum_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k}/(2k +1)^2 is related to the dilogarithm function. Specifically, it can be expressed in terms of Li_2(x) and Li_2(-x). Let me check known series expansions. For example, we know that:

sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +1}/(2k +1)^2 = (1/2)(Li_2(z) - Li_2(-z)).

But our sum is sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k}/(2k +1)^2. Let’s set z = t^2. Then sum_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k}/(2k +1)^2 = sum_{k=0}^∞ (t^2)^k/(2k +1)^2. Let’s set s = t^2. Then sum_{k=0}^∞ s^k/(2k +1)^2. This is the same as sum_{k=0}^∞ s^k/( (2k +1)^2 ). I think this is related to the Lerch transcendent function, but perhaps there's a closed-form expression for specific values of s.

Alternatively, consider using integral representations. For example, 1/(2k +1)^2 = ∫0^1 ∫0^1 (xy)^{2k} dx dy. Then, sum_{k=0}^∞ s^k/(2k +1)^2 = ∫0^1 ∫0^1 sum_{k=0}^∞ (s x^2 y^2 )^k dx dy = ∫0^1 ∫0^1 1/(1 - s x^2 y^2 ) dx dy. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, for s = 1/4, which is our case. So sum_{k=0}^∞ (1/4)^k/(2k +1)^2 = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(4^k (2k +1)^2 ). Let me check if this sum has a known closed-form. Searching my memory, I recall that sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/( (2k +1)^2 4^k ) is equal to π^2/16 - (ln(2))^2 /2. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, consider using the integral representation of the sum. Let’s write:

sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(4^k (2k +1)^2 ) = sum_{k=0}^∞ ∫0^1 ∫0^1 (xy)^{2k} dx dy /4^k = ∫0^1 ∫0^1 sum_{k=0}^∞ (x^2 y^2 /4 )^k dx dy = ∫0^1 ∫0^1 1/(1 - x^2 y^2 /4 ) dx dy.

But integrating 1/(1 - x^2 y^2 /4 ) over the unit square. This might be challenging, but perhaps we can make a change of variables. Let’s set u = xy/2. Then, but not sure. Alternatively, switch to polar coordinates. Let’s try substituting u = x, v = y, but not sure. Alternatively, fix x and integrate over y. So inner integral over y: ∫0^1 1/(1 - x^2 y^2 /4 ) dy. Let’s make substitution t = xy/2, so y = 2t/(x), dy = 2/(x). Then, when y=0, t=0; y=1, t=x/2. So the integral becomes ∫0^{x/2} 1/(1 - t^2 ) * 2/(x) dt = (2/x) ∫0^{x/2} 1/(1 - t^2 ) dt = (2/x) artanh(t) from 0 to x/2 = (2/x) artanh(x/2).

Therefore, the inner integral becomes (2/x) artanh(x/2). Then, the outer integral is ∫0^1 (2/x) artanh(x/2) dx. So the sum is ∫0^1 (2/x) artanh(x/2) dx.

Now, compute ∫0^1 (2/x) artanh(x/2) dx. Let’s make substitution z = x/2, so x = 2z, dx = 2 dz, limits from z=0 to z=1/2. Then, the integral becomes ∫0^{1/2} (2/(2z)) artanh(z) * 2 dz = ∫0^{1/2} (1/z) artanh(z) * 2 dz = 2 ∫0^{1/2} artanh(z)/z dz.

Now, integrate artanh(z)/z. Let’s recall that artanh(z) = (1/2) ln( (1 + z)/(1 - z) ). So artanh(z)/z = (1/(2z)) ln( (1 + z)/(1 - z) ). Let’s make substitution t = z^2. Not sure. Alternatively, expand artanh(z) as a series and integrate term by term. artanh(z) = sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +1}/(2k +1) for |z| <1. So artanh(z)/z = sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k}/(2k +1). Therefore, ∫0^{1/2} artanh(z)/z dz = ∫0^{1/2} sum_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k}/(2k +1) dz = sum_{k=0}^∞ ∫0^{1/2} z^{2k}/(2k +1) dz = sum_{k=0}^∞ [ z^{2k +1}/( (2k +1)(2k +1) ) ] from 0 to 1/2 = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (1/2)^{2k +1} ) / ( (2k +1)^2 ) = (1/2) sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(4^k (2k +1)^2 ). But this is exactly half of the original sum we are trying to compute. Let’s denote S = sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(4^k (2k +1)^2 ). Then, the integral becomes 2 * (1/2) S = S. Therefore, we have S = S. Which is a tautology. So this approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps use integration by parts. Let’s compute ∫ artanh(z)/z dz. Let’s set u = artanh(z), dv = dz/z. Then, du = 1/(1 - z^2) dz, v = ln z. So integration by parts gives:

uv - ∫ v du = artanh(z) ln z - ∫ ln z * (1/(1 - z^2)) dz.

But the remaining integral ∫ ln z / (1 - z^2) dz. This can be split into partial fractions: 1/(1 - z^2) = 1/2 [1/(1 - z) + 1/(1 + z) ]. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ ln z [1/(1 - z) + 1/(1 + z) ] dz.

But integrating these terms separately. Let’s consider ∫ ln z / (1 - z) dz and ∫ ln z / (1 + z) dz.

For the first integral, ∫ ln z / (1 - z) dz. Let’s make substitution t = 1 - z, so z = 1 - t, dz = -dt. The integral becomes ∫ ln(1 - t) / t (-dt) = ∫ ln(1 - t)/t dt from t=1 - z=0 to t=1 - z=1 - 0=1. Wait, but the original limits for z are from 0 to 1/2. So t would be from 1 to 1/2. So the integral becomes ∫_{t=1}^{t=1/2} ln(1 - t)/t (-dt) = ∫_{1/2}^1 ln(1 - t)/t dt. But this is the same as -∫_{1/2}^1 ln(1 - t)/t dt. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use series expansion for 1/(1 - z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ z^n for |z| <1. So ∫ ln z / (1 - z) dz = ∫ ln z sum_{n=0}^∞ z^n dz = sum_{n=0}^∞ ∫ z^n ln z dz. The integral of z^n ln z dz is z^{n +1}/(n +1)^2 ( (n +1) ln z -1 ). Evaluated from 0 to 1/2. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, recall that ∫ ln z / (1 - z) dz = - Li_2(z) + C. Similarly, ∫ ln z / (1 + z) dz = - Li_2(-z) + C. Therefore, the integral ∫ ln z / (1 - z^2) dz = (1/2)( - Li_2(z) - Li_2(-z) ) + C.

Therefore, going back to the integration by parts:

∫ artanh(z)/z dz = artanh(z) ln z - (1/2)( - Li_2(z) - Li_2(-z) ) ) + C.

Therefore, the definite integral from 0 to 1/2 is:

[ artanh(1/2) ln(1/2) - (1/2)( - Li_2(1/2) - Li_2(-1/2) ) ] - [ lim_{z→0} artanh(z) ln z - (1/2)( - Li_2(0) - Li_2(0) ) ]

As z approaches 0, artanh(z) ~ z, so artanh(z) ln z ~ z ln z → 0. Li_2(0) = 0. So the lower limit terms vanish. Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1/2 is:

artanh(1/2) ln(1/2) - (1/2)( - Li_2(1/2) - Li_2(-1/2) )

Simplify:

artanh(1/2) = (1/2) ln( (1 + 1/2)/(1 - 1/2) ) = (1/2) ln(3/1) = (1/2) ln3.

So artanh(1/2) ln(1/2) = (1/2 ln3)(-ln2).

The second term: - (1/2)( - Li_2(1/2) - Li_2(-1/2) ) = (1/2)( Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) ).

Therefore, the integral ∫0^{1/2} artanh(z)/z dz = ( - (1/2) ln3 ln2 ) + (1/2)( Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) ).

Recall that Li_2(1/2) = (π^2)/12 - (ln2)^2 /2, and Li_2(-1/2) = - (π^2)/12 + (ln2)^2 /2. Let me verify:

Li_2(1/2) is known to be π²/12 - (ln2)²/2. Li_2(-1/2) can be found using the identity Li_2(-z) + Li_2(z) = (1/2) Li_2(z²). For z=1/2, Li_2(-1/2) + Li_2(1/2) = (1/2) Li_2(1/4). But I think Li_2(-1/2) is also known to be -π²/12 + (ln2)^2/2. Let me check:

Using the identity Li_2(z) + Li_2(-z) = (1/2) Li_2(z²). For z=1/2, Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) = (1/2) Li_2(1/4). We know Li_2(1/4) can be expressed in terms of other constants, but perhaps it's necessary to use specific values. Alternatively, recall that Li_2(-1/2) = -π²/12 + (ln2)^2/2. Let's assume that's correct. Then:

Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) = [π²/12 - (ln2)^2/2] + [ -π²/12 + (ln2)^2/2 ] = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check actual values.

Li_2(1/2) is approximately 0.5822405265. Li_2(-1/2) is approximately -0.4484142069. Their sum is approximately 0.1338263196. Li_2(1/4) is approximately 0.2674011005. Then, (1/2) Li_2(1/4) ≈ 0.1337005503, which is close to the sum, so the identity holds approximately. Therefore, Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) ≈ (1/2) Li_2(1/4). But exact expressions are more complicated. However, for our purposes, we can use known values:

Li_2(1/2) = π²/12 - (ln2)²/2

Li_2(-1/2) = -π²/12 + (ln2)²/2 - (ln2)²/2 = ? Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me recall that Li_2(-1/2) can be expressed using the formula:

Li_2(-z) = - Li_2(z/(z -1)) - (1/2)(ln(1 - z))².

But this might not help. Alternatively, use the inversion formula:

Li_2(z) + Li_2(1 - z) = π²/6 - lnz ln(1 - z).

But not sure. Alternatively, use the value from literature. According to some sources, Li_2(-1/2) = -π²/12 + (ln2)^2/2. Let's assume that's correct. Then:

Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) = [π²/12 - (ln2)^2/2] + [ -π²/12 + (ln2)^2/2 ] = 0. But this contradicts the approximate values. Therefore, this must be incorrect. Therefore, my assumption about Li_2(-1/2) is wrong.

Let me look up exact expressions. According to some references, Li_2(1/2) = (π²/12) - (ln2)^2/2. For Li_2(-1/2), using the identity Li_2(-z) + Li_2(z) = (1/2) Li_2(z²) for |z| ≤1. Let’s set z=1/2. Then, Li_2(-1/2) + Li_2(1/2) = (1/2) Li_2(1/4). We know Li_2(1/4) can be expressed as:

Li_2(1/4) = π²/6 - 2 (ln2)^2 - 2 Li_2(-1/3). But this seems to get more complicated. Alternatively, using numerical approximations:

Li_2(1/2) ≈ 0.5822405265

Li_2(-1/2) ≈ -0.4484142069

Their sum ≈ 0.1338263196

Li_2(1/4) ≈ 0.2674011005, so (1/2) Li_2(1/4) ≈ 0.1337005503, which is close to the sum, confirming the identity. Therefore, Li_2(1/2) + Li_2(-1/2) = (1/2) Li_2(1/4). But we need an exact expression for Li_2(1/4). However, I don't think there's a simple closed-form for Li_2(1/4). Therefore, perhaps we need to accept that the sum S cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and is equal to the original integral, which is the same as the sum. But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. Therefore, perhaps there's a different approach to evaluate the original integral that leads to a closed-form expression.

Let me go back to the original integral:

∫0^2 x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ) dx.

We made the substitution x = 2 sin²θ, which transformed the integral into 2 ∫0^{π/2} arcsin( sinθ cosθ ) dθ. Then, we recognized that sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ, so the integral became 2 ∫0^{π/2} arcsin( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Then, we tried expanding in a series and ended up with a sum that we couldn't resolve.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can be made in the original integral. Let me consider another substitution. Let’s set t = √(x(2 -x))/2. Then, t = √(x(2 -x))/2. Let’s express x in terms of t. Let’s square both sides: t^2 = x(2 -x)/4 → 4t^2 = 2x -x^2 → x^2 -2x +4t^2 =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± √(4 -16t^2)]/2 = 1 ± √(1 -4t^2). But since x is between 0 and 2, both roots are valid. However, this substitution might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps set t = arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ). Then, the integrand becomes t * [x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2} dx]. But we need to express dx in terms of dt.

Let’s compute dt/dx:

t = arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) )

dt/dx = [1 / sqrt(1 - ( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) )^2 ) ] * (1/2) * [ (2 -x) -x ] / (2√(x(2 -x)) )

Simplify:

First, the derivative of the inside function:

d/dx [ (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ] = (1/2) * [ (2 -x) -x*(-1) ] / (2√(x(2 -x)) ) = (1/2) * (2 -x +x) / (2√(x(2 -x)) ) = (1/2) * 2 / (2√(x(2 -x)) ) = 1/(2√(x(2 -x)) )

Therefore, dt/dx = [1 / sqrt(1 - (x(2 -x)/4) ) ] * 1/(2√(x(2 -x)) )

But 1 - x(2 -x)/4 = 1 - (2x -x²)/4 = (4 -2x +x²)/4 = (x² -2x +4)/4. Not sure if this simplifies. Let’s compute:

x² -2x +4 = (x -1)^2 +3, which doesn't simplify nicely. Therefore, this substitution might not help.

Alternatively, let's consider another substitution. Let’s set y = x -1. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{-1}^{1} (y +1)^{-1/2} (1 - y)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√{(y +1)(1 - y)} ) dy. The term (y +1)(1 - y) = 1 - y². So the argument inside arcsin is (1/2)√(1 - y²). So the integrand becomes (y +1)^{-1/2} (1 - y)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(1 - y²) ) dy. But (y +1)^{-1/2} (1 - y)^{-1/2} = (1 - y²)^{-1/2}. So the integral becomes ∫_{-1}^{1} (1 - y²)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(1 - y²) ) dy. This looks like an integral over a symmetric interval. Since the integrand is even (since (1 - y²)^{-1/2} is even, and arcsin( (1/2)√(1 - y²) ) is even), we can write the integral as 2 ∫0^1 (1 - y²)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(1 - y²) ) dy.

Now, let’s make substitution z = y. Let’s set t = √(1 - y²). Then, y = sqrt(1 - t²), dy = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. When y=0, t=1; y=1, t=0. So the integral becomes 2 ∫1^0 (1 - (1 - t²))^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2) t ) * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Simplify:

1 - (1 - t²) = t², so (t²)^{-1/2} = 1/t. The integral becomes 2 ∫1^0 (1/t) arcsin(t/2) * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = 2 ∫0^1 (1/t) arcsin(t/2) * (t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = 2 ∫0^1 arcsin(t/2) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

So the integral simplifies to 2 ∫0^1 arcsin(t/2) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Let’s make substitution u = arcsin(t/2). Then, t = 2 sinu, dt = 2 cosu du. When t=0, u=0; t=1, u=arcsin(1/2)=π/6. The integral becomes 2 ∫0^{π/6} u / sqrt(1 - (2 sinu)^2 ) * 2 cosu du.

Simplify the denominator: sqrt(1 -4 sin²u). So the integral is 2 * 2 ∫0^{π/6} u cosu / sqrt(1 -4 sin²u) du = 4 ∫0^{π/6} u cosu / sqrt(1 -4 sin²u) du.

This seems more complicated. Perhaps another substitution. Let’s set v = sinu. Then, dv = cosu du. The integral becomes from v=0 to v=1/2. So:

4 ∫0^{1/2} arcsin(v) / sqrt(1 -4v²) dv. But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, consider expanding arcsin(t/2) in a power series. arcsin(t/2) = sum_{n=0}^∞ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ) (t/2)^{2n +1} }, as before. Then, the integral becomes 2 ∫0^1 sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ) (t^{2n +1}/2^{2n +1}) ] / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

Interchange sum and integral:

2 sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ) * 1/2^{2n +1} ] ∫0^1 t^{2n +1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

Let’s compute the integral ∫0^1 t^{2n +1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Make substitution s = t², so t = sqrt(s), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(s))) ds. Then, the integral becomes ∫0^1 s^{n +1/2} / sqrt(1 -s) * (1/(2 sqrt(s))) ds = (1/2) ∫0^1 s^{n} / sqrt(1 -s) ds.

This is (1/2) B(n +1, 1/2) = (1/2) Γ(n +1) Γ(1/2) / Γ(n + 3/2). Γ(n +1) = n!, Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), and Γ(n + 3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n +1}) (2n +2)! ) / (n +1)! ). Wait, as before, Γ(n + 3/2) = (2n +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{n +1}. And (2n +1)!! = (2n +1)! ) / (2^n n! ). Therefore, Γ(n + 3/2) = ( (2n +1)! ) / (2^n n! ) ) * sqrt(π)/2^{n +1} ) = sqrt(π) (2n +1)! ) / (2^{2n +1} n! ).

Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2) * n! * sqrt(π) / ( sqrt(π) (2n +1)! ) / (2^{2n +1} n! ) ) ) = (1/2) * n! * sqrt(π) * 2^{2n +1} n! / ( (2n +1)! sqrt(π) ) ) = (1/2) * 2^{2n +1} (n! )^2 / (2n +1)! ).

Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 t^{2n +1}/sqrt(1 - t²) dt = 2^{2n} (n! )^2 / (2n +1)! ).

Substituting back into the sum:

2 sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ) * 1/2^{2n +1} ] * 2^{2n} (n! )^2 / (2n +1)! )

Simplify term by term:

Numerator: 2 * (2n)! * 2^{2n} (n! )^2

Denominator: 4^n (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) * 2^{2n +1} * (2n +1)! )

Simplify:

4^n = 2^{2n}, so denominator: 2^{2n} * 2^{2n +1} = 2^{4n +1}

Numerator: 2 * (2n)! * 2^{2n} (n! )^2

Denominator: 2^{4n +1} (2n +1) (2n +1)! )

Cancel out terms:

2^{2n} in numerator and denominator leaves 2^{2n} in denominator.

So numerator: 2 * (2n)! * (n! )^2

Denominator: 2^{2n +1} (2n +1) (2n +1)! )

But (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)! ), so denominator becomes 2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 (2n)! )

Therefore, the term simplifies to:

2 * (2n)! * (n! )^2 ) / (2^{2n +1} (2n +1)^2 (2n)! )) = (n! )^2 / (2^{2n} (2n +1)^2 )

But this is the same as the previous sum we had. So we end up with the same series sum_{n=0}^∞ (n! )^2 / (2^{2n} (2n +1)^2 ). Which brings us back to the same problem. Therefore, this approach doesn't help.

Given that all approaches lead back to the same series, which we can't resolve into elementary functions, perhaps the integral is related to known constants. Alternatively, perhaps there's a clever substitution or identity we're missing.

Let me think differently. The original integral is:

∫0^2 x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ) dx.

Notice that x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2} is the weight function for the beta distribution or related to the beta function. Specifically, the integral ∫0^2 x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2} dx is a beta function. Let’s compute that:

Let’s make substitution x = 2t, so dx = 2dt, limits from t=0 to t=1. Then, the integral becomes ∫0^1 (2t)^{-1/2} (2 -2t)^{-1/2} * 2 dt = ∫0^1 (2^{-1/2} t^{-1/2})(2^{-1/2} (1 -t)^{-1/2}) *2 dt = ∫0^1 2^{-1} t^{-1/2} (1 -t)^{-1/2} *2 dt = ∫0^1 t^{-1/2} (1 -t)^{-1/2} dt = B(1/2,1/2) = π.

So the integral of the weight function alone is π. But in our case, we have an additional factor of arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ). So perhaps this integral can be expressed in terms of π squared or some multiple of π.

Alternatively, consider that the original integral might be related to the integral of arcsin over a certain domain. Let’s recall that ∫ arcsin(z) dz can be integrated by parts. But in this case, the integrand is arcsin multiplied by a weight function.

Alternatively, consider changing variables to u = arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ). But we tried that earlier and it didn't help.

Alternatively, consider that the argument inside the arcsin is (1/2)√(x(2 -x)). Let’s denote this as sinθ. So set (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) = sinθ. Then, √(x(2 -x)) = 2 sinθ. Squaring both sides: x(2 -x) = 4 sin²θ. So 2x -x² =4 sin²θ → x² -2x +4 sin²θ =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± √(4 -16 sin²θ)]/2 = 1 ± √(1 -4 sin²θ). But this substitution might not be helpful.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the Dirichlet integral or other known integrals involving arcsin.

Alternatively, let's consider the original substitution x = 2 sin²θ. We had the integral transformed into 2 ∫0^{π/2} arcsin( sinθ cosθ ) dθ. Let’s make substitution phi = 2θ. Then, when theta=0, phi=0; theta=π/2, phi=π. dtheta = dphi/2. The integral becomes 2 ∫0^{π} arcsin( (1/2) sinphi ) * (dphi/2) = ∫0^{π} arcsin( (1/2) sinphi ) dphi.

Now, the integral is ∫0^{π} arcsin( (1/2) sinphi ) dphi. This integral is over a full period of the sine function. Since sin(phi) is symmetric around phi=π/2, we can write this as 2 ∫0^{π/2} arcsin( (1/2) sinphi ) dphi.

But this brings us back to the same integral. However, perhaps we can use the series expansion for arcsin(z) and integrate term by term. Let’s try that again.

arcsin(z) = z + (1/6)z^3 + (3/40)z^5 + ... for |z| ≤1. Here, z = (1/2) sinphi. So:

arcsin( (1/2) sinphi ) = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ) ( (1/2) sinphi )^{2k +1} }

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫0^{π} sum_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k)! / (4^k (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ) * (1/2)^{2k +1} sin^{2k +1}phi ] dphi.

Interchange sum and integral:

sum_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k)! / (4^k (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ) * (1/2)^{2k +1} ] ∫0^{π} sin^{2k +1}phi dphi.

But ∫0^{π} sin^{2k +1}phi dphi = 2 ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}phi dphi = 2 * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2) ) = sqrt(π) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2).

Using the same relations as before, Γ(k +1) = k! and Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π) (2k +1)! ) / (4^k k! 2^{2k +1} ). Wait, no. As before, Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π) (2k +1)! ) / (4^k k! 2^{k +1} ). Therefore, sqrt(π) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π) k! / ( sqrt(π) (2k +1)! ) / (4^k k! 2^{k +1} ) ) = 4^k 2^{k +1} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! ).

Wait, this seems similar to previous steps. Therefore, the integral ∫0^{π} sin^{2k +1}phi dphi = sqrt(π) k! / Γ(k + 3/2) = 4^k 2^{k +1} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! ).

Substituting back into the sum:

sum_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k)! / (4^k (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ) * (1/2)^{2k +1} ] * 4^k 2^{k +1} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! )

Simplify term by term:

Numerator: (2k)! * 4^k * 2^{k +1} (k! )^2

Denominator: 4^k (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) * 2^{2k +1} (2k +1)! )

Cancel out 4^k and (k! )^2:

Numerator: (2k)! * 2^{k +1}

Denominator: (2k +1) * 2^{2k +1} (2k +1)! )

Simplify exponents:

2^{k +1} / 2^{2k +1} = 2^{-k}

So term becomes (2k)! * 2^{-k} / ( (2k +1) (2k +1)! ) )

But (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! ), so denominator becomes (2k +1)^2 (2k)! )

Therefore, term simplifies to 2^{-k} / ( (2k +1)^2 )

Thus, the sum is sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/( (2k +1)^2 2^k )

This is a different series than before. Wait, previously we had sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(4^k (2k +1)^2 ), but now it's sum_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2^k (2k +1)^2 ). This is a different series. However, this still doesn't have a known closed-form expression in terms of elementary constants. Therefore, it seems that despite various substitutions and expansions, the integral reduces to a series that doesn't have a simple closed-form. However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. This suggests that there might be a trick or identity that I'm missing.

Let me revisit the original integral:

∫0^2 x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2} arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ) dx.

Notice that the integrand contains x^{-1/2}(2 -x)^{-1/2}, which is the same as 1/√(x(2 -x)). So the integrand is [1/√(x(2 -x))] * arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ).

Let’s make substitution t = √(x(2 -x))/2. Then, t = √(x(2 -x))/2. As before, t ranges from 0 to 1/2 as x goes from 0 to 2. Let’s express x in terms of t. From t = √(x(2 -x))/2, squaring both sides: t² = x(2 -x)/4 → 4t² = 2x -x² → x² -2x +4t² =0 → x = [2 ± √(4 -16t²)]/2 = 1 ± √(1 -4t²). Since x must be between 0 and 2, both roots are valid. However, this substitution leads to two branches. Let’s consider x = 1 + √(1 -4t²) and x = 1 - √(1 -4t²). The derivative dx/dt would be ± ( -4t ) / (2√(1 -4t²)) ) = ∓ 2t / √(1 -4t²). But since x increases from 0 to 2, we need to consider both branches. However, this might complicate the integral. Alternatively, since the integrand is symmetric around x=1, perhaps we can split the integral into two parts from 0 to1 and 1 to2, and use substitution in each part.

Let’s split the integral into two parts: ∫0^1 + ∫1^2. For the first part, x=0 to1, set x =1 - √(1 -4t²), and for the second part, x=1 to2, set x=1 + √(1 -4t²). But this might not help. Alternatively, consider that the substitution t = √(x(2 -x))/2 leads to t ranging from 0 to 1/2, and each x corresponds to two t's. However, the integrand is symmetric around x=1, so perhaps the integral can be written as 2 ∫0^1 [1/√(x(2 -x))] arcsin( (1/2)√(x(2 -x)) ) dx.

Let’s proceed with this substitution. Let’s set t = √(x(2 -x))/2. Then, when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=√(1*1)/2=1/2. So for x from 0 to1, t from0 to1/2. Then, dx in terms of dt. From t = √(x(2 -x))/2, squaring: 4t² = 2x -x² → x² -2x +4t² =0. Differentiating both sides: 2x dx -2 dx +8t dt =0 → dx(2x -2) = -8t dt → dx = -8t dt / (2x -2) = 4t dt / (1 -x).

But x =1 ± √(1 -4t²). For x in [0,1], x =1 - √(1 -4t²). Therefore, 1 -x = √(1 -4t²). So dx =4t dt / √(1 -4t²).

Therefore, the integral from x=0 to1 becomes ∫0^{1/2} [1/√(x(2 -x))] arcsin(2t) * (4t / √(1 -4t²)) dt.

But x(2 -x) =4t², so √(x(2 -x))=2t. Therefore, 1/√(x(2 -x)) =1/(2t). Therefore, the integrand becomes (1/(2t)) * arcsin(2t) * (4t / √(1 -4t²)) dt = (1/(2t)) * arcsin(2t) *4t / √(1 -4t²) dt = 2 arcsin(2t) / √(1 -4t²) dt.

Therefore, the integral from x=0 to1 is 2 ∫0^{1/2} arcsin(2t) / √(1 -4t²) dt. Similarly, the integral from x=1 to2 is the same due to symmetry, so the total integral is 2 * 2 ∫0^{1/2} arcsin(2t) / √(1 -4t²) dt =4 ∫0^{1/2} arcsin(2t) / √(1 -4t²) dt.

Let’s make substitution u =2t. Then, t=u/2, dt=du/2. Limits from u=0 to u=1. The integral becomes4 ∫0^1 arcsin(u) / √(1 -u²) * (du/2) =2 ∫0^1 arcsin(u) / √(1 -u²) du.

Now, this integral is 2 ∫0^1 arcsin(u) / √(1 -u²) du. Let’s make substitution v = arcsin(u). Then, u=sinv, du=cosv dv. When u=0, v=0; u=1, v=π/2. The integral becomes 2 ∫0^{π/2} v / sqrt(1 - sin²v) * cosv dv =2 ∫0^{π/2} v / cosv * cosv dv =2 ∫0^{π/2} v dv =2 [v²/2 ]0^{π/2} =2*(π²/8 -0) = π²/4.

Therefore, the original integral evaluates to π²/4.

Wait, this is a breakthrough! Let me verify this step-by-step:

After substitution, the integral became 2 ∫0^1 arcsin(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Then, substitution v = arcsin(u), leading to 2 ∫0^{π/2} v dv =2*(π²/8) = π²/4. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the original integral is π²/4.

Therefore, the exact answer is π²/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately (3.1415926536)^2 /4 ≈ 9.8696044011 /4 ≈ 2.4674011003. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 2.4674011003.

So the final answer is π²/4 with numerical value approximately 2.4674011003.
