Okay, I need to compute the definite integral of 1/(2 + cos x) from 0 to 5π/2. Let me start by recalling how to integrate functions of the form 1/(a + b cos x). I remember there's a standard technique using the Weierstrass substitution, which is t = tan(x/2). That substitution converts the integral into a rational function of t, which might be easier to handle.

First, let me write down the integral: ∫₀^{5π/2} dx/(2 + cos x). 

Using the substitution t = tan(x/2), then dx = 2 dt/(1 + t²), and cos x = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²). Let me substitute these into the integral. 

So the denominator becomes 2 + (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) = [2(1 + t²) + 1 - t²]/(1 + t²) = [2 + 2t² + 1 - t²]/(1 + t²) = (3 + t²)/(1 + t²). 

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/( (3 + t²)/(1 + t²) ) ] * [2 dt/(1 + t²)] = ∫ [ (1 + t²)/(3 + t²) ) ] * [2 dt/(1 + t²) ] = ∫ 2/(3 + t²) dt. 

That simplifies to 2 ∫ dt/(t² + (√3)²). The integral of 1/(t² + a²) dt is (1/a) arctan(t/a) + C. So here, a = √3, so the integral becomes 2*(1/√3) arctan(t/√3) + C = (2/√3) arctan(t/√3) + C. 

Now, substituting back t = tan(x/2), the antiderivative is (2/√3) arctan( tan(x/2)/√3 ) + C. 

So the definite integral from 0 to 5π/2 is [ (2/√3) arctan( tan( (5π/2)/2 ) /√3 ) ] - [ (2/√3) arctan( tan(0/2)/√3 ) ].

Let me compute the upper limit first: x = 5π/2. Then x/2 = 5π/4. So tan(5π/4) = tan(π + π/4) = tan(π/4) = 1. But tan(5π/4) is actually 1, but wait, tan(π + π/4) is tan(π/4) which is 1, but since it's in the third quadrant, tan is positive there, so yes, tan(5π/4) = 1. Wait, no: tan(5π/4) is tan(π/4 + π) = tan(π/4) = 1, but since the period of tan is π, so tan(5π/4) = tan(π/4) = 1. Wait, but 5π/4 is 180 + 45 degrees, so in the third quadrant, where tan is positive. So tan(5π/4) = 1. So upper limit becomes arctan(1/√3). 

Wait, arctan(tan(5π/4)/√3) = arctan(1/√3). But arctan(1/√3) is π/6. But wait, tan(π/6) = 1/√3. So arctan(1/√3) = π/6. But wait, but the original angle here is 5π/4 divided by 2, which is 5π/8. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substitution is t = tan(x/2). So when x = 5π/2, then x/2 = 5π/4. So tan(x/2) = tan(5π/4) = 1. So the upper limit in terms of t is 1. So arctan(t/√3) evaluated at t=1 is arctan(1/√3) = π/6. 

But wait, the antiderivative is (2/√3) arctan(t/√3), where t is tan(x/2). So when x=5π/2, t=1, so upper limit is (2/√3) * π/6. 

Lower limit: x=0, so t=tan(0/2)=0. arctan(0/√3)=0. So the integral is (2/√3)(π/6 - 0) = (2/√3)(π/6) = π/(3√3). 

Wait, but wait, hold on. Because when we do substitution, we have to be careful about the periodicity of the tangent function. Because tan(x/2) is periodic with period 2π, but the original substitution is valid when x is not an odd multiple of π, but in the interval from 0 to 5π/2, x/2 goes from 0 to 5π/4. So tan(x/2) is defined except when x/2 = π/2 + kπ, which would be x=π + 2kπ. In our interval, x goes up to 5π/2, which is 2π + π/2, so x/2 goes up to 5π/4. So in this interval, x/2 is from 0 to 5π/4. The substitution is valid here except at x=π, where x/2=π/2, which is within the interval. So at x=π, tan(x/2) is tan(π/2), which is undefined. So the substitution might have a problem here. Wait, but the original integral is 1/(2 + cos x), which is continuous everywhere, so the integral is well-defined. Therefore, maybe the substitution is valid, but we need to split the integral at points where x/2 = π/2, i.e., x=π. So the integral from 0 to 5π/2 can be split into 0 to π, π to 3π, 3π to 5π/2? Wait, 5π/2 is 2.5π. Wait, 0 to 5π/2 is from 0 to 2.5π. So x=π is in the interval. So when x approaches π from below, tan(x/2) approaches infinity. So the substitution t = tan(x/2) would go to infinity as x approaches π from the left, and then from the right, x approaches π from above, t approaches negative infinity. Wait, but that complicates things. So perhaps the substitution as is isn't valid over the entire interval. Therefore, maybe we need to split the integral into intervals where tan(x/2) is continuous and the substitution is valid. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me recall that the integral of 1/(a + b cos x) dx can be expressed using the formula 2π/(sqrt(a² - b²)) when integrated over a period. But here, the interval is from 0 to 5π/2, which is 2.5 periods of cos x (since the period is 2π). But the integral over each period would be the same. Wait, but the integral of 1/(2 + cos x) over 0 to 2π is 2π/sqrt(3), because a=2, b=1, so sqrt(a² - b²)=sqrt(4-1)=sqrt(3). So over each 2π interval, the integral is 2π/sqrt(3). Then, over 0 to 5π/2, which is 2π + π/2, so the integral would be 2π/sqrt(3) + integral from 2π to 5π/2 of 1/(2 + cos x) dx. 

But maybe using the antiderivative we found earlier, but taking into account the discontinuities. Let me check again. The antiderivative is (2/√3) arctan(tan(x/2)/√3). But when x approaches π from below, x/2 approaches π/2, so tan(x/2) approaches infinity. So arctan(tan(x/2)/√3) approaches arctan(inf) = π/2. Then, when x crosses π, x/2 becomes greater than π/2, so tan(x/2) becomes negative (since x/2 is in (π/2, π) when x in (π, 2π)). Wait, but tan is positive in (0, π/2) and negative in (π/2, π). Wait, for x in (π, 2π), x/2 is in (π/2, π), so tan(x/2) is negative. But arctan can only give principal values between -π/2 and π/2. So when x is in (π, 2π), tan(x/2) is negative, so arctan of a negative number is negative. But the antiderivative should be continuous? Wait, maybe not. Because when x crosses π, the substitution might not be valid, so the antiderivative might have a jump. Therefore, we need to adjust the integral by considering the periodicity and the behavior of arctan. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the integrand is periodic with period 2π, so integrating over 0 to 5π/2 is the same as integrating over 0 to 2π multiplied by 2 full periods (which is 4π) plus the remaining π/2. Wait, 5π/2 is 2π + π/2. So the integral from 0 to 5π/2 is equal to the integral from 0 to 2π plus the integral from 2π to 5π/2. Since the function is periodic with period 2π, the integral from 2π to 5π/2 is the same as the integral from 0 to π/2. Therefore, the total integral is 2π/sqrt(3) + integral from 0 to π/2 of 1/(2 + cos x) dx. 

But then, if I compute the integral over 0 to π/2, I can use the same antiderivative. Let me check. Let's compute the integral from 0 to 2π first. Using the antiderivative (2/√3) arctan(tan(x/2)/√3), evaluated from 0 to 2π. At x=2π, x/2=π, tan(π)=0. Wait, tan(π/2) is undefined, but at x=2π, x/2=π, tan(π)=0. Wait, no: tan(π) is 0. So at x=2π, tan(x/2)=tan(π)=0. So upper limit is arctan(0/√3)=0. Lower limit at x=0 is arctan(0)=0. Wait, that can't be right. Because the integral from 0 to 2π should be 2π/sqrt(3), but according to this antiderivative, it's (2/√3)(0 - 0) = 0, which is wrong. So clearly, the antiderivative as written is not valid over intervals where x/2 crosses π/2. 

This suggests that the substitution t = tan(x/2) is not suitable for the entire interval from 0 to 5π/2 because of the discontinuity at x=π. Therefore, we need to split the integral into intervals where the substitution is valid, i.e., intervals where x/2 does not pass through π/2. So splitting the original integral at x=π. So the integral becomes ∫₀^π} dx/(2 + cos x) + ∫_{π}^{5π/2} dx/(2 + cos x). 

Let's compute the first integral from 0 to π. Using substitution t = tan(x/2), which is valid here because x/2 goes from 0 to π/2, so t goes from 0 to infinity. Wait, but integrating from t=0 to t=∞. Hmm, but when x approaches π from below, t approaches infinity. So the integral from 0 to π would be (2/√3)[ arctan(t/√3) ] from t=0 to t=∞. Which is (2/√3)(π/2 - 0) = (2/√3)(π/2) = π/√3. 

Then, the second integral from π to 5π/2. Let's make the substitution here. Let me use the substitution t = tan(x/2) again. But when x is in (π, 5π/2), x/2 is in (π/2, 5π/4). So tan(x/2) is negative in (π/2, π) and positive in (π, 5π/4). Wait, no: x/2 in (π/2, 5π/4) is equivalent to x in (π, 5π/2). So tan(x/2) is negative when x/2 is in (π/2, π), i.e., x in (π, 2π), and positive when x/2 is in (π, 5π/4), i.e., x in (2π, 5π/2). So the substitution t = tan(x/2) would have t negative in (π, 2π) and positive in (2π, 5π/2). However, the integral from π to 5π/2 can be split into π to 2π and 2π to 5π/2. 

Alternatively, since the integrand is periodic with period 2π, the integral from π to 5π/2 is the same as the integral from -π to π/2. But maybe that's complicating. Let me instead split the integral into π to 2π and 2π to 5π/2. 

First, integral from π to 2π. Let's use substitution t = tan(x/2). Then, when x=π, t=tan(π/2) which is undefined. Wait, but x=π, x/2=π/2, so tan(π/2) is infinity. So approaching from the right, x approaches π from above, x/2 approaches π/2 from above, so tan(x/2) approaches negative infinity. Wait, no. For x slightly greater than π, x/2 is slightly greater than π/2, which is in the second quadrant where tan is negative. Wait, no: in the second quadrant (π/2, π), tan is negative. So tan(x/2) when x approaches π from above, x/2 approaches π/2 from above, so tan(x/2) approaches negative infinity. Similarly, at x=2π, x/2=π, tan(π)=0. So the substitution from π to 2π would have t going from -infty to 0. 

So the integral from π to 2π of dx/(2 + cos x) becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 [2/(3 + t²)] dt. Because when x is in (π, 2π), t is negative, but the substitution still holds. The integral of 2/(3 + t²) from -infty to 0 is the same as from 0 to ∞, since the integrand is even. So that integral is (2/√3) [ arctan(t/√3) ] from -infty to 0. Which is (2/√3)[ arctan(0) - arctan(-infty) ] = (2/√3)[0 - (-π/2)] = (2/√3)(π/2) = π/√3. 

Then, the integral from 2π to 5π/2. Let's make substitution t = tan(x/2). Here, x goes from 2π to 5π/2, so x/2 goes from π to 5π/4. So tan(x/2) is tan(π) to tan(5π/4). tan(π)=0, tan(5π/4)=1. So t goes from 0 to 1. So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} 2/(3 + t²) dt. Which is (2/√3)[ arctan(t/√3) ] from 0 to 1. Which is (2/√3)( arctan(1/√3) - 0 ) = (2/√3)(π/6) = π/(3√3). 

So adding up all the parts: integral from 0 to π is π/√3, integral from π to 2π is π/√3, integral from 2π to 5π/2 is π/(3√3). So total integral is π/√3 + π/√3 + π/(3√3) = (2π/√3) + (π)/(3√3) = (6π + π)/3√3 = 7π/(3√3). 

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The integral from 0 to π is π/√3. The integral from π to 2π is also π/√3. Then the integral from 2π to 5π/2 is π/(3√3). So total is π/√3 + π/√3 + π/(3√3) = (2π/√3) + (π/3√3) = (6π + π)/3√3) = 7π/(3√3). 

But wait, 5π/2 is 2π + π/2. So the integral from 2π to 5π/2 is the same as from 0 to π/2. Let me verify that. The integral from 2π to 5π/2 is over x in [2π, 5π/2]. Let me substitute y = x - 2π. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(2 + cos(y + 2π)) dy = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(2 + cos y) dy. Which is the same as the integral from 0 to π/2. 

But earlier, when we computed the integral from 2π to 5π/2 using substitution, we got π/(3√3). So the integral from 0 to π/2 of 1/(2 + cos x) dx is π/(3√3). Let me check that. Using substitution t = tan(x/2) from 0 to π/2. Then x goes from 0 to π/2, t goes from 0 to tan(π/4) = 1. So the integral is ∫₀¹ 2/(3 + t²) dt = (2/√3) arctan(t/√3) from 0 to 1 = (2/√3)( arctan(1/√3) - 0 ) = (2/√3)(π/6) = π/(3√3). So that's correct. 

Therefore, the total integral is indeed π/√3 + π/√3 + π/(3√3) = 7π/(3√3). 

Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator, 7π/(3√3) = 7π√3 / 9. Wait, 7π/(3√3) = (7π√3)/(3*3) = 7π√3/9. So exact answer is 7π/(3√3) or 7√3 π/9. 

Now, let me compute the numerical approximation. First, compute π ≈ 3.1415926536. Then √3 ≈ 1.7320508076. So 7 * 1.7320508076 ≈ 12.1243556532. Multiply by π: 12.1243556532 * 3.1415926536 ≈ let's compute that. 

12 * 3.1415926536 ≈ 37.699111843, 0.1243556532 * 3.1415926536 ≈ 0.390699. So total ≈ 37.699111843 + 0.390699 ≈ 38.0898108. Then divide by 9: 38.0898108 / 9 ≈ 4.2322012. 

Alternatively, compute 7π/(3√3): π ≈ 3.1415926536, 7π ≈ 21.9911485752. 3√3 ≈ 5.1961524227. So 21.9911485752 / 5.1961524227 ≈ 4.2322010967. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 4.2322010967. So approximately 4.2322010967. 

But let me verify this with a calculator. Let me compute 7 * π / (3 * sqrt(3)):

7 * 3.141592653589793 = 21.99114857512855

3 * 1.7320508075688772 = 5.196152422706632

21.99114857512855 / 5.196152422706632 ≈ 4.232201096733455

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 4.2322010967.

So the numerical approximation is approximately 4.2322010967.

Therefore, the exact answer is 7π/(3√3), which can be written as \frac{7\pi}{3\sqrt{3}} or rationalized as \frac{7\sqrt{3}\pi}{9}. Both are correct, but the first form is simpler. 

So the problem is solved. The steps involved splitting the integral into three parts where the substitution is valid, computing each part, and summing them up. The final exact answer is 7π/(3√3), and the numerical approximation is approximately 4.2322010967.
