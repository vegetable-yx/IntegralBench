Okay, let's tackle this integral: ∫₀² x^(-1/2) cos(1 * √[4]{x(2 - x)}) dx. Hmm, first, I need to compute this analytically. The integrand is x^(-1/2) times the cosine of the fourth root of x(2 - x). The limits are from 0 to 2. 

Let me see. The presence of x(2 - x) inside the fourth root suggests maybe a substitution that can simplify that term. The expression x(2 - x) is a quadratic, which might relate to a trigonometric identity or a substitution that can make the integral more manageable. Also, the x^(-1/2) term is like 1/√x, which often pairs with substitutions that have √x in them.

Let me try a substitution. Let’s set t = √x. Then, x = t², so dx = 2t dt. Let's see how that affects the integral. When x=0, t=0; x=2, t=√2. Substitute into the integral:

∫₀^√2 (t²)^(-1/2) * cos( (t²(2 - t²))^(1/4) ) * 2t dt.

Simplify the exponents: (t²)^(-1/2) is t^(-1), so multiplying by 2t gives 2t * t^(-1) = 2. So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( (t²(2 - t²))^(1/4) ) dt. Wait, that simplifies the integrand a lot. Now the integrand is just 2 cos( [t²(2 - t²)]^(1/4 ) ) dt. 

But [t²(2 - t²)]^(1/4) can be written as [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Let me see if that simplifies. Let's compute the fourth root of t²(2 - t²). Let's write that as [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} = [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Hmm, maybe another substitution here. Let me set u = t². Then, du = 2t dt, but I don't know if that helps. Wait, but in the current integral, after substitution t, we have 2 ∫ cos( [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} ) dt, but u is t². Maybe not. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, let's look at the expression inside the cosine: [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Let's see, t²(2 - t²) = 2t² - t^4. Maybe another substitution here. Let me set y = t². Then, dy = 2t dt. Wait, but in the current substitution, we have t as the variable. Let me check:

Wait, after the first substitution t = √x, the integral became 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} ) dt. Let me compute the argument of the cosine: [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} = [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Let me compute t²(2 - t²):

t²(2 - t²) = 2t² - t^4. Hmm, maybe completing the square or another substitution. Let's see, 2t² - t^4 = -t^4 + 2t² = -(t^4 - 2t²) = -(t² - 1)^2 + 1. Wait, let's check:

t^4 - 2t² = (t²)^2 - 2t² = (t² - 1)^2 - 1. So, that's (t² - 1)^2 - 1. Therefore, 2t² - t^4 = -[(t² - 1)^2 - 1] = - (t² -1)^2 +1 = 1 - (t² -1)^2. So, the expression inside the fourth root becomes [1 - (t² -1)^2]^{1/4}. Hmm, that looks like a trigonometric identity. Because 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ, so maybe if we set t² -1 = sinθ or something. But this is getting complicated. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t² -1. Then, du = 2t dt. But in the integral, we have dt, not t dt. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe set θ such that t² -1 = sinθ. Then, 1 - (t² -1)^2 = 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ. Then, [1 - (t² -1)^2]^{1/4} = (cos²θ)^{1/4} = cos^{1/2}θ. But I need to see if this substitution helps. Let me try:

Let’s set u = t² -1. Then, du = 2t dt. But in the integral, after substitution t, we have 2 ∫ cos( [1 - u²]^{1/4} ) dt. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution for the entire argument of the cosine. Let’s set z = [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Then, z^4 = t²(2 - t²). Maybe differentiating z with respect to t could lead to a relation. Let's compute dz/dt:

dz/dt = (1/4)[t²(2 - t²)]^{-3/4} * [2t(2 - t²) + t²(-2t)] 

Simplify the derivative inside:

2t(2 - t²) - 2t³ = 4t - 2t³ - 2t³ = 4t -4t³ = 4t(1 - t²)

So, dz/dt = (1/4) [t²(2 - t²)]^{-3/4} * 4t(1 - t²) = [t²(2 - t²)]^{-3/4} * t(1 - t²)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe not helpful. Let's see if there's another approach.

Wait, the integral after substitution t = √x is 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} ) dt. Let me check the limits. When t goes from 0 to √2, then t² goes from 0 to 2. So, the expression inside the cosine is [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4}. Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set u = t². Then, du = 2t dt. But in the integral, we have dt. So, dt = du/(2t) = du/(2√u). But substituting into the integral:

2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} ) dt = 2 ∫₀² cos( [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} ) * (du)/(2√u) ) = ∫₀² [1/√u] cos( [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} ) du.

Wait, but that's the original integral. Because u is just a dummy variable here. So that substitution brings us back to the original integral. So that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution that can symmetrize the integral. The original integral is from 0 to 2. The expression x(2 - x) is symmetric around x=1. Maybe substituting x = 2 - y. Let's try that. Let x = 2 - y, then when x=0, y=2; x=2, y=0. The integral becomes ∫₂⁰ (2 - y)^{-1/2} cos( [ (2 - y) y ]^{1/4} ) (-dy) = ∫₀² (2 - y)^{-1/2} cos( [ y(2 - y) ]^{1/4} ) dy. But since the variable is dummy, this shows that the integrand is symmetric. So, the integral from 0 to 2 is equal to twice the integral from 0 to 1, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, but the original integrand is x^{-1/2} cos( [x(2 - x)]^{1/4} ). After substitution x = 2 - y, we get (2 - y)^{-1/2} cos( [y(2 - y)]^{1/4} ). So the integral is the same as the original. So the function is symmetric around x=1. So maybe substitution t = x -1? Let me try t = x -1. Then, x = t +1, dx = dt. Limits from t = -1 to t=1. The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 (t +1)^{-1/2} cos( [ (t +1)(1 - t) ]^{1/4} ) dt. Simplify the expression inside the cosine: (t +1)(1 - t) = 1 - t². So, the argument of the cosine becomes (1 - t²)^{1/4}. So the integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 (t +1)^{-1/2} cos( (1 - t²)^{1/4} ) dt. Hmm, but this might not be easier. However, since the integrand is even or odd? Let's check. If we replace t with -t, the term (t +1)^{-1/2} becomes (-t +1)^{-1/2}, which is not symmetric. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, since the integrand is symmetric around x=1, perhaps substitution t = 1 - x. Let me see. Let t = 1 - x. Then, x = 1 - t, dx = -dt. When x=0, t=1; x=2, t=-1. The integral becomes ∫₁^{-1} (1 - t)^{-1/2} cos( [ (1 - t)(1 + t) ]^{1/4} ) (-dt) = ∫_{-1}^1 (1 - t)^{-1/2} cos( (1 - t²)^{1/4} ) dt. Which is similar to the previous substitution. Still not obvious.

Wait, but the integrand now is (1 - t)^{-1/2} cos( (1 - t²)^{1/4} ). Hmm. Let me see if combining the two substitutions. Let me think of the integral after substitution t = sinθ. Let’s try that. Let’s set t = sinθ. Then, dt = cosθ dθ. The limits: when t=-1, θ=-π/2; t=1, θ=π/2. The integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (1 - sinθ)^{-1/2} cos( (1 - sin²θ)^{1/4} ) cosθ dθ. Simplify 1 - sin²θ = cos²θ, so (1 - sin²θ)^{1/4} = (cos²θ)^{1/4} = cos^{1/2}θ. So the argument of the cosine becomes cos^{1/2}θ. So the integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (1 - sinθ)^{-1/2} cos( cos^{1/2}θ ) cosθ dθ. Hmm, this seems complicated. The term (1 - sinθ)^{-1/2} can be written as [ (1 - sinθ) ]^{-1/2}. Let me rationalize 1 - sinθ. Recall that 1 - sinθ = (sin(θ/2) - cos(θ/2))². But maybe using the identity 1 - sinθ = 2 sin²( (π/4 - θ/2) ). Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sinθ)^{1/2}:

(1 - sinθ)^{-1/2} = [ (1 - sinθ)(1 + sinθ) ]^{-1/2} (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} = (1 - sin²θ)^{-1/2} (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} = (cos²θ)^{-1/2} (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} = (1/cosθ) (1 + sinθ)^{1/2}. But since we are in the integral from -π/2 to π/2, cosθ is positive, so that's okay. So substituting back:

(1 - sinθ)^{-1/2} = (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} / cosθ. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} [ (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} / cosθ ] * cos( cos^{1/2}θ ) * cosθ dθ = ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} cos( cos^{1/2}θ ) dθ.

Simplify: The cosθ in the denominator cancels with the cosθ from the substitution. So we have ∫ (1 + sinθ)^{1/2} cos( cos^{1/2}θ ) dθ from -π/2 to π/2. Hmm, this doesn't seem to lead to an obvious simplification. Maybe this path is not helpful.

Let me think again. The original integral after substitution t = √x became 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} ) dt. Let me compute [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} again. Let's write t² = u, so u ranges from 0 to 2. Then, [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} = [2u - u²]^{1/4}. Maybe another substitution here. Let me set v = u -1, so that 2u - u² = - (u² - 2u) = - ( (u -1)^2 -1 ) = 1 - (u -1)^2. So, [2u - u²]^{1/4} = [1 - (u -1)^2]^{1/4}. So, the argument of the cosine is [1 - (u -1)^2]^{1/4}. Let me set u -1 = sinφ. Then, 1 - (u -1)^2 = cos²φ, so [1 - (u -1)^2]^{1/4} = cos^{1/2}φ. Then, du = cosφ dφ. When u=0, sinφ = -1, so φ = -π/2; when u=2, sinφ =1, so φ=π/2. But u ranges from 0 to 2, so φ ranges from -π/2 to π/2. Wait, substituting back into the integral:

Original integral after substitution t = √x is 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [u(2 - u)]^{1/4} ) dt, where u = t². Wait, but u = t², so t = sqrt(u). So dt = (1/(2√u)) du. Wait, no, earlier substitution was t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then, the integral became 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [t²(2 - t²)]^{1/4} ) dt. So here, u = t², but t is the variable. So maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to proceed with the substitution u = t² -1. Wait, no. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution z = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Let me set z = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Then, z^4 = x(2 - x). Let's differentiate both sides:

4z^3 dz = (2 - 2x) dx. Hmm, but the integrand is x^{-1/2} cos(z) dx. Let me see if I can express dx in terms of dz. From z^4 = x(2 - x), we can write this as x^2 - 2x + z^4 =0. Wait, no. Let's solve for x in terms of z. z^4 = 2x - x². So x² - 2x + z^4 =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4z^4)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - z^4). Hmm, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, differentiating z^4 = 2x -x²:

4z^3 dz = (2 - 2x) dx => dx = (4z^3 dz)/(2 - 2x) = (2z^3 dz)/(1 - x). But x is expressed in terms of z, which complicates things. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts. Let me consider integrating x^{-1/2} cos(...). Let u = x^{-1/2}, dv = cos(...) dx. But the problem is that the argument of the cosine is a function of x, which complicates the integration. So integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Wait, let's go back to the substitution t = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Let me try that. Let t = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Then, t^4 = x(2 - x). Let's differentiate both sides:

4t^3 dt = (2 - 2x) dx. So, dx = (4t^3 dt)/(2 - 2x). But x is related to t via t^4 = x(2 - x). Let me solve for x in terms of t. Rearranging t^4 = 2x -x² => x² -2x + t^4 =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4t^4)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - t^4). So x = 1 + sqrt(1 - t^4) or 1 - sqrt(1 - t^4). Hmm, but since x is between 0 and 2, both solutions are possible depending on t. However, when x is between 0 and 2, t^4 = x(2 -x) is between 0 and 1 (since x(2 -x) has maximum at x=1, where it's 1). So t ranges from 0 to 1. So when t=0, x=0 or 2. When t=1, x=1. So perhaps for x from 0 to1, x=1 - sqrt(1 - t^4), and from 1 to2, x=1 + sqrt(1 - t^4). But this complicates the substitution. Maybe split the integral into two parts: from 0 to1 and 1 to2. But this might not help. Alternatively, since the integrand is symmetric around x=1, maybe express the integral as 2 times the integral from 0 to1. Let me check:

Original integral ∫₀² x^{-1/2} cos([x(2 -x)]^{1/4}) dx. Let’s split into ∫₀¹ + ∫₁². Let’s substitute x = 2 - y in the second integral. Then, ∫₁² becomes ∫₀¹ (2 - y)^{-1/2} cos([ (2 - y) y ]^{1/4} ) dy. Which is the same as ∫₀¹ (2 - y)^{-1/2} cos([ y(2 - y) ]^{1/4} ) dy. But since the original integrand is symmetric, this is the same as ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos([x(2 -x)]^{1/4}) dx. So the total is 2 ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos([x(2 -x)]^{1/4}) dx. So maybe this helps. But not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider changing variables to θ, where x = 2 sin²θ. Let me try that. Let x = 2 sin²θ. Then, dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. When x=0, θ=0; x=2, θ=π/2. Substitute into the integral:

∫₀^{π/2} (2 sin²θ)^{-1/2} cos( [2 sin²θ (2 - 2 sin²θ) ]^{1/4} ) *4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Simplify the terms:

(2 sin²θ)^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} (sinθ)^{-1}. Then, multiplying by 4 sinθ cosθ gives 4 / √2 * cosθ. So 4/√2 = 2√2. So the integral becomes 2√2 ∫₀^{π/2} cos( [2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ ]^{1/4} ) cosθ dθ.

Simplify the argument inside the cosine:

2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ = (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 = (sin2θ)^2. Wait, 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ, so squared is sin²2θ. So the argument becomes [4 sin²θ cos²θ]^{1/4} = [ (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 ]^{1/4} = (2 sinθ cosθ)^{1/2} = √(2 sinθ cosθ) = √(sin2θ). So the integral becomes 2√2 ∫₀^{π/2} cos( √(sin2θ) ) cosθ dθ.

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me check:

Wait, [4 sin²θ cos²θ]^{1/4} = (4)^{1/4} (sinθ cosθ)^{1/2} = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^{1/2} = √2 ( (sin2θ)/2 )^{1/2} = √2 * (sin2θ)^{1/2} / √2 = (sin2θ)^{1/2}. So the argument of the cosine is (sin2θ)^{1/2} = sin^{1/2}2θ. So the integral becomes 2√2 ∫₀^{π/2} cos( sin^{1/2}2θ ) cosθ dθ. Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution here. Let’s set φ = 2θ. Then, when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. dφ = 2 dθ, so dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes 2√2 ∫₀^π cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) cos(φ/2) * (dφ/2) ) = √2 ∫₀^π cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) cos(φ/2) dφ. Still complicated.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let’s set u = sin^{1/2}φ. Then, du = (1/2) sin^{-1/2}φ cosφ dφ. But this seems not helpful. Alternatively, maybe expand the cosine in a power series and integrate term by term. Let me consider that.

The integrand is x^{-1/2} cos( [x(2 -x)]^{1/4} ). Let me expand the cosine as a Taylor series: cos(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n}/(2n)! where z = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4}. So the integrand becomes x^{-1/2} Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n [x(2 -x)]^{n/2}/(2n)! ). Then, the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n)! ∫₀² x^{-1/2} [x(2 -x)]^{n/2} dx. Simplify the integrand: x^{-1/2} [x(2 -x)]^{n/2} = x^{-1/2} x^{n/2} (2 -x)^{n/2} = x^{(n -1)/2} (2 -x)^{n/2}. So the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n)! ∫₀² x^{(n -1)/2} (2 -x)^{n/2} dx.

This integral looks like a Beta function or Gamma function. Let me check. The integral ∫₀² x^{(n -1)/2} (2 -x)^{n/2} dx. Let’s make a substitution t = x/2, so x = 2t, dx = 2dt. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (2t)^{(n -1)/2} (2 - 2t)^{n/2} * 2 dt = 2^{(n -1)/2 + n/2 +1} ∫₀¹ t^{(n -1)/2} (1 - t)^{n/2} dt. Simplify the exponent: (n -1)/2 + n/2 = (2n -1)/2. So 2^{(2n -1)/2 +1} = 2^{(2n +1)/2} = 2^{n + 1/2}. The integral becomes 2^{n + 1/2} ∫₀¹ t^{(n -1)/2} (1 - t)^{n/2} dt. The integral is the Beta function B( (n +1)/2, (n/2) +1 ). Which is equal to Γ( (n +1)/2 ) Γ( n/2 +1 ) / Γ( (3n +3)/2 ). Wait, no. The Beta function B(a,b) = ∫₀¹ t^{a-1} (1 - t)^{b-1} dt = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So here, a = (n -1)/2 +1 = (n +1)/2, and b = n/2 +1. So B( (n +1)/2, n/2 +1 ) = Γ( (n +1)/2 ) Γ( n/2 +1 ) / Γ( (n +1)/2 + n/2 +1 ) = Γ( (n +1)/2 ) Γ( n/2 +1 ) / Γ( (2n +3)/2 ). 

Therefore, the integral becomes 2^{n + 1/2} * Γ( (n +1)/2 ) Γ( n/2 +1 ) / Γ( (2n +3)/2 ). 

Putting this back into the series, the original integral is Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n)! * 2^{n + 1/2} * Γ( (n +1)/2 ) Γ( n/2 +1 ) / Γ( (2n +3)/2 ). 

This seems very complicated. However, for specific values of n, the Gamma functions can be simplified. For example, when n is even or odd. Let’s check for n even and odd separately. Let’s set n = 2k or n = 2k +1. But this might not lead to a closed-form expression. 

Alternatively, perhaps there is a substitution that can convert the original integral into a Bessel function. The integral ∫₀² x^{-1/2} cos( [x(2 -x)]^{1/4} ) dx. Let me recall that Bessel functions can be expressed as integrals involving trigonometric functions. For example, J_0(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(z sinθ) dθ. But I'm not sure if this directly relates. 

Alternatively, consider the substitution u = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4}. Let me try again. Let u = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4}. Then, u^4 = x(2 -x). Differentiating both sides: 4u^3 du = (2 - 2x) dx. So, dx = (4u^3 du)/(2 - 2x). But x can be expressed in terms of u. From u^4 = 2x -x², we have x² -2x +u^4 =0. Solving for x: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4u^4)]/2 =1 ± sqrt(1 -u^4). So x =1 + sqrt(1 -u^4) or x=1 - sqrt(1 -u^4). Since x ranges from 0 to2, when u increases from 0 to1, x decreases from 2 to1 (for the plus sign) and increases from0 to1 (for the minus sign). Therefore, the substitution splits the integral into two parts. Let me consider the integral from0 to1 and1 to2 separately.

For x from0 to1: x=1 - sqrt(1 -u^4). Then, dx = ( (1/2)(1 -u^4)^{-1/2} *4u^3 ) du = (2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4)) du. Similarly, for x from1 to2: x=1 + sqrt(1 -u^4), dx= -2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) du. But since we are integrating from1 to2, the negative sign will invert the limits. So the total integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4)] du + ∫₁⁰ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [ -2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) ] du.

But this is messy. Let me see:

Wait, when x is from0 to1, u goes from0 to1 (since at x=0, u=0; x=1, u=1). Similarly, when x is from1 to2, u goes from1 to0. So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4)] du + ∫¹₀ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [ -2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) ] du.

But the second integral is from1 to0, so flipping the limits:

= ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4)] du + ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} cos(u) [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) ] du.

But x in the first integral is x=1 - sqrt(1 -u^4), and in the second integral x=1 + sqrt(1 -u^4). So the total integral is:

∫₀¹ [ (1 - sqrt(1 -u^4))^{-1/2} + (1 + sqrt(1 -u^4))^{-1/2} ] * cos(u) * [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) ] du.

This seems complicated, but maybe the term in brackets can be simplified. Let’s compute:

(1) = (1 - sqrt(1 -u^4))^{-1/2} + (1 + sqrt(1 -u^4))^{-1/2}

Let’s set s = sqrt(1 -u^4). Then, (1 - s)^{-1/2} + (1 + s)^{-1/2}. Let me rationalize each term:

(1 - s)^{-1/2} = [ (1 - s)^{-1} ]^{1/2} = [ (1 + s)/(1 - s^2) ]^{1/2} = sqrt( (1 + s)/(1 - s^2) ). Wait, but s = sqrt(1 -u^4), so s^2 =1 -u^4. Therefore, 1 - s^2 = u^4. So:

(1 - s)^{-1/2} = sqrt( (1 + s)/u^4 ) = sqrt(1 + s)/u². Similarly, (1 + s)^{-1/2} = sqrt(1 - s)/u². Therefore:

A1 = sqrt(1 + s)/u² + sqrt(1 - s)/u² = [ sqrt(1 + s) + sqrt(1 - s) ] / u².

But s = sqrt(1 -u^4). Let me compute sqrt(1 + s) + sqrt(1 - s):

Let’s compute [sqrt(1 + s) + sqrt(1 - s)]² = (1 + s) + (1 - s) + 2 sqrt{(1 + s)(1 - s)} = 2 + 2 sqrt{1 - s²} = 2 + 2 sqrt{1 - (1 -u^4)} = 2 + 2 sqrt{u^4} = 2 + 2u². Therefore, sqrt(1 + s) + sqrt(1 - s) = sqrt{2 + 2u²} = sqrt{2(1 +u²)} = √2 * sqrt(1 +u²). Therefore, A1 = √2 * sqrt(1 +u²) / u².

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ [√2 * sqrt(1 +u²) / u² ] * cos(u) * [2u^3 / sqrt(1 -u^4) ] du.

Simplify the terms:

√2 * 2(1 +u²)^{1/2} * 2u^3 / (u² * sqrt(1 -u^4)) ) = √2 * 2u^3 * sqrt(1 +u²) / (u² sqrt(1 -u^4)) ) = 2√2 u * sqrt(1 +u²) / sqrt(1 -u^4).

Simplify sqrt(1 +u²) / sqrt(1 -u^4) = sqrt( (1 +u²)/(1 -u^4) ) = sqrt( (1 +u²)/( (1 -u²)(1 +u²) )) = 1 / sqrt(1 -u²). Therefore, the integrand becomes 2√2 u / sqrt(1 -u²).

So the integral simplifies to 2√2 ∫₀¹ u / sqrt(1 -u²) cos(u) du.

Wow, that's a significant simplification! So after all those substitutions, the original integral reduces to 2√2 ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

Now, this integral looks more manageable. Let's tackle this integral: ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set t = sqrt(1 -u²). Then, t² =1 -u² => u² =1 -t² => u = sqrt(1 -t²). Differentiating: du = (-t)/sqrt(1 -t²) dt. When u=0, t=1; u=1, t=0. So the integral becomes:

∫₁⁰ [ sqrt(1 -t²) * cos(sqrt(1 -t²)) ] / t * (-t)/sqrt(1 -t²) dt. 

Wait, let's substitute step by step. The integral is:

∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

Set t = sqrt(1 -u²). Then, u = sqrt(1 -t²), du = (-t)/sqrt(1 -t²) dt. The limits change from u=0 (t=1) to u=1 (t=0). So:

∫₁⁰ [ sqrt(1 -t²) * cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) ] / t * (-t)/sqrt(1 -t²) dt.

Simplify the terms:

sqrt(1 -t²) in numerator and denominator cancels. The t in the denominator cancels with the -t from du. The negative sign from du flips the limits:

= ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt.

So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt.

Hmm, this is simpler. So the original integral is 2√2 times this integral. So:

Original integral = 2√2 ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt.

Now, how to compute ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Let me make another substitution. Let’s set v = sqrt(1 -t²). Then, v² =1 -t² => t = sqrt(1 -v²). dt = (-v)/sqrt(1 -v²) dv. When t=0, v=1; t=1, v=0. So the integral becomes:

∫₁⁰ cos(v) * (-v)/sqrt(1 -v²) dv = ∫₀¹ v cos(v) / sqrt(1 -v²) dv.

Wait, but this brings us back to the same integral we had before. So this substitution doesn't help. Hmm. So we have:

Original integral = 2√2 ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt.

Let me consider expanding cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) into a Taylor series. The Taylor series for cos(z) is Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n}/(2n)!. So substituting z = sqrt(1 -t²):

cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n (1 -t²)^n / (2n)!.

Then, the integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n)! ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^n dt.

The integral ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^n dt is a Beta function. Let’s compute it. Let’s set t = sinθ, then dt = cosθ dθ. When t=0, θ=0; t=1, θ=π/2. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (cos²θ)^n cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} cos^{2n +1}θ dθ. This is known as the Beta function: ∫₀^{π/2} cos^{2n +1}θ dθ = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n +1)/Γ(n + 3/2).

Alternatively, using the formula for the Beta function: ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^n dt = 1/2 B(1/2, n +1) = 1/2 Γ(1/2)Γ(n +1)/Γ(n + 3/2). Since Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), this becomes sqrt(π)/2 * n! / Γ(n + 3/2).

But Γ(n + 3/2) can be expressed as (n + 1/2) Γ(n + 1/2). And Γ(n +1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ). So:

Γ(n + 3/2) = (n +1/2) * (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ) = ( (2n +1)/2 ) * (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ).

Therefore, sqrt(π)/2 * n! / Γ(n + 3/2) = sqrt(π)/2 * n! / [ (2n +1/2) (2n)! sqrt(π) / (4^n n! )) ] = sqrt(π)/2 * n! * 4^n n! / [ (2n +1)/2 * (2n)! sqrt(π) ) ] = (sqrt(π)/2) * (4^n (n! )² ) / ( (2n +1)/2 * (2n)! sqrt(π) ) ) = (4^n (n! )² ) / ( (2n +1) (2n)! ) ).

Simplifying, this becomes 4^n (n! )² / [ (2n +1) (2n)! ) ].

But (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n -1)!!, but not sure. Alternatively, using the duplication formula for Gamma functions. However, perhaps it's a better way to express this.

Alternatively, the integral ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^n dt can be expressed as (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n +1)/Γ(n + 3/2). So the integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n)! * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(n +1)/Γ(n + 3/2).

But Γ(n +1) = n! and Γ(n + 3/2) = (n +1/2) Γ(n +1/2). And Γ(n +1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ). So:

Γ(n + 3/2) = (n +1/2) * (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ).

Therefore, the term becomes:

sqrt(π)/2 * n! / [ (n +1/2) (2n)! sqrt(π) / 4^n n! ) ] = (sqrt(π)/2) * n! * 4^n n! / [ (n +1/2) (2n)! sqrt(π) ) ] = (4^n (n! )² ) / [ 2 (n +1/2) (2n)! ) ].

So the integral is Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (2n)! * 4^n (n! )² / [ 2 (n +1/2) (2n)! ) ].

This simplifies to Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n 4^n (n! )² / [ 2 (2n)! (2n)! ) (n +1/2) ) ].

This seems very complicated. Perhaps there's a better way to evaluate ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Let me consider another substitution. Let’s set w = sqrt(1 -t²). Then, t = sqrt(1 -w²), dt = -w / sqrt(1 -w²) dw. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ cos(w) * (-w)/sqrt(1 -w²) dw from w=1 to0, which is ∫₀¹ w cos(w) / sqrt(1 -w²) dw. But this is the same integral we had earlier. So we are going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let’s consider ∫ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Let u = cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ), dv = dt. Then, du = -sin( sqrt(1 -t²) ) * (1/(2 sqrt(1 -t²))) * (-2t) dt = t sin( sqrt(1 -t²) ) / sqrt(1 -t²) dt. And v = t. So integration by parts gives:

uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [t cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) ]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ t * [ t sin( sqrt(1 -t²) ) / sqrt(1 -t²) ] dt.

Evaluate the first term: at t=1, cos( sqrt(1 -1) ) = cos(0) =1; at t=0, cos( sqrt(1 -0) )=cos(1). So the first term is 1*1 -0*cos(1) =1. The integral becomes:

1 - ∫₀¹ t² sin( sqrt(1 -t²) ) / sqrt(1 -t²) dt.

Let me make a substitution in the integral: let u = sqrt(1 -t²). Then, t² =1 -u², dt = -u / sqrt(1 -u²) du. The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (1 -u²) sin(u) / u * (-u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du = ∫₁⁰ (1 -u²) sin(u) / u * (-u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du = ∫₀¹ (1 -u²) sin(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) sin(u) du.

So the integral becomes:

1 - ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) sin(u) du.

But this seems to not help much. Let me denote I = ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Then, from integration by parts, we have:

I =1 - ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) sin(u) du.

Now, let’s compute J = ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) sin(u) du. Let’s integrate J by parts. Let’s set v = sqrt(1 -u²), dw = sin(u) du. Then, dv = (-u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du, w = -cos(u). So:

J = -sqrt(1 -u²) cos(u) |₀¹ + ∫₀¹ [u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) ] du.

Evaluate the first term: at u=1, sqrt(1 -1)=0; at u=0, sqrt(1 -0. So the first term is 0 - (-1 * cos(0)) =0 - (-1 *1)=1. So J =1 + ∫₀¹ [u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) ] du.

But wait, we have:

I =1 - J =1 - [1 + ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du ] = - ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du.

But from earlier, we have:

Original integral =2√2 I =2√2 * [ - ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du ].

But from the previous result, J =1 + ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du, and I =1 - J = - ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du.

So Original integral =2√2 * (-I) =2√2 * ( - (- ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du )) =2√2 * ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du.

But this seems to lead us back to the same integral. This suggests that there's a relation between I and J, but not helpful for evaluation.

Given that all these substitutions and integration by parts are leading to circular references, perhaps the integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and requires a special function or a series expansion. However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. This suggests that there is an analytical solution, possibly involving known constants or functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be expressed in terms of Fresnel integrals or Bessel functions. Let me recall that the Fresnel integrals are of the form ∫ cos(t²) dt and ∫ sin(t²) dt, but not sure. Alternatively, Bessel functions have integral representations involving trigonometric functions. For example, the Bessel function of the first kind J_n(z) has an integral representation:

J_n(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(z sinθ -nθ) dθ.

But I'm not sure if this helps here.

Alternatively, consider the integral ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Let’s make a substitution θ = sqrt(1 -t²). Then, θ = sqrt(1 -t²) => θ² =1 -t² => t = sqrt(1 -θ²), dt = -θ / sqrt(1 -θ²) dθ. When t=0, θ=1; t=1, θ=0. So the integral becomes:

∫₁⁰ cos(θ) * (-θ)/sqrt(1 -θ²) dθ = ∫₀¹ θ cosθ / sqrt(1 -θ²) dθ.

But this is the same as the integral we had before. So again, no progress.

Given that all these methods are not yielding a closed-form expression, perhaps the integral is related to a known special function or can be a clever substitution that I'm not seeing. Alternatively, maybe the original integral can be expressed in terms of the Fresnel integral. Let me check the Fresnel integrals:

Fresnel integrals are S(z) = ∫₀^z sin( (π/2) t² ) dt and C(z) = ∫₀^z cos( (π/2) t² ) dt. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider the integral ∫₀¹ cos(a sqrt(1 -t²)) dt. Maybe this is a known integral. Let me look for references. Alternatively, consider expanding in a power series.

Let’s expand cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) as a Taylor series:

cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (sqrt(1 -t²))^{2k} / (2k)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (1 -t²)^k / (2k)! ).

Then, integrating term by term:

I = ∫₀¹ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (1 -t²)^k / (2k)! dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (2k)! ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^k dt.

As before, the integral ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^k dt = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2).

Using the duplication formula for Gamma functions: Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1}. But Γ(k +1) =k!.

So, ∫₀¹ (1 -t²)^k dt = (sqrt(π)/2) k! / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) ] = (sqrt(π)/2) * k! * 2^{k +1} / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π) ) ] = (2^{k} k! ) / (2k +1)!! ).

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...5*3*1 = (2k +1)! ) / (2^k k! ). Therefore, 2^{k} k! / (2k +1)!! ) = 2^{k} k! / [ (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ] = (2^{2k} (k! )² ) / (2k +1)! ).

Therefore, I = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (2k)! * (2^{2k} (k! )² ) / (2k +1)! ).

This simplifies to Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k 2^{2k} (k! )² / [ (2k)! (2k +1)! ) ].

This series might be related to a Bessel function or hypergeometric function. Let me recall that the Bessel function of the first kind has a series expansion:

J_n(z) = (z/2)^n Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (z/2)^{2k} / [k! (n +k)! ].

But our series is different. Alternatively, the hypergeometric function _pF_q. The hypergeometric function _1F_2(a; b, c; z) is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (a)_k z^k / [ (b)_k (c)_k k! ].

Our series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k 2^{2k} (k! )² / [ (2k)! (2k +1)! ) ].

Let me write this as Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k}) / (2k +1) ) ] * [ (k! )² / ( (2k)! )^2 ) ] * (2k)! / (2k)! ). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, note that (k! )² / (2k)! ) = 1 / binomial(2k, k). So the term becomes [ (-1)^k 4^k / (2k +1) ] / binomial(2k, k).

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, recognizing that this series might sum to a known constant. Let me compute the first few terms:

For k=0: (-1)^0 4^0 (0! )² / (0! 1! ) =1 *1 *1 / (1 *1 )=1.

For k=1: (-1)^1 4^1 (1! )² / (2! 3! ) = -4 *1 / (2 *6 )= -4/12 = -1/3.

For k=2: (-1)^2 4^2 (2! )² / (4! 5! ) =16 *4 / (24 *120 )=64 / 2880 = 4/180 = 1/45.

For k=3: (-1)^3 4^3 (3! )² / (6! 7! ) = -64 *36 / (720 *5040 )= -2304 / 3,628,800 ≈ -0.000635.

So the series is 1 -1/3 +1/45 -0.000635 + ... This seems to converge to approximately 0.666... but not sure. Let me compute the partial sums:

S0 =1

S1 =1 -1/3 ≈0.6667

S2 =0.6667 +1/45 ≈0.6667 +0.0222≈0.6889

S3≈0.6889 -0.000635≈0.6883

S4≈0.6883 + next term (k=4): (-1)^4 4^4 (4! )² / (8! 9! ) =256 *576 / (40320 *362880 )=147456 / 14,631,321,600 ≈0.00001008. So S4≈0.6883 +0.000010≈0.68831.

This seems to be converging to approximately 0.688... which is close to π/4 ≈0.785, but not exactly. Alternatively, it might be related to Bessel functions. Let me check J_0(2) or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be expressed in terms of the Fresnel integrals. Let me recall that:

C(z) = ∫₀^z cos( (π/2) t² ) dt.

But our integral is ∫₀¹ cos( sqrt(1 -t²) ) dt. Not directly related.

Alternatively, consider changing variables to s = sqrt(1 -t²). Then, t = sqrt(1 -s²), dt = -s / sqrt(1 -s²) ds. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ cos(s) * s / sqrt(1 -s²) ds. Which is the same as ∫₀¹ s cos(s) / sqrt(1 -s²) ds. Which is the same integral we had earlier. So again, no progress.

Given that all these methods are not yielding a closed-form solution, and the problem states to compute the integral analytically, I must have missed a substitution. Let me revisit the original integral:

Original integral: ∫₀² x^{-1/2} cos( [x(2 -x)]^{1/4} ) dx.

After substitution t = √x, we got 2 ∫₀^√2 cos( [t²(2 -t²)]^{1/4} ) dt.

Then, after several steps, we reduced it to 2√2 ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

Wait, perhaps this integral can be expressed in terms of the Bessel function. Let me recall that the integral ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du is related to the Bessel function J_0(a). Specifically, ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_0(a). Let me verify this.

The integral representation of J_0(a) is J_0(a) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Therefore, ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_0(a).

In our case, the integral is ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Let me differentiate the integral with respect to a:

d/da [ ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du ] = -∫₀¹ u sin(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

But our integral is ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Let me set a=1. Then, the integral is ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = - d/da [ ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du ] evaluated at a=1.

From the integral representation, ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_0(a). Therefore, the derivative with respect to a is (π/2) J_0’(a). But the derivative of J_0(a) is -J_1(a). Therefore,

d/da [ (π/2) J_0(a) ] = (π/2) (-J_1(a)).

Therefore, ∫₀¹ u sin(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_1(a).

But we have ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = - d/da [ (π/2) J_0(a) ] |_{a=1} = (π/2) J_1(1).

Wait, let me check:

We have:

d/da [ ∫₀¹ cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du ] = -∫₀¹ u sin(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) d/da J_0(a) = (π/2)(-J_1(a)).

Therefore, ∫₀¹ u sin(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_1(a).

But our integral is ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Let me integrate by parts. Let’s set v = u, dw = cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Then, dv = du, and w = ∫ cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_0(u) evaluated from 0 to1. Wait, no. The integral ∫ cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du is not straightforward. Alternatively, integrating by parts:

Let’s set v = sin(u), dw = u / sqrt(1 -u²) du. Then, dv = cos(u) du, and w = -sqrt(1 -u²). So:

∫ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = -sin(u) sqrt(1 -u²) |₀¹ + ∫ sqrt(1 -u²) cos(u) du.

Evaluate the first term: at u=1, sin(1) *0 =0; at u=0, 0*1=0. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) cos(u) du. But this is the same as J in our previous notation. Which we found to be J =1 + ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du. So this leads to:

∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du = ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 -u²) cos(u) du.

But this is the same as J =1 + ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du. Therefore, substituting:

∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du = J =1 + ∫₀¹ u cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du.

This implies 0=1, which is a contradiction. This suggests an error in the integration by parts. Let me check:

Let’s set v = u, dw = cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du. Then, dv = du, and w = ∫ cos(u)/sqrt(1 -u²) du. But this integral w is (π/2) J_0(u) as per the integral representation. Therefore, the integration by parts gives:

uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = u (π/2) J_0(u) |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (π/2) J_0(u) du.

At u=1: 1 * (π/2) J_0(1); at u=0:0 * (π/2) J_0(0) =0. So the first term is (π/2) J_0(1). The integral becomes:

(π/2) J_0(1) - (π/2) ∫₀¹ J_0(u) du.

But this doesn't seem helpful unless we can express ∫ J_0(u) du in terms of other functions. However, the integral of J_0(u) is known: ∫ J_0(u) du = π/2 [J_0(u) StruveH0(u) + J_1(u) StruveH-1(u) ] + C, which is complicated. Therefore, this approach might not yield a closed-form expression.

Given that all these methods are not working, and the problem states to compute the integral analytically, I must have missed a substitution. Let me go back to the original integral and consider another approach.

Original integral: ∫₀² x^{-1/2} cos( [x(2 -x)]^{1/4} ) dx.

Let me consider the substitution that was used earlier: t = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4}. Then, t^4 =x(2 -x). Let me solve for x: x² -2x +t^4 =0 => x=1 ± sqrt(1 -t^4). As before. Then, dx = ± ( -2t^3 / sqrt(1 -t^4) ) dt. But this leads to splitting the integral into two parts. However, when we did this before, we ended up with an integral involving Bessel functions. Given that the problem asks for an exact answer, perhaps the integral is expressed in terms of a Bessel function.

Given that after several steps, the integral reduces to 2√2 ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du, and this integral is related to Bessel functions, perhaps the final answer is expressed in terms of J_0(1) or J_1(1). However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the answer is in terms of Bessel functions, that would be acceptable as an exact answer.

From the previous steps, we have:

Original integral =2√2 ∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du.

But we also found that this integral is equal to (π/2) J_1(1). Therefore, the original integral =2√2 * (π/2) J_1(1) = √2 π J_1(1).

But let me verify this. Earlier, we had:

∫₀¹ u cos(u) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_1(1).

If that's the case, then the original integral is 2√2 * (π/2) J_1(1) = √2 π J_1(1).

But how to confirm this? Let me recall that the integral ∫₀¹ u cos(au) / sqrt(1 -u²) du = (π/2) J_1(a). Setting a=1, we get the integral equals (π/2) J_1(1). Therefore, the original integral is 2√2 * (π/2) J_1(1) = √2 π J_1(1).

Therefore, the exact answer is √2 π J_1(1), where J_1 is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.

However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If Bessel functions are considered elementary or acceptable, then this is the answer. Otherwise, perhaps there's a different substitution that leads to a closed-form expression in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of Fresnel integrals. Let me check the substitution again.

Alternatively, consider the original substitution t = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4}. Then, t^4 =x(2 -x). Let me parameterize x in terms of trigonometric functions. Let’s set x = 2 sin²θ. Then, 2 -x =2 cos²θ. So t^4 =2 sin²θ *2 cos²θ =4 sin²θ cos²θ = (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 = sin²(2θ). So t^4 = sin²(2θ) => t^2 = sin(2θ). Therefore, θ = (1/2) arcsin(t²). But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, set 2θ = φ, so t^2 = sinφ. Then, θ=φ/2. Then, x=2 sin²(φ/2) =2*(1 -cosφ)/2=1 -cosφ. So x=1 -cosφ. Then, dx = sinφ dφ. The integral becomes:

∫ x^{-1/2} cos(t) dx = ∫ (1 -cosφ)^{-1/2} cos(t) sinφ dφ.

But t = [x(2 -x)]^{1/4} = [ (1 -cosφ)(1 +cosφ) ]^{1/4} = (1 -cos²φ)^{1/4} = (sin²φ)^{1/4} = sin^{1/2}φ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 -cosφ)^{-1/2} cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) sinφ dφ.

But 1 -cosφ =2 sin²(φ/2), so (1 -cosφ)^{-1/2} =1/(√2 sin(φ/2)). So the integral becomes:

1/√2 ∫ [1/sin(φ/2)] cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) sinφ dφ.

Simplify sinφ =2 sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2). So:

1/√2 ∫ [1/sin(φ/2)] * cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) *2 sin(φ/2) cos(φ/2) dφ = √2 ∫ cos( sin^{1/2}φ ) cos(φ/2) dφ.

This is the same integral we had earlier, which didn't lead to a solution. Therefore, this path also doesn't help.

Given that all methods lead to Bessel functions or series expansions, and the problem requires an exact answer, I conclude that the exact answer is expressed in terms of a Bessel function. Therefore, the exact answer is √2 π J_1(1).

Now, to provide the numerical approximation. The Bessel function J_1(1) has a known value. From tables or calculators, J_1(1) ≈0.4400505857. Therefore, the numerical approximation is √2 * π *0.4400505857.

Compute this:

√2 ≈1.4142135624

π ≈3.1415926536

Multiply: 1.4142135624 *3.1415926536 ≈4.442882908

Then, 4.442882908 *0.4400505857 ≈1.955, but let me compute more accurately:

First, compute √2 * π:

1.41421356237 *3.14159265359 ≈4.442882908158366

Then multiply by J_1(1) ≈0.4400505857:

4.442882908158366 *0.4400505857 ≈

4 *0.4400505857 =1.7602023428

0.442882908158366 *0.4400505857 ≈0.442882908158366 *0.4 =0.1771531632633464

0.442882908158366 *0.0400505857 ≈0.017737
