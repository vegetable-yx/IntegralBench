Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is ∫₀² x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1) sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can find a substitution to simplify it.

First, the integrand has x^(-1/2) and (2 - x)^(-1). Maybe a substitution that combines x and 2 - x would help. Let me think about the term inside the sine function: the fourth root of x(2 - x). Let's denote t = x(2 - x). But maybe a substitution would be better if it simplifies the entire expression.

Wait, another approach: sometimes for integrals from 0 to a, especially with square roots, a trigonometric substitution might work. Let me try substituting x = 2 sin²θ. Then, 2 - x = 2 cos²θ. Let's see if that helps.

If x = 2 sin²θ, then dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's compute the limits. When x=0, sinθ=0 ⇒ θ=0. When x=2, sin²θ=1 ⇒ θ=π/2. So the new limits are from 0 to π/2.

Now, substitute into the integrand:

x^(-1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(-1/2) = (2)^(-1/2) (sinθ)^(-1)

(2 - x)^(-1) = (2 cos²θ)^(-1) = (2)^(-1) (cosθ)^(-2)

The argument of the sine function becomes ⁴√(x(2 - x)) = ⁴√(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = ⁴√(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (2 sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √(2 sinθ cosθ) = √(sin(2θ)) since sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Wait, sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so √(2 sinθ cosθ) = √(sin(2θ)) but that's not exactly a standard form. Maybe there's a better way to express that.

Wait, 4 sin²θ cos²θ = (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 = sin²(2θ). So ⁴√(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = ⁴√(sin²(2θ)) = sin^(1/2)(2θ). So the argument inside the sine function is sin^(1/2)(2θ). Therefore, the integrand's sine term is sin(sin^(1/2)(2θ)).

Putting it all together, the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to θ=π/2 of [ (2)^(-1/2) (sinθ)^(-1) ) * (2)^(-1) (cosθ)^(-2) ) * sin( sin^(1/2)(2θ) ) ] * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

Let me compute the constants and simplify the terms:

First, constants: 2^(-1/2) * 2^(-1) * 4 = 4 / (2^(3/2)) = 4 / (2 * √2) = 2 / √2 = √2.

Then, the sinθ terms: (sinθ)^(-1) * sinθ = 1^(-1 +1) = 1^0 = 1.

The cosθ terms: (cosθ)^(-2) * cosθ = cosθ^(-1) = secθ.

So the integral simplifies to √2 * ∫₀^(π/2) secθ * sin( sin^(1/2)(2θ) ) dθ.

Hmm, that doesn't look much simpler. Maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Original substitution:

x = 2 sin²θ, dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

x^(-1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(-1/2) = 2^(-1/2) sinθ^(-1)

(2 - x)^(-1) = (2 - 2 sin²θ)^(-1) = (2 cos²θ)^(-1) = 2^(-1) cosθ^(-2)

The argument inside the sine function: ⁴√(x(2 - x)) = ⁴√(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = ⁴√(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (2 sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √(2 sinθ cosθ) = √(sin(2θ)) because sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So √(2 sinθ cosθ) = √(sin(2θ)).

Therefore, the integrand becomes:

[2^(-1/2) sinθ^(-1)] * [2^(-1) cosθ^(-2)] * sin(√(sin(2θ))) * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

Multiply the constants: 2^(-1/2) * 2^(-1) *4 = 4/(2^(3/2)) = 4/(2*√2/2) Wait, 2^(3/2) is 2*sqrt(2), so 4/(2*sqrt(2)) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Then, the sinθ terms: sinθ^(-1) * sinθ = 1.

The cosθ terms: cosθ^(-2) * cosθ = cosθ^(-1) = secθ.

So the integral becomes sqrt(2) * ∫ secθ * sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ from 0 to π/2.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another substitution? Let's see. Let me set u = √(sin(2θ)). Then, u² = sin(2θ). Differentiating both sides: 2u du = 2 cos(2θ) dθ ⇒ u du = cos(2θ) dθ. But I don't see how that helps here. Alternatively, maybe another substitution inside the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution for the entire expression. Let me think. The integral is sqrt(2) ∫ secθ sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ from 0 to π/2. Let me try to express sin(2θ) in terms of another variable. Let me set t = √(sin(2θ)). Then, t² = sin(2θ). Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = 2 cos(2θ) dθ ⇒ t dt = cos(2θ) dθ. But how does that relate to the current variables? Hmm, not sure. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of φ = 2θ. Then, θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes sqrt(2)/2 ∫ sec(φ/2) sin(√(sinφ)) dφ from φ=0 to φ=π. But sec(φ/2) is 1/cos(φ/2), which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me think again. The integrand after substitution is sqrt(2) * sin(√(sin(2θ))) * secθ dθ. Let's write secθ as 1/cosθ. So sqrt(2) ∫ [sin(√(sin(2θ)))] / cosθ dθ. Maybe express sin(2θ) as 2 sinθ cosθ. So √(sin(2θ)) = √(2 sinθ cosθ). Then, the integrand becomes sqrt(2) * sin(√(2 sinθ cosθ)) / cosθ dθ. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another substitution. Let me set t = sinθ. Then, dt = cosθ dθ. But in the current integral, we have 1/cosθ dθ. So if t = sinθ, then dθ = dt / cosθ, but cosθ = sqrt(1 - t²). So 1/cosθ dθ = dt / (1 - t²). Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution for the entire expression inside the sine. Let me set u = √(sin(2θ)). Then, as before, u² = sin(2θ). Let's see. Then, du/dθ = (1/(2u)) * 2 cos(2θ) = cos(2θ)/u. So du = cos(2θ)/u dθ. Hmm, not directly helpful. But maybe express cos(2θ) in terms of u. Since sin(2θ) = u², then cos(2θ) = sqrt(1 - u^4). Wait, but 2θ is between 0 and π, so 2θ from 0 to π, so cos(2θ) goes from 1 to -1. So cos(2θ) = sqrt(1 - u^4) when 0 ≤ 2θ ≤ π/2, and -sqrt(1 - u^4) when π/2 ≤ 2θ ≤ π. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/4 and π/4 to π/2. But this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding the sine function into its Taylor series. Since sin(z) = Σ [(-1)^n z^(2n+1)] / (2n+1)! for n=0 to ∞. Then, sin(√(sin(2θ))) = Σ [(-1)^n (sin(2θ))^(n + 1/2)] / (2n+1)!.

But integrating term by term might be possible. Let's try that.

So, the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ Σ [(-1)^n (sin(2θ))^(n + 1/2) / (2n+1)! ] dθ.

Interchange the sum and integral (if valid):

sqrt(2) Σ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1)! ] ∫₀^(π/2) secθ (sin(2θ))^(n + 1/2) dθ.

Hmm, but integrating secθ (sin(2θ))^(n + 1/2) dθ from 0 to π/2. Let's see. Let me express sin(2θ) as 2 sinθ cosθ. So (sin(2θ))^(n + 1/2) = (2 sinθ cosθ)^(n + 1/2) = 2^(n + 1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(n + 1/2). Then, secθ = 1/cosθ. So the integrand becomes 2^(n + 1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(n + 1/2) / cosθ = 2^(n + 1/2) sin^(n + 1/2)θ cos^(n + 1/2 -1)θ = 2^(n + 1/2) sin^(n + 1/2)θ cos^(n - 1/2)θ.

So the integral becomes 2^(n + 1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(n + 1/2)θ cos^(n - 1/2)θ dθ.

This looks like a Beta function integral. Recall that ∫₀^(π/2) sin^aθ cos^bθ dθ = (1/2) B((a+1)/2, (b+1)/2) where B is the Beta function, and B(x,y) = Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y).

So here, a = n + 1/2, b = n - 1/2. Then,

Integral = 2^(n + 1/2) * (1/2) B( (n + 1/2 +1)/2, (n - 1/2 +1)/2 )

Simplify the arguments:

For the Beta function:

First argument: (n + 3/2)/2 = (2n +3)/4

Second argument: (n + 1/2)/2 = (2n +1)/4

So B( (2n +3)/4, (2n +1)/4 ) = Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ( (4n +4)/4 ) = Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 )

But Γ(n +1 ) = n!.

Also, using the reflection formula or properties of Gamma functions, Γ(z)Γ(1 - z) = π / sin(π z). But not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, note that (2n +3)/4 + (2n +1)/4 = (4n +4)/4 = n +1, which matches the denominator.

But I'm not sure how to simplify this Beta function further. However, perhaps using duplication formula or other properties.

Alternatively, express in terms of Gamma functions:

So the integral becomes 2^(n + 1/2) * (1/2) * [ Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ) ]

So the entire term in the sum is:

sqrt(2) * [ (-1)^n / (2n +1)! ] * 2^(n + 1/2) * (1/2) * [ Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ) ]

Simplify constants:

sqrt(2) * 2^(n + 1/2) * 1/2 = sqrt(2) * 2^(n) * sqrt(2) * 1/2 = 2^(n) * (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 ) = 2^n * (2/2) = 2^n.

So the term simplifies to:

2^n * [ (-1)^n / (2n +1)! ] * [ Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ) ]

Therefore, the integral is Σ [ (-1)^n 2^n / (2n +1)! ] * [ Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ) ] for n=0 to ∞.

Hmm, this seems quite complicated. I wonder if this series can be simplified or related to a known function. Alternatively, maybe there's a better substitution that I missed.

Let me go back to the original integral. Maybe another substitution. Let's consider the substitution t = sqrt(x). Let t = x^(1/2), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then, when x=0, t=0; x=2, t=√2.

The integral becomes ∫₀^√2 (t²)^(-1/2) (2 - t²)^(-1) sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) * 2t dt.

Simplify:

(t²)^(-1/2) = t^(-1), so the integrand becomes:

t^(-1) * (2 - t²)^(-1) * sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) * 2t dt = 2 * (2 - t²)^(-1) * sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) dt.

So the integral is 2 ∫₀^√2 [1/(2 - t²)] sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) dt.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t². Then, du = 2t dt, but t = sqrt(u), so dt = du/(2 sqrt(u)). But this might not help. Alternatively, set u = t²(2 - t²). Then, du/dt = 2t(2 - t²) + t²(-2t) = 4t - 2t³ - 2t³ = 4t -4t³. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution to make the argument of the sine function simpler. Let me set z = ⁴√(x(2 - x)). Then, z^4 = x(2 - x). Let's see if this substitution can be useful. Then, solving for x: z^4 = 2x - x² ⇒ x² - 2x + z^4 = 0 ⇒ x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4z^4)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - z^4). But this might complicate the expression. Also, differentiating z in terms of x: dz/dx = (1/4)(x(2 - x))^(-3/4)(2 - 2x). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider symmetry. The original integral is from 0 to 2. Let me check if the integrand is symmetric around x=1. Let x = 2 - y. When x=0, y=2; x=2, y=0. So substitution x = 2 - y, dx = -dy. The integral becomes ∫₂^0 (2 - y)^(-1/2) y^(-1) sin(⁴√((2 - y)y)) (-dy) = ∫₀² y^(-1) (2 - y)^(-1/2) sin(⁴√(y(2 - y))) dy. Comparing to the original integral, which is ∫₀² x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1) sin(...) dx. So the integrand is not symmetric in x and y, but the substitution swaps the terms. So unless the integrand is symmetric, which it's not, this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the substitution u = x/(2 - x). Let me try that. Let u = x/(2 - x). Then, x = 2u/(1 + u), and 2 - x = 2 - 2u/(1 + u) = 2(1 - u/(1 + u)) = 2/(1 + u). Then, dx = [2(1 + u) - 2u]/(1 + u)^2 du = 2/(1 + u)^2 du.

Substituting into the integral:

x^(-1/2) = [2u/(1 + u)]^(-1/2) = (2u)^(-1/2) (1 + u)^(1/2)

(2 - x)^(-1) = [2/(1 + u)]^(-1) = (1 + u)/2

The argument: ⁴√(x(2 - x)) = ⁴√( [2u/(1 + u)] * [2/(1 + u)] ) = ⁴√(4u/(1 + u)^2) = (4u)^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2) = (2^(2) u)^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2) = 2^(1/2) u^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2)

So the integrand becomes:

(2u)^(-1/2) (1 + u)^(1/2) * (1 + u)/2 * sin(2^(1/2) u^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2)) * 2/(1 + u)^2 du

Simplify term by term:

(2u)^(-1/2) = 2^(-1/2) u^(-1/2)

(1 + u)^(1/2) * (1 + u)/2 = (1 + u)^(3/2)/2

Multiply by 2/(1 + u)^2: 2/(1 + u)^2 * (1 + u)^(3/2)/2 = (1 + u)^(-1/2)

So combining all terms:

2^(-1/2) u^(-1/2) * (1 + u)^(-1/2) * sin(2^(1/2) u^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2)) du

So the integral becomes:

2^(-1/2) ∫ [u^(-1/2) (1 + u)^(-1/2)] sin(2^(1/2) u^(1/4)/(1 + u)^(1/2)) du from u=0 to u=∞ (since when x approaches 2, u approaches infinity).

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. The limits are now from 0 to infinity, which might not be helpful. Maybe this substitution isn't the way to go.

Let me think again. The original integral after substitution led to sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ. Maybe there's a way to express this in terms of a known integral or a special function. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution inside this integral.

Let me try substituting φ = 2θ. Then, θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀^π [1/cos(φ/2)] sin(√(sinφ)) dφ. But this still doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps split the integral into two parts. Let me consider the substitution t = π/2 - θ. When θ = 0, t = π/2; θ = π/2, t =0. Then, the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) sec(π/2 - t) sin(√(sin(2(π/2 - t)))) (-dt). But sec(π/2 - t) = csc t. And sin(2(π/2 - t)) = sin(π - 2t) = sin(2t). So the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) csc t sin(√(sin(2t))) dt. But this is the same as the original integral, so symmetry doesn't help here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider numerical integration. But the problem asks for an analytical solution first. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a trick I'm missing. Let me think again about the original integral:

∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) dx.

Let me consider the substitution t = ⁴√(x(2 - x)). Let's set t = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Then, t^4 = x(2 - x). Let's try to express x in terms of t. Then, x(2 - x) = t^4 ⇒ -x² + 2x = t^4 ⇒ x² - 2x + t^4 =0 ⇒ x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4t^4)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - t^4). But since x is between 0 and 2, both solutions are possible. However, depending on t, sqrt(1 - t^4) must be real, so t^4 ≤1 ⇒ t ≤1. So, when t varies from 0 to 1, x varies from 0 to 1 and back to 0. Wait, but the original x goes from 0 to 2. So this substitution might not be injective. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, differentiate t with respect to x:

dt/dx = (1/4)[x(2 - x)]^{-3/4}(2 - 2x) = (1/4)(2 - 2x)/[x(2 - x)]^{3/4}

But this seems complicated. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, consider the substitution z = sqrt(x). Then, x = z², dx = 2z dz. The integral becomes ∫₀^√2 z^{-1} (2 - z²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(z²(2 - z²))) * 2z dz = 2 ∫₀^√2 (2 - z²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(z²(2 - z²))) dz. Which is similar to what I had before. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe another substitution. Let me consider u = x/2. Then, x = 2u, dx = 2 du, limits from 0 to1. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ (2u)^{-1/2} (2 - 2u)^{-1} sin(⁴√(2u(2 - 2u))) * 2 du.

Simplify:

(2u)^{-1/2} = 2^{-1/2} u^{-1/2}

(2 - 2u)^{-1} = (2(1 - u))^{-1} = 2^{-1} (1 - u)^{-1}

So the integrand becomes 2^{-1/2} u^{-1/2} * 2^{-1} (1 - u)^{-1} * sin(⁴√(4u(1 - u))) * 2 du.

Wait, the argument inside the sine is ⁴√(2u * 2(1 - u)) = ⁴√(4u(1 - u)) = (4u(1 - u))^{1/4} = (4)^{1/4} (u(1 - u))^{1/4} = sqrt(2) (u(1 - u))^{1/4}.

So the integrand becomes:

2^{-1/2} * 2^{-1} * 2 * sin(sqrt(2) (u(1 - u))^{1/4}) * u^{-1/2} (1 - u)^{-1} du

Simplify constants: 2^{-1/2 -1 +1} = 2^{-1/2} = 1/√2.

So the integral is (1/√2) ∫₀¹ u^{-1/2} (1 - u)^{-1} sin(sqrt(2) (u(1 - u))^{1/4}) du.

Hmm, still complicated. The (1 - u)^{-1} term suggests a possible divergence at u=1, but the original integral at x=2, which corresponds to u=1, has (2 - x)^{-1} which is (2 - 2u)^{-1} = 2^{-1}(1 - u)^{-1}, so yes, there's a singularity at u=1. But the original integral's integrand at x approaching 2 behaves like (2 - x)^{-1} times other terms. Let's check if the integral converges. Near x=2, x^{-1/2} is finite, (2 - x)^{-1} is integrable if the power is less than 1. Since (2 - x)^{-1} is not integrable over [0,2], but wait, the original integral is from 0 to 2. Wait, at x=0, x^{-1/2} is integrable (since the integral of x^{-1/2} converges near 0). At x=2, (2 - x)^{-1} is not integrable. So the integral might diverge? But the problem states to compute the definite integral, so perhaps it's an improper integral that converges.

Wait, let's check the behavior near x=2. As x approaches 2, the integrand behaves like (2 - x)^{-1} times other terms. The other terms: x^{-1/2} ~ (2)^{-1/2}, and sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) ~ sin(⁴√(2*(2 - x))) ~ sin( (2)^{1/4} (2 - x)^{1/4} ). As x→2, (2 - x)^{1/4} →0, so sin(...) ~ (2)^{1/4} (2 - x)^{1/4}. Therefore, near x=2, the integrand behaves like (2 - x)^{-1} * (2 - x)^{1/4} = (2 - x)^{-3/4}, which is integrable since the exponent -3/4 is greater than -1. So the integral converges.

Similarly, near x=0, x^{-1/2} is integrable. So the integral is convergent.

But back to the problem. I'm stuck trying to find an analytical solution. Maybe there's a substitution that I haven't thought of yet. Let me think again about the original integral:

∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) dx.

Let me consider the substitution t = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then, t² = x(2 - x). Let's see if this helps. Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = (2 - 2x) dx. So dx = (2t dt)/(2 - 2x). But x(2 - x) = t² ⇒ 2x - x² = t² ⇒ x² - 2x + t² =0 ⇒ x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4t²)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - t²). So x = 1 ± sqrt(1 - t²). But since x is between 0 and 2, both solutions are possible. However, t ranges from 0 to sqrt(1) =1, since maximum of x(2 - x) is 1 (at x=1). So t ranges from 0 to1.

But this substitution might not be injective. For each t in (0,1), there are two x values: 1 =1 + sqrt(1 - t²) and x2 =1 - sqrt(1 - t²). But x1 is from 1 to 2, and x2 is from 0 to1. So, splitting the integral into two parts: from 0 to1 and1 to2.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to proceed.

For x in [0,1], x =1 - sqrt(1 - t²), and for x in [1,2], x =1 + sqrt(1 - t²). So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ [x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(t^{1/2}) * dx/dt dt ] from t=0 to t=1 for both parts.

But this seems very involved. Let's compute dx/dt for x =1 - sqrt(1 - t²):

dx/dt = (1/2)(1 - t²)^{-1/2} * 2t = t / sqrt(1 - t²)

Similarly, for x =1 + sqrt(1 - t²), dx/dt = -t / sqrt(1 - t²)

But since we're splitting the integral, the total integral would be:

∫₀¹ [ (1 - sqrt(1 - t²))^{-1/2} (2 - (1 - sqrt(1 - t²)))^{-1} sin(t^{1/2}) * t / sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt

plus

∫₀¹ [ (1 + sqrt(1 - t²))^{-1/2} (2 - (1 + sqrt(1 - t²)))^{-1} sin(t^{1/2}) * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) ] dt

But the second integral has negative dx/dt, so we take absolute value. However, since we're integrating from t=1 to t=0 for the upper part, but since we split the integral, it's better to handle each part separately. This seems too complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck trying to find an analytical solution. Maybe the integral is related to a known integral or a special function. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that simplifies the integral to a standard form.

Wait, going back to the substitution x = 2 sin²θ. The integral became sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ. Let me consider substituting φ = sin(2θ). Let φ = sin(2θ), then when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=0. Wait, no, when θ=π/4, φ=sin(π/2)=1, and θ=π/2, φ=sin(π)=0. So the substitution φ = sin(2θ) would go from 0 to1 and back to0. Not injective. Alternatively, split the integral at θ=π/4.

Let me split the integral into θ from0 to π/4 and π/4 to π/2.

For θ in [0, π/4], 2θ in [0, π/2], so φ = sin(2θ) goes from0 to1. Let φ = sin(2θ), then dφ = 2 cos(2θ) dθ. So dθ = dφ/(2 cos(2θ)). But cos(2θ) = sqrt(1 - φ²). So for the first part:

Integral from0 to π/4 becomes:

sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ secθ sin(√φ) * dφ/(2 sqrt(1 - φ²))

But θ is related to φ by φ = sin(2θ). So θ = (1/2) arcsinφ. So secθ = 1/cos( (1/2) arcsinφ ). This seems complicated.

Similarly, for the second part, θ in [π/4, π/2], 2θ in [π/2, π], so φ = sin(2θ) decreases from1 to0. Let φ = sin(2θ), then dφ = 2 cos(2θ) dθ. But cos(2θ) = -sqrt(1 - φ²) here. So dθ = dφ/(2 cos(2θ)) = -dφ/(2 sqrt(1 - φ²)). So the integral from π/4 to π/2 becomes:

sqrt(2) ∫₁⁰ secθ sin(√φ) * (-dφ)/(2 sqrt(1 - φ²)) = sqrt(2) ∫₀¹ secθ sin(√φ) * dφ/(2 sqrt(1 - φ²))

But θ here is (1/2)(π - arcsinφ). So secθ = 1/cos( (π - arcsinφ)/2 ). Using trigonometric identities, cos( (π - arcsinφ)/2 ) = sin( (arcsinφ)/2 ). Because cos( (π - a)/2 ) = sin(a/2). So secθ = 1/sin( (arcsinφ)/2 ). This seems very complicated.

Combining both parts, the total integral becomes:

sqrt(2)/2 ∫₀¹ [ sec( (1/2) arcsinφ ) + sec( (π - arcsinφ)/2 ) ] sin(√φ) / sqrt(1 - φ²) dφ

But this seems too complex to evaluate analytically. I'm not sure if this can be simplified further.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of a Fresnel integral or another special function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that I'm missing.

Wait, let's consider the original integral again. The integrand is x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))). Let me make a substitution to simplify the radicals. Let me set t = x^{1/2}, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then, the integral becomes:

∫₀^√2 t^{-1} (2 - t²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀^√2 (2 - t²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) dt.

Now, let me set u = t². Then, t = sqrt(u), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du. The integral becomes:

2 ∫₀² (2 - u)^{-1} sin(⁴√(u(2 - u))) * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du = ∫₀² (2 - u)^{-1} u^{-1/2} sin(⁴√(u(2 - u))) du.

Wait, but this is the same as the original integral! So this substitution just swaps x and u, which doesn't help. Hence, this approach isn't useful.

At this point, I'm starting to think that maybe the integral doesn't have an elementary antiderivative and requires special functions or a series expansion. Given that the problem asks for an analytical solution, perhaps there's a clever substitution or transformation that I'm missing.

Alternatively, maybe the integral can be expressed in terms of the Fresnel integral. The Fresnel integrals involve sin(x²) or cos(x²), but here we have a sine of a fourth root. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider a substitution where the argument of the sine function becomes a new variable. Let me set z = ⁴√(x(2 - x)). Then, z^4 = x(2 - x). Differentiating both sides: 4z^3 dz = (2 - 2x) dx. So dx = (4z^3 dz)/(2 - 2x). But x(2 - x) = z^4 ⇒ x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4z^4)]/2 =1 ± sqrt(1 - z^4). So 2 - 2x = 2 - 2[1 ± sqrt(1 - z^4)] = 2 - 2 ∓ 2 sqrt(1 - z^4) = ± 2 sqrt(1 - z^4). Depending on the branch. For x in [0,1], we take the negative sign: x =1 - sqrt(1 - z^4), so 2 - 2x = 2 sqrt(1 - z^4). For x in [1,2], take the positive sign: x=1 + sqrt(1 - z^4), so 2 - 2x = -2 sqrt(1 - z^4). But this complicates the expression.

Assuming we take x in [0,1], then dx = (4z^3 dz)/(2 sqrt(1 - z^4)) = (2z^3)/sqrt(1 - z^4) dz.

So the integral for x in [0,1] becomes:

∫ [x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(z) ] * (2z^3)/sqrt(1 - z^4) dz.

But x =1 - sqrt(1 - z^4), so x^{-1/2} = [1 - sqrt(1 - z^4)]^{-1/2}

(2 - x)^{-1} = [2 - (1 - sqrt(1 - z^4))]^{-1} = [1 + sqrt(1 - z^4)]^{-1}

So the integrand becomes:

[1 - sqrt(1 - z^4)]^{-1/2} [1 + sqrt(1 - z^4)]^{-1} * sin(z) * 2z^3 / sqrt(1 - z^4) dz

This seems very complicated. Similarly, for x in [1,2], the expression would be similar but with different signs. This approach doesn't seem to lead to a simplification.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution through substitution or series expansion, I might need to consider that the integral is designed to have a trick that I'm missing. Let me think again about the original integral:

∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) dx.

Let me consider the substitution y = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then, y² = x(2 - x). Differentiating both sides: 2y dy = (2 - 2x) dx ⇒ y dy = (1 - x) dx. But x is expressed in terms of y: x =1 ± sqrt(1 - y²). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that combines x and 2 - x. Let me set t = x/(2 - x). Then, x = 2t/(1 + t), 2 - x = 2/(1 + t), dx = 2/(1 + t)^2 dt. The integral becomes:

∫₀^∞ [ (2t/(1 + t))^{-1/2} * (2/(1 + t))^{-1} * sin(⁴√( (2t/(1 + t))(2/(1 + t)) )) * 2/(1 + t)^2 ] dt.

Simplify:

(2t/(1 + t))^{-1/2} = (2t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}

(2/(1 + t))^{-1} = (1 + t)/2

The argument inside the sine: ⁴√(4t/(1 + t)^2) = (4t)^{1/4}/(1 + t)^{1/2} = (2^{2} t)^{1/4}/(1 + t)^{1/2} = 2^{1/2} t^{1/4}/(1 + t)^{1/2}

So the integrand becomes:

(2^{-1/2} t^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2}) * ( (1 + t)/2 ) * sin(2^{1/2} t^{1/4}/(1 + t)^{1/2}) * 2/(1 + t)^2 dt

Simplify constants and terms:

2^{-1/2} * 1/2 * 2 = 2^{-1/2} *1 = 1/√2

t^{-1/2} * t^{1/4} = t^{-1/4}

(1 + t)^{1/2} * (1 + t) * (1 + t)^{-2} = (1 + t)^{-1/2}

So the integrand becomes (1/√2) t^{-1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2} sin(2^{1/2} t^{1/4}/(1 + t)^{1/2}) dt

This still looks complicated, but maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t^{1/4}. Then, t = u^4, dt = 4u^3 du. The integral becomes:

(1/√2) ∫₀^∞ (u^{-1}) (1 + u^4)^{-1/2} sin(2^{1/2} u / (1 + u^4)^{1/2}) *4u^3 du

Simplify:

4/√2 ∫₀^∞ u^2 (1 + u^4)^{-1/2} sin(2^{1/2} u / (1 + u^4)^{1/2}) du

Simplify 4/√2 = 2√2.

So the integral is 2√2 ∫₀^∞ [u^2 / sqrt(1 + u^4)] sin( sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4) ) du.

Hmm, this still doesn't ring a bell. Maybe another substitution. Let me set v = sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4). Then, v = sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4). Let's try to express u in terms of v. This seems complicated. Alternatively, consider differentiating v. Let v = sqrt(2) u (1 + u^4)^{-1/2}. Then, dv/du = sqrt(2) [ (1 + u^4)^{-1/2} + u*(-1/2)(1 + u^4)^{-3/2}*4u^3 ] = sqrt(2) [ (1 + u^4)^{-1/2} - 2u^4 (1 + u^4)^{-3/2} ] = sqrt(2) (1 + u^4 - 2u^4) / (1 + u^4)^{3/2} } = sqrt(2) (1 - u^4) / (1 + u^4)^{3/2}

Not sure if this helps. The integral now is 2√2 ∫ [u^2 / sqrt(1 + u^4)] sin(v) du. If I could express u^2 / sqrt(1 + u^4) in terms of v and dv, but it seems complicated.

At this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe the integral is designed to be recognized as a particular form. Let me think about the original integrand again: x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))). Maybe there's a substitution that makes the argument of the sine function linear. For example, if the argument was t, then dt would be related to the other terms. But I don't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral by parts. Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))), dv = x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} dx. Then, du = cos(⁴√(x(2 - x))) * (1/4)(x(2 - x))^{-3/4} (2 - 2x) dx. This seems even more complicated. Not helpful.

Alternatively, take dv = x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} dx, and u = sin(...). But finding v would require integrating x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} dx, which is ∫ dx / [x^{1/2} (2 - x)]. Let me compute this integral.

Let me compute v = ∫ x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} dx. Let me set t = sqrt(x). Then, x = t², dx = 2t dt. So v = ∫ (t^{-1} (2 - t²)^{-1}) * 2t dt = 2 ∫ (2 - t²)^{-1} dt. This is 2 ∫ 1/(2 - t²) dt = 2 * (1/(2 sqrt(2))) ln | (sqrt(2) + t)/(sqrt(2) - t) | ) + C. So v = (1/√2) ln( (sqrt(2) + t)/(sqrt(2) - t) ) + C. Substituting back t = sqrt(x), v = (1/√2) ln( (sqrt(2) + sqrt(x))/(sqrt(2) - sqrt(x)) ) + C.

But integrating by parts with u = sin(⁴√(x...)) and dv = x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} dx would lead to v as above and du as a complicated expression. This doesn't seem to help.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution through substitution or other methods, I might need to consider that the integral is designed to be transformed into a known integral or that the integrand is an exact derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to a simple expression despite its complicated appearance.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = sqrt(x(2 - x). Let t = sqrt(x(2 - x)), then t² = x(2 - x). Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = (2 - 2x) dx. So dx = (2t dt)/(2 - 2x). But x(2 - x) = t² ⇒ x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4t²)]/2 =1 ± sqrt(1 - t²). So 2 - 2x = ±2 sqrt(1 - t²). For x in [0,1], we take the negative sign: 2 - 2x = 2 sqrt(1 - t²). For x in [1,2], positive sign: 2 - 2x = -2 sqrt(1 - t²). But this leads to the same complications as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is zero. But the integrand is positive in (0,2) except for the sine term. The sine term could oscillate, but the integral might not be zero. Alternatively, maybe the integral evaluates to π or something similar. But I need to check.

Alternatively, consider numerical integration to get an approximate value, which is part of the problem's requirement. Let's compute the numerical approximation.

The original integral is ∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))) dx.

This integral can be evaluated numerically using methods like adaptive quadrature. Let's approximate it numerically.

First, note that the integrand has singularities at x=0 and x=2, but they are integrable. Let's use numerical integration techniques. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll need to use a calculator or approximate it using known methods.

Alternatively, use substitution to make it more manageable. Let's use the substitution x = 2 sin²θ as before, which transforms the integral to sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ. This integral can be numerically evaluated.

Alternatively, use numerical approximation tools. Let's approximate the original integral numerically.

Using a computational tool like Mathematica or an online integral calculator, the integral can be evaluated numerically. However, since I don't have access to such tools right now, I'll have to estimate it manually.

Alternatively, consider expanding the sine function in a Taylor series and integrating term by term.

Let me try that. The integrand is x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(⁴√(x(2 - x))). Let me set z = ⁴√(x(2 - x)) = [x(2 - x)]^{1/4}. Then, sin(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1)!.

So the integrand becomes x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n [x(2 - x)]^{(2n+1)/4} / (2n+1)!.

Interchange sum and integral (assuming convergence):

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1)! ] ∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2n+1)/4 (2 - x)^{-1 + (2n+1)/4} dx.

Simplify the exponents:

For x: exponent is -1/2 + (2n+1)/4 = (-2 + 2n +1)/4 = (2n -1)/4.

For (2 - x): exponent is -1 + (2n+1)/4 = (-4 + 2n +1)/4 = (2n -3)/4.

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1)! ] ∫₀² x^{(2n -1)/4} (2 - x)^{(2n -3)/4} dx.

This integral is a Beta function. Let me make the substitution t = x/2, so x = 2t, dx = 2dt, limits from0 to1.

The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (2t)^{(2n -1)/4} (2(1 - t))^{(2n -3)/4} * 2 dt = 2^{(2n -1)/4 + (2n -3)/4 +1} ∫₀¹ t^{(2n -1)/4} (1 - t)^{(2n -3)/4} dt.

Simplify the exponent of 2:

(2n -1)/4 + (2n -3)/4 +1 = (4n -4)/4 +1 = (n -1) +1 = n.

So 2^n.

The integral is 2^n ∫₀¹ t^{(2n -1)/4} (1 - t)^{(2n -3)/4} dt.

This is 2^n B( (2n +3)/4, (2n +1)/4 ), where B is the Beta function.

But B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).

So the integral becomes 2^n Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ( (4n +4)/4 ) = 2^n Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ).

Therefore, the original series is:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (2n+1)! ] * 2^n Γ( (2n +3)/4 ) Γ( (2n +1)/4 ) / Γ(n +1 ).

This series might converge, but it's not obvious how to sum it. However, perhaps for specific values of n, the Gamma functions can be simplified.

Let me compute the first few terms to approximate the integral numerically.

For n=0:

Term = [ (-1)^0 / 1! ] * 2^0 Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) / Γ(1) = 1 * 1 * Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4) /1.

But Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (√2/2) ) = π * 2/√2 = π√2.

So term = π√2.

For n=1:

[ (-1)^1 / 3! ] * 2^1 Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) / Γ(2).

Γ(5/4) = (1/4)Γ(1/4), Γ(3/4) is known, Γ(2)=1.

So term = (-1/6) * 2 * (1/4)Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = (-1/12) * Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4).

But Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π√2.

So term = (-1/12) * π√2 ≈ -0.2617993878.

For n=2:

[ (-1)^2 / 5! ] * 2^2 Γ(7/4) Γ(5/4) / Γ(3).

Γ(7/4) = (3/4)Γ(3/4), Γ(5/4) = (1/4)Γ(1/4), Γ(3)=2! =2.

So term = (1/120) *4 * (3/4 Γ(3/4)) * (1/4 Γ(1/4)) /2 = (1/120) *4 * (3/16) Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4) /2.

Simplify:

4 *3/(16*2) = 12/(32) = 3/8.

So term = (1/120) * 3/8 * π√2 = (3/960) π√2 ≈ (1/320) π√2 ≈ 0.0139626335.

For n=3:

[ (-1)^3 /7! ] *2^3 Γ(9/4)Γ(7/4)/Γ(4).

Γ(9/4) = (5/4)(5/4 -1)Γ(5/4 -1) = (5/4)(1/4)Γ(1/4) = (5/16)Γ(1/4).

Γ(7/4) = (3/4)Γ(3/4).

Γ(4)=6.

So term = (-1/5040) *8 * (5/16 Γ(1/4))*(3/4 Γ(3/4)) /6.

Simplify:

8 *5/16 *3/4 /6 = (8*5*3)/(16*4*6) = 120/384 = 5/16.

So term = (-1/5040) *5/16 * Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = (-5/(5040*16)) * π√2 ≈ (-5/80640) π√2 ≈ -0.000272106.

Adding these terms:

n=0: π√2 ≈ 4.442882908

n=1: -0.2617993878

n=2: +0.0139626335

n=3: -0.000272106

Total approximation: 4.442882908 -0.2617993878 = 4.18108352 +0.0139626335=4.19504615 -0.000272106≈4.19477404.

Higher terms will contribute smaller amounts. For example, n=4:

Term = [1/9! ] *2^4 Γ(11/4)Γ(9/4)/Γ(5).

But this will be very small. Let's estimate:

Γ(11/4) = (7/4)(7/4 -1)(7/4 -2)Γ(7/4 -3) = ... This is getting too tedious. The term will be positive and very small, so the total approximation is around 4.19477.

But this is a rough approximation. However, comparing to a numerical integration, the actual value might be around 4.19477. But I need to check.

Alternatively, using numerical integration, the integral evaluates to approximately 4.442882908 -0.2617993878 +0.0139626335 -0.000272106 ≈ 4.19477. But this is just the sum of the first few terms. However, the first term (n=0) is π√2 ≈4.4429, which is already larger than the subsequent terms. This suggests that the series might converge to a value around 4.44, but the subsequent terms are negative and positive, possibly leading to a lower value.

But this is just a rough approximation. To get an accurate numerical value, I would need to compute more terms or use a numerical method. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the numerical approximation.

Alternatively, considering the first term is π√2 ≈4.4429, and the next term subtracts about 0.2618, giving around 4.1811, then adding 0.01396 gives 4.1950, then subtracting 0.00027 gives 4.1947. The terms are getting smaller, so the sum converges to around 4.1947. However, this might not be accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is π. Let's check: π ≈3.1416, which is less than our approximation. Not matching. Or 2π≈6.2832, too big. Or π²≈9.8696, no. Alternatively, sqrt(2)π≈4.4429, which matches the first term. But the total sum is less than that. So maybe the exact value is sqrt(2)π/2 ≈2.2214, but our approximation is higher. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π. But our approximation is around 4.1947, which is larger than π. So this is unlikely.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution and the numerical approximation is around 4.19477, but this is based on only a few terms of the series, which might be inaccurate. Therefore, I need to find a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, consider using the substitution that transforms the integral into a standard form. Let me think again about the substitution x = 2 sin²θ. The integral became sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ sin(√(sin(2θ))) dθ. Let me consider expanding sin(√(sin(2θ))) in a Taylor series.

Let z = √(sin(2θ)). Then, sin(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k+1}/(2k+1)!.

So the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^(π/2) secθ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k [sin(2θ)]^{k + 1/2}/(2k+1)! dθ.

Interchange sum and integral:

sqrt(2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k/(2k+1)! ∫₀^(π/2) secθ [sin(2θ)]^{k + 1/2} dθ.

Let me compute the integral: ∫₀^(π/2) secθ [sin(2θ)]^{k + 1/2} dθ.

Express sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So [sin(2θ)]^{k + 1/2} = 2^{k + 1/2} (sinθ cosθ)^{k + 1/2}.

So the integral becomes 2^{k + 1/2} ∫₀^(π/2) secθ (sinθ cosθ)^{k + 1/2} dθ.

But secθ = 1/cosθ, so:

2^{k + 1/2} ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^{k + 1/2} (cosθ)^{k + 1/2 -1} dθ = 2^{k + 1/2} ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^{k + 1/2} (cosθ)^{k - 1/2} dθ.

This is a Beta function integral. Recall that ∫₀^(π/2) sin^aθ cos^bθ dθ = (1/2) B((a+1)/2, (b+1)/2).

Here, a = k + 1/2, b = k - 1/2.

So the integral becomes 2^{k + 1/2} * (1/2) B( (k + 1/2 +1)/2, (k - 1/2 +1)/2 ) = 2^{k - 1/2} B( (k + 3/2)/2, (k + 1/2)/2 ).

Simplify the arguments:

(k + 3/2)/2 = (2k +3)/4

(k + 1/2)/2 = (2k +1)/4

So B( (2k +3)/4, (2k +1)/4 ) = Γ((2k +3)/4)Γ((2k +1)/4)/Γ((4k +4)/4) = Γ((2k +3)/4)Γ((2k +1)/4)/Γ(k +1).

Therefore, the integral is 2^{k - 1/2} * Γ((2k +3)/4)Γ((2k +1)/4)/Γ(k +1).

Putting it back into the series:

sqrt(2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k/(2k+1)! ] * 2^{k - 1/2} Γ((2k +3)/4)Γ((2k +1)/4)/Γ(k +1).

Simplify the constants:

sqrt(2) * 2^{-1/2} = 1. So the series becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k/(2k+1)! ] * 2^{k} Γ((2k +3)/4)Γ((2k +1)/4)/Γ(k +1).

This is the same series as before, confirming the previous result. Therefore, the analytical solution is expressed as this infinite series. However, this doesn't seem to simplify further, so the exact answer is likely expressed in terms of this series.

But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the series is the best we can do, then the exact answer is this infinite series. However, perhaps there's a closed-form expression that I'm missing.

Wait, let's consider the substitution made earlier where the integral became 2√2 ∫₀^∞ [u^2 / sqrt(1 + u^4)] sin( sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4) ) du. Let me make a substitution v = sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4). Then, v = sqrt(2) u / sqrt(1 + u^4). Let's square both sides: v² = 2u² / (1 + u^4). Rearranging: v² (1 + u^4) = 2u² ⇒ v² + v² u^4 = 2u² ⇒ v² u^4 - 2u² + v² =0. This is a quadratic in u²: v² (u²)^2 - 2 u² + v² =0. Solving for u²: u² = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4v^4)]/(2v²) = [1 ± sqrt(1 -v^4)]/v². This is getting too complicated. Not helpful.

Given that I'm unable to find a closed-form solution and the problem requires an exact answer, I might have to conclude that the integral evaluates to a known constant or special function, but I'm not sure which. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is designed to be transformed into a Fresnel integral or a Bessel function, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is equal to π. Let me check with an approximate value. π is approximately 3.1416, but our earlier approximation was around 4.1947, which is higher. So likely not.

Alternatively, sqrt(2)π/2 ≈2.2214, which is lower. Not matching.

Alternatively, the integral might be related to the Fresnel integral. The Fresnel integrals are ∫₀^∞ sin(t²) dt = sqrt(π/8). But our integral is different.

Alternatively, consider the substitution z = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then, the argument of the sine is z^{1/2}. But I don't see a connection.

Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with the series solution as the exact answer and provide the numerical approximation based on the first few terms, but I'm aware that this might not be accurate. However, given the problem's requirements, I'll proceed.

The exact answer is expressed as the infinite series:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n 2^n Γ((2n +3)/4) Γ((2n +1)/4) ] / [ (2n +1)! Γ(n +1) ].

This can be written using Gamma functions, but it's not a standard form. However, the problem might expect a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π, but I need to verify.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then, t = sqrt(x(2 - x)), and we can express the integral in terms of t. However, as previously attempted, this leads to complicated expressions. Alternatively, consider the substitution t = arcsin(sqrt(x/2)). Let me try that.

Let t = arcsin(sqrt(x/2)). Then, sqrt(x/2) = sin t, so x = 2 sin²t, dx = 4 sin t cos t dt. This is similar to the earlier substitution. The integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [2 sin²t]^{-1/2} [2 - 2 sin²t]^{-1} sin(⁴√(2 sin²t * 2 cos²t)) *4 sin t cos t dt.

Simplify:

[2 sin²t]^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} (sin t)^{-1}

[2 cos²t]^{-1} = (2)^{-1} (cos t)^{-2}

The argument inside the sine: ⁴√(4 sin²t cos²t) = (4)^{1/4} (sin t cos t)^{1/2} = sqrt(2) (sin t cos t)^{1/2} = sqrt(2) (sin 2t / 2)^{1/2} = sqrt(2) (sin 2t)^{1/2} / 2^{1/2} = (sin 2t)^{1/2}.

So the integrand becomes:

(2)^{-1/2} (sin t)^{-1} * (2)^{-1} (cos t)^{-2} * sin( (sin 2t)^{1/2} ) *4 sin t cos t dt.

Simplify constants and terms:

2^{-1/2} * 2^{-1} *4 = 4 / 2^{3/2} = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

(sin t)^{-1} * sin t = 1.

(cos t)^{-2} * cos t = (cos t)^{-1} = sec t.

So the integral becomes sqrt(2) ∫₀^{π/2} sec t sin( (sin 2t)^{1/2} ) dt.

This is the same as before. So no progress.

Given that I'm unable to find an analytical solution and the problem requires an exact answer, I might have to conclude that the integral evaluates to a known constant or special function expression. However, without further insight, I'll have to present the series solution as the exact answer and provide a numerical approximation based on the first few terms, acknowledging that this is an approximation.

However, given the problem asks for an exact answer, and given the integral's complexity, I suspect there's a substitution or trick that I'm missing. Let me think again.

Wait, consider the substitution u = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then, u² = x(2 - x). Let me differentiate u with respect to x:

du/dx = (2 - 2x)/(2u) = (1 - x)/u.

But the integrand is x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(u^{1/2}) dx.

But I need to express dx in terms of u and du. From u² = x(2 - x), we have 2u du = (2 - 2x) dx ⇒ dx = (2u du)/(2 - 2x) = (u du)/(1 - x).

But from u² = x(2 - x), we can solve for x: x =1 ± sqrt(1 - u²). For x in [0,1], x =1 - sqrt(1 - u²), and for x in [1,2], x =1 + sqrt(1 - u²). This leads to two integrals:

For x in [0,1], dx = (u du)/(1 - x) = (u du)/sqrt(1 - u²).

The integrand becomes x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1} sin(u^{1/2}) * (u du)/sqrt(1 - u²).

But x =1 - sqrt(1 - u²), so x^{-1/2} = [1 - sqrt(1 - u²)]^{-1/2}.

(2 - x) =1 + sqrt(1 - u²), so (2 - x)^{-1} = [1 + sqrt(1 - u²)]^{-1}.

So the integrand for x in [0,1] is:

[1 - sqrt(1 - u²)]^{-1/2} [1 + sqrt(1 - u²)]^{-1} * sin(u^{1/2}) * u / sqrt(1 - u²) du.

Similarly, for x in [1,2], the integrand would have similar terms but with different signs. This seems too complicated to integrate analytically.

Given that I'm unable to find an exact analytical solution, I'll have to conclude that the integral is expressed as the infinite series derived earlier. However, the problem states to compute it analytically, so perhaps there's a trick I'm missing.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = sqrt(x). Then, x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes:

∫₀^√2 t^{-1} (2 - t²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) *2t dt = 2 ∫₀^√2 (2 - t²)^{-1} sin(⁴√(t²(2 - t²))) dt.

Let me set u = t². Then, t = sqrt(u), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du. The integral becomes:

2 ∫₀² (2 - u)^{-1} sin(⁴√(u(2 - u))) * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du = ∫₀² (2 - u)^{-1} u^{-1/2} sin(⁴√(u(2 - u))) du.

But this is the same as the original integral. So this substitution doesn't help.

Given that I'm truly stuck, I'll have to present the series solution as the exact answer and provide a numerical approximation based on the first few terms. However, I'm aware that this might not be the expected solution. Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π, but my numerical approximation suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the Dirichlet integral or other known integrals involving sine functions. For example, ∫₀^∞ sin(x)/x dx = π/2. But the current integral is different.

Given the time I've spent without progress, I'll proceed to provide the series solution as the exact answer and the numerical approximation based on the first few terms, noting that the exact answer might require a different approach.

Exact answer (infinite series):

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n 2^n Γ((2n +3)/4) Γ((2n +1)/4) ] / [ (2n +1)! Γ(n +1) ]

Numerical approximation: Approximately 4.19477 (based on first few terms).

However, given the problem's requirement for an exact answer, I might have missed a trick. Alternatively, the integral might evaluate to π√2, which is approximately 4.4429, but my approximation with the first term being π√2 and subsequent terms reducing it suggests the exact answer is less than that. Alternatively, the integral might be 2^{1/4} Γ(3/4)^2 / sqrt(π), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the Beta function or Gamma function in a specific way. For example, the first term in the series was π√2, which is Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4)/sqrt(2) = π√2. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the exact answer is the infinite series and the numerical approximation is approximately 4.19477. However, I'm not confident in this result. Perhaps consulting a table of integrals or using a CAS would help, but without access, I'll proceed.
