Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of e raised to the power of negative (x minus 2024) squared over 4, from negative infinity to positive infinity. Hmm, this looks like a Gaussian integral. I remember that the standard Gaussian integral is the integral of e^(-x²) dx from -∞ to ∞, which equals the square root of π. But here, the exponent is a bit different. Let me think about how to adjust for that.

First, the given integral is ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(x - 2024)^2 / 4} dx. Let me make a substitution to simplify it. Let’s set u = (x - 2024)/√2. Wait, why √2? Because the exponent has a denominator of 4. Let me check. The standard form is usually e^{-(x - μ)^2 / (2σ²)}, which integrates to σ√(2π). Comparing that to our exponent, which is -(x - 2024)^2 /4, so 2σ² = 4, so σ² = 2, so σ = √2. Therefore, the integral should be σ√(2π) = √2 * √(2π) = √(4π) = 2√π. Wait, let me verify that.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution directly. Let’s set t = (x - 2024)/√2. Then, x = √2 t + 2024, and dx = √2 dt. The exponent becomes -( (√2 t)^2 ) /4 = -(2t²)/4 = -t²/2. Wait, but the original exponent is -(x - 2024)^2 /4. If t = (x - 2024)/√2, then (x - 2024) = √2 t, so (x - 2024)^2 = 2 t². Then, 2t² /4 = t²/2. So the exponent becomes -t²/2. Then the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-t²/2} * √2 dt. Because dx = √2 dt. The integral of e^{-t²/2} dt from -∞ to ∞ is √(2π), right? Because the standard Gaussian integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-t²/2} dt = √(2π). So multiplying by √2 gives √2 * √(2π) = √(4π) = 2√π. So the exact answer should be 2√π.

Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-a(x - b)^2} dx = √(π/a). Let me confirm that formula. If a is positive, then yes. So in this case, the exponent is -(x - 2024)^2 /4, which can be written as -a(x - b)^2 where a = 1/4 and b = 2024. Then the integral would be √(π/a) = √(π/(1/4)) = √(4π) = 2√π. So that matches the previous result. Therefore, the exact value is 2√π.

So step 1: Recognize the integral is a Gaussian form. Step 2: Use substitution or recall the standard formula. Step 3: Apply the formula with a = 1/4, leading to 2√π. Then, the numerical approximation. Since √π is approximately 1.7724538509, so 2 times that is approximately 3.5449077018. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 3.5449077018. Let me check with a calculator. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so sqrt(π) ≈ 1.7724538509, multiplying by 2 gives 3.5449077018. Yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is 2√π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 3.5449077018. Therefore, the JSON output should be {"answer": "2\\sqrt{\\pi}", "numerical_answer": "3.5449077018"}.
