Okay, so I need to calculate the definite integral of e raised to the power of negative (x minus 2024) squared divided by 4, integrated from negative infinity to positive infinity. Hmm, let me think. I remember that integrals of Gaussian functions like e^{-x²} have known results. But here, there's a shift and a scaling factor. Let me recall the standard Gaussian integral first.

The standard integral is ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-ax²} dx = √(π/a). But in this case, the exponent is -(x - 2024)² /4. So maybe I can rewrite it in the form of e^{-a(x - b)²} to match the standard form. Let's see. If I let a = 1/4, then the exponent becomes -a(x - 2024)². So according to the standard formula, the integral should be √(π/a). Substituting a = 1/4, that would be √(π/(1/4)) = √(4π) = 2√π. Wait, but does the shift affect the integral? Because the standard integral is centered at 0, but here it's shifted to 2024. But since we're integrating from -∞ to ∞, shifting the center doesn't change the value of the integral. The integral over all real numbers of a Gaussian function is the same regardless of the center. So the shift by 2024 doesn't affect the result. Therefore, the integral should be 2√π. 

Let me verify that. Suppose I make a substitution u = x - 2024. Then du = dx, and when x approaches ±∞, u also approaches ±∞. So the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-u²/4} du. Then, using the standard formula with a = 1/4, the integral is √(π/(1/4)) = √(4π) = 2√π. Yep, that checks out. So the exact answer is 2√π. 

Now, for the numerical approximation. I need to compute 2 times the square root of π. Let me recall that π is approximately 3.141592653589793. Taking the square root of that gives sqrt(π) ≈ 1.7724538509055159. Then multiplying by 2 gives approximately 3.5449077018110318. Rounding this to 10 decimal places would be 3.5449077018. Let me check with a calculator to confirm. Yes, sqrt(π) is approximately 1.77245385091, so 2 times that is about 3.54490770182. Rounded to 10 decimals, it's 3.5449077018. 

So the exact answer is 2√π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 3.5449077018. I think that's all. Let me just make sure there are no mistakes in the substitution. The substitution u = x - 2024 is valid because the differential du = dx, and the limits remain from -infty to infty. So the integral is indeed the same as the standard Gaussian integral scaled by 1/4 in the exponent. Therefore, the result is correct.
