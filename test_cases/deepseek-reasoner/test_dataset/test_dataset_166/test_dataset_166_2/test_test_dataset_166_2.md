Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/2 of sin²ⁿx divided by (sin²ⁿx + cos²ⁿx) dx. Hmm, let's see. I remember that integrals from 0 to π/2 sometimes have symmetry properties that can be exploited. Maybe substitution? Let me think.

First, the integrand is sin²ⁿx over (sin²ⁿx + cos²ⁿx). If I make a substitution like t = π/2 - x, which is a common trick for integrals over this interval. Let's try that. When x = 0, t = π/2, and when x = π/2, t = 0. The differential dx becomes -dt, so the integral becomes the integral from π/2 to 0 of [sin²ⁿ(π/2 - t) / (sin²ⁿ(π/2 - t) + cos²ⁿ(π/2 - t))] (-dt). Flipping the limits, it's the integral from 0 to π/2 of [cos²ⁿt / (cos²ⁿt + sin²ⁿt)] dt. So that's the same as the original integrand but with sin and cos swapped. Let me call the original integral I. Then, after substitution, I get that I is equal to the integral of cos²ⁿx over (sin²ⁿx + cos²ⁿx) dx from 0 to π/2. Let's call that integral J. So, I + J would be the integral of (sin²ⁿx + cos²ⁿx)/(sin²ⁿx + cos²ⁿx) dx from 0 to π/2, which is just the integral of 1 dx from 0 to π/2. That's π/2. So, I + J = π/2. But since the substitution showed that I = J, then 2I = π/2, so I = π/4. Wait, that seems too straightforward. But does this hold for any n?

Wait, let me check. If n is an integer, then sin²ⁿx and cos²ⁿx are both raised to even powers. But when I did the substitution t = π/2 - x, sin(π/2 - t) = cos t, and cos(π/2 - t) = sin t. So the substitution does swap sin and cos. Therefore, the integral I becomes the integral of cos²ⁿt / (cos²ⁿt + sin²ⁿt) dt, which is the same as J. Therefore, I = J. Then, since I + J = π/2, each must be π/4. So the integral is π/4 regardless of n? That seems surprising. Let me test with n=1. If n=1, the integrand is sin²x/(sin²x + cos²x) = sin²x, since sin²x + cos²x =1. Then the integral from 0 to π/2 of sin²x dx. The integral of sin²x is (x - sinx cosx)/2 evaluated from 0 to π/2. At π/2, sinx cosx is 0, and x is π/2. At 0, it's 0. So the integral is (π/2)/2 = π/4. So that works. For n=1, it's π/4. What about n=2? Let's see. The integrand is sin⁴x/(sin⁴x + cos⁴x). Let me compute the integral numerically for n=2. Maybe approximate it. Let's take x from 0 to π/2. At x=0, sinx=0, so integrand is 0. At x=π/4, sinx=cosx=√2/2, so integrand is ( ( (√2/2)^4 ) / (2*(√2/2)^4 ) ) = 1/2. At x=π/2, integrand is 1. So the function goes from 0 to 1, passing through 1/2 at π/4. But integrating this over 0 to π/2. If the integral is π/4, that's the same as n=1. Wait, maybe it's always π/4? Let me check with n=0. If n=0, the integrand is 1/(1+1) = 1/2, so integral is (1/2)(π/2) = π/4. So even n=0 gives π/4. So maybe this is always π/4 regardless of n. That's interesting. So the answer is π/4. But how does that work? Because the integrand seems to vary with n, but the integral remains the same. So the key was the substitution t = π/2 - x, which showed that the integral is equal to itself with sin and cos swapped, leading to the conclusion that the integral is half of π/2. Therefore, the exact answer is π/4. The numerical approximation would be approximately 0.7853981634. Let me confirm with another example. For n=2, let's compute the integral numerically. Let's approximate ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁴x/(sin⁴x + cos⁴x) dx. Let's use substitution. Let me use x from 0 to π/4 and then π/4 to π/2. Maybe symmetry. Let u = π/2 - x in the second interval, then the integral from π/4 to π/2 becomes the integral from 0 to π/4 of cos⁴u/(cos⁴u + sin⁴u) du. So the total integral is 2 times the integral from 0 to π/4 of sin⁴x/(sin⁴x + cos⁴x) dx. But even so, if the total is π/4, then that's the case. Alternatively, maybe use substitution t = tanx. Let x = arctan t, then dx = dt/(1 + t²). Then sinx = t/√(1 + t²), cosx = 1/√(1 + t²). The integrand becomes (t^{2n}/(1 + t²)^n) / (t^{2n}/(1 + t²)^n + 1/(1 + t²)^n) ) = t^{2n}/(t^{2n} + 1). So the integral becomes ∫₀^{∞} t^{2n}/(t^{2n} + 1) * dt/(1 + t²). So the integral is ∫₀^∞ t^{2n}/( (t^{2n} + 1)(1 + t²) ) dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. But maybe using substitution u = 1/t. Let u = 1/t, then when t approaches 0, u approaches ∞, and vice versa. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ( (1/u)^{2n} ) / ( (1/u)^{2n} + 1 ) * (1/(1 + (1/u)^2 )) * ( -du/u² ). Adjusting the limits, it becomes ∫₀^∞ (u^{-2n} )/(u^{-2n} + 1) * u²/(1 + u²) * du/u². Simplify numerator and denominator: u^{-2n}/(u^{-2n} + 1) = 1/(1 + u^{2n}). Then multiplied by u²/(1 + u²) * 1/u² = 1/(1 + u²). So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + u^{2n}) * 1/(1 + u²) du. Wait, but the original integral after substitution is equal to this. Let me call the original integral I. Then I = ∫₀^∞} t^{2n}/( (t^{2n} + 1)(1 + t²) ) dt. Then after substitution u=1/t, I = ∫₀^∞ 1/( (1 + u^{2n})(1 + u²) ) du. So adding these two expressions for I: I + I = ∫₀^∞ [ t^{2n}/( (t^{2n} + 1)(1 + t²) ) + 1/( (1 + t^{2n})(1 + t²) ) ] dt = ∫₀^∞ (t^{2n} + 1)/( (t^{2n} + 1)(1 + t²) ) dt = ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + t²) dt = [arctan t]₀^∞ = π/2. Therefore, 2I = π/2, so I = π/4. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of n, the integral is π/4. So the exact answer is π/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7853981634. So the answer is π/4, and the value is about 0.7853981634.
