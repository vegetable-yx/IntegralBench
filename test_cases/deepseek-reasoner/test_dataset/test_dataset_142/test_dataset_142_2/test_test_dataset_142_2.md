Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of arccos(x) multiplied by the modified Bessel function of the first kind I_0(2x) dx. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of these functions. 

First, the arccos function, which is the inverse of cosine, and I_0 is the modified Bessel function. I remember that Bessel functions often come up in solutions to differential equations, especially in cylindrical coordinates. But how do I integrate their product with arccos?

Maybe integration by parts could work here. Let me set u = arccos(x) and dv = I_0(2x) dx. Then du would be -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v would be the integral of I_0(2x) dx. Wait, do I know the integral of I_0(2x)? Let me check. The integral of I_0(kx) dx is (1/k) * x I_1(kx) + C, maybe? Let me verify that.

Yes, I think the derivative of x I_1(kx) is k x I_0(kx) + I_1(kx) - but wait, maybe I need to check a table of integrals. Alternatively, recall that the integral of I_0(ax) dx is (x/a) I_1(ax) + C. So if a=2, then the integral would be (x/2) I_1(2x) + C. Let me confirm that. If I differentiate (x/2) I_1(2x), using the product rule: derivative of x/2 is 1/2, times I_1(2x), plus x/2 times derivative of I_1(2x). The derivative of I_1(2x) with respect to x is 2 I_1’(2x). But the derivative of I_1(z) with respect to z is (I_0(z) - I_1(z)/z). So putting it all together: 1/2 I_1(2x) + x/2 * 2 [I_0(2x) - I_1(2x)/(2x)] = 1/2 I_1(2x) + x [I_0(2x) - I_1(2x)/(2x)] = 1/2 I_1(2x) + x I_0(2x) - (1/2) I_1(2x) = x I_0(2x). So yes, the integral of I_0(2x) dx is (x/2) I_1(2x) + C. Great, so v = (x/2) I_1(2x).

So integration by parts gives us uv from 0 to 1 minus integral of v du. Let's compute uv first. At x=1, arccos(1) is 0, so the first term is 0. At x=0, arccos(0) is π/2, and v at 0 is (0/2) I_1(0) which is 0. So the uv term is 0 - (π/2 * 0) = 0. So the integral becomes - integral from 0 to1 of v du, which is - integral from 0 to1 of (x/2) I_1(2x) * (-1/sqrt(1 - x²)) dx. The negatives cancel, so we have (1/2) ∫ x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²) dx from 0 to1.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to computing ∫ x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²) dx from 0 to1. This seems a bit tricky. Maybe another substitution? Let me think. Let’s set t = sqrt(1 - x²), so that x = sqrt(1 - t²). Then dx = (-t)/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, substitution u = x²? Or perhaps use a series expansion for I_1(2x).

The modified Bessel function I_1(z) can be expressed as a series: I_1(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (z/2)^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k+1)! ) ). So I_1(2x) would be Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k+1)! ). Then multiplying by x and dividing by sqrt(1 - x²), the integrand becomes x * Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +1} / (k! (k+1)! ) ) / sqrt(1 - x²) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k+1)! sqrt(1 - x²)) ).

So the integral becomes (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k+1)! ) ] ∫0^1 x^{2k +2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let me compute that integral. Let’s make substitution x = sinθ, so that dx = cosθ dθ, and sqrt(1 - x²) = cosθ. Then when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. The integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k +2} / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫0^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k +2} dθ. That's a standard Beta function integral. The integral from 0 to π/2 of sin^{n}θ dθ = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n+1)/2) / Γ((n+2)/2). For n = 2k +2, this becomes (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((2k +3)/2) / Γ((2k +4)/2). Simplify that. Since Γ(m +1) = m Γ(m), so Γ((2k +4)/2) = Γ(k +2) = (k +1)! and Γ((2k +3)/2) can be expressed using the double factorial or other identities. Let me recall that Γ((2k +3)/2) = (2k +1)!! / 2^{k +1} } sqrt(π). Wait, maybe not. Let me check for specific k. For k=0: Γ(3/2) = (1/2) sqrt(π). For k=1: Γ(5/2) = (3/2)(1/2)sqrt(π) = 3 sqrt(π)/4. So in general, Γ((2k +3)/2) = ( (2k +1)!! / 2^{k +1} ) sqrt(π). Similarly, Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So substituting back, the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * [ ( (2k +1)!! / 2^{k +1} ) sqrt(π) ) ] / ( (k +1)! ) ). Simplify this expression. Let's compute:

sqrt(π)/2 * ( (2k +1)!! sqrt(π) ) / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! ) )

= π / 2^{k +2} * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...3*1. Also, note that (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ). Let me verify that. For example, 5!! = 5*3*1 = 15, and 5! = 120, 2^2 * 2! = 8*2=16, which is not 15. Hmm, maybe another identity. Alternatively, (2k +1)!! = product_{i=0}^k} (2i +1) = 2^{k +1} Γ(k + 3/2)/sqrt(π). Wait, perhaps using the relation between double factorials and Gamma functions. 

Alternatively, Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π) / 2^{k +1}. So then (2k +1)!! = 2^{k +1} Γ(k + 3/2) / sqrt(π). Substituting back into the integral expression:

π / 2^{k +2} * [2^{k +1} Γ(k + 3/2) / sqrt(π) ] / ( (k +1)! )

= π / 2^{k +2} * 2^{k +1} / sqrt(π) * Γ(k + 3/2) / (k +1)! )

Wait, no, the Γ(k + 3/2) is not correct. Wait, original substitution was Γ((2k +3)/2) = Γ(k + 3/2). So the integral expression becomes:

π / 2^{k +2} * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But using the identity (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ), so substituting:

= π / 2^{k +2} * ( (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ) / (k +1)! )

= π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me check for k=0. For k=0, the original integral is ∫0^1 x^2 / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Let's compute that directly. Substitute x = sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ, integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} sin²θ dθ = π/4. Using the Beta function formula, which is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(3/2)/Γ(2) = (sqrt(π)/2) * (sqrt(π)/2) / 1! ) = π/4. So that's correct. Now using the expression I derived above for general k:

For k=0, the expression would be π (1)! / (2^{2*0 +2} 0! 1! ) ) = π *1 / (4 *1 *1) = π/4, which matches. So the general term is π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} (k! (k +1)! ) ). Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 x^{2k +2}/sqrt(1 -x²) dx = π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} (k! (k +1)! ) ).

Therefore, the original integral becomes (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k+1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} (k! (k +1)! ) )

Simplify this expression:

= (1/2) * π / 2^{2k +2} * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 )

Wait, let's factor out constants:

= (π / 2^{2k +3}) ) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 )

Wait, no, the 2^{2k +2} is inside the sum, so each term has 1/2^{2k +2}, and the 1/2 from the (1/2) factor. So overall:

= (π / 2) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1 / 2^{2k +2} )

= (π / 2^{3}) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1 / 2^{2k} )

= (π / 8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)^2 ) ) ] * (1 / 4^k )

Wait, maybe simplifying the term. Let's write (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! and (k +1)! = (k +1)k! So (k! (k +1)! )^2 = (k! )^2 (k +1)^2 (k! )^2? Wait, no. Wait, (k! (k +1)! ) = k! * (k +1)! = (k +1) (k! )^2. So (k! (k +1)! )^2 = (k +1)^2 (k! )^4. Wait, no, let's compute:

(k! (k +1)! ) = k! * (k +1)! = k! * (k +1) k! = (k +1) (k! )^2. Therefore, (k! (k +1)! )^2 = (k +1)^2 (k! )^4. So the term becomes:

(2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) = (2k +1)(2k)! / ( (k +1)^2 (k! )^4 )

But (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...(k +1)k! So maybe express in terms of binomial coefficients. Alternatively, recall that (2k)! / (k! )^2 = C(2k, k). So then:

(2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) = (2k +1) (2k)! / ( (k +1)^2 (k! )^4 )

= (2k +1) / (k +1)^2 * (2k)! / (k! )^2 * 1 / (k! )^2

But (2k)! / (k! )^2 = C(2k, k), so:

= (2k +1) / (k +1)^2 * C(2k, k) / (k! )^2

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of the central binomial coefficients. Let me see if there's a known series for this sum. Alternatively, maybe recognize the series as a hypergeometric function. The sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k ) could be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function. Let's compute the general term. Let's write the term as:

a_k = (2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

Let me compute a_k for the first few terms. For k=0: (1)! / (0! 1! )^2 *1 = 1 / (1 *1) =1. So a_0=1. For k=1: (3)! / (1! 2! )^2 *1/4 =6 / (1*4) *1/4=6/(16)=3/8. For k=2:5!/(2! 3! )^2 *1/16=120/( (2*6)^2 ) *1/16=120/(144)*1/16= (5/6)/16=5/(96). Hmm, so the terms are 1, 3/8, 5/96, etc. Not sure if that's a known series. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric function _pF_q is defined as Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (a1)_k ... (ap)_k ) / ( (b1)_k ... (bq)_k ) * z^k /k! ). Let's see. The term here is (2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4)^k. Let's manipulate this:

(2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! = (2k +1)(2k)(2k -1)...(k +1)k! ). Not sure. Alternatively, write (2k +1)! = (2k +1) (2k)! = (2k +1) (2k)!.

But (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...(k +1)k! ). So (2k)! / (k! )^2 = C(2k, k). So then:

(2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 = (2k +1) C(2k, k) / ( (k +1)! )^2 )

But (k +1)! = (k +1)k! So (k +1)! )^2 = (k +1)^2 (k! )^2. Therefore:

= (2k +1) C(2k, k) / ( (k +1)^2 (k! )^2 )

But C(2k, k) = (2k)! / (k! )^2, so:

= (2k +1) (2k)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)^2 (k! )^2 )

Wait, no, that seems messy. Maybe another approach. Let's write the term as:

(2k +1)! / ( (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) = (2k +1) / ( (k +1)^2 ) * ( (2k)! ) / ( (k! )^4 )

But I don't see a simplification here. Maybe use generating functions. Alternatively, check if this sum is related to known integrals or constants. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach to the original integral.

Wait, maybe instead of expanding I_1(2x) into a series, there's a different substitution or integral representation. Let me recall that modified Bessel functions can be expressed as integrals. For example, I_0(z) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{z cosθ} dθ. Similarly, I_1(z) has an integral representation. Maybe using such representations could help.

Alternatively, perhaps switch the order of integration. Let me think. The original integral is ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. If I express I_0(2x) as an integral, then maybe interchange the integrals. For example, I_0(2x) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2x cosθ} dθ. Then the original integral becomes (1/π) ∫0^1 arccos(x) [ ∫0^π e^{2x cosθ} dθ ] dx. Switching the order of integration, we get (1/π) ∫0^π [ ∫0^1 arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx ] dθ. Now, the inner integral is ∫0^1 arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx. Maybe this is easier to compute?

Let me consider integrating by parts here. Let u = arccos(x), dv = e^{2x cosθ} dx. Then du = -1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, and v = (1/(2 cosθ)) e^{2x cosθ}. So integration by parts gives uv from 0 to1 minus ∫ v du. The uv term at x=1: arccos(1)=0, v(1) = (1/(2 cosθ)) e^{2 cosθ}. So 0 - [ arccos(0) * v(0) ] = 0 - (π/2 * (1/(2 cosθ)) e^{0} ) = - π/(4 cosθ). Then the integral becomes - π/(4 cosθ) + (1/(2 cosθ)) ∫0^1 e^{2x cosθ} / sqrt(1 -x²) dx.

So the inner integral is -π/(4 cosθ) + (1/(2 cosθ)) ∫0^1 e^{2x cosθ} / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Therefore, the original integral becomes (1/π) ∫0^π [ -π/(4 cosθ) + (1/(2 cosθ)) ∫0^1 e^{2x cosθ} / sqrt(1 -x²) dx ] dθ. Let's split this into two terms:

Term1: (1/π) ∫0^π -π/(4 cosθ) dθ = -1/4 ∫0^π 1/cosθ dθ. But 1/cosθ is secθ, which has a singularity at θ=π/2. The integral of secθ from 0 to π is divergent. Hmm, that's a problem. This suggests that switching the order of integration might not be valid here, or that this approach leads to a divergent integral. Maybe this path isn't the right way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a differential equation approach. Let me denote the original integral as J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Let me consider differentiating J with respect to a parameter. But since there's no obvious parameter here, maybe integrating factors or other techniques.

Wait, another thought: the integral ∫ arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx might be expressible in terms of known functions if we can relate it to derivatives or integrals of Bessel functions. Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of arccos(x). Recall that arccos(x) = ∫x^1 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. So maybe express arccos(x) as an integral and then interchange the order. Let's try that.

So J = ∫0^1 [ ∫x^1 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt ] I_0(2x) dx. Switching the order of integration, the limits for t are from 0 to1, and for x from 0 to t. So J = ∫0^1 [ ∫0^t I_0(2x) dx ] / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. The inner integral ∫0^t I_0(2x) dx. As before, the integral of I_0(2x) is (x/2) I_1(2x). So evaluated from 0 to t, it's (t/2) I_1(2t) - 0. So J = ∫0^1 (t/2) I_1(2t) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Wait, but this is exactly the same integral we arrived at earlier after the first integration by parts! So we're back to the same point. So this approach doesn't help us further.

Hmm. So maybe we need to proceed with the series expansion approach. Let's go back to the sum:

J = (π / 8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k )

Wait, no, earlier we had:

J = (π / 2^{3}) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1 / 2^{2k} )

Which simplifies to (π / 8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k )

Wait, no, 2^{3} is 8, and 2^{2k} is 4^k. So the sum is (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k )

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck:

Original expression after substitution:

(1/2) * [ π / 2^{2k +2} ] * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 )

Wait, no, the 2^{2k +2} is inside the sum. So each term in the sum is multiplied by 1/2^{2k +2}, and then multiplied by (1/2) from outside. So total factor is (1/2) * 1/2^{2k +2} = 1/2^{2k +3}. But also, the sum has π from the integral. So overall:

J = (π/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/2^{2k +2} )

= (π/2^{3}) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k )

= (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k )

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me compute the first few terms numerically to see if it converges and what the value might be. Let's compute the sum S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ a_k where a_k = (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

For k=0: a_0 = 1! / (0!^2 1!^2 ) *1 =1 / (1*1) =1

k=1: 3! / (1!^2 2!^2 ) *1/4 =6 / (1*4) *1/4=6/16=3/8=0.375

k=2:5! / (2!^2 3!^2 ) *1/16=120/(4*36)*1/16=120/(144)*1/16=5/6*1/16≈0.052083333

k=3:7!/(3!^2 4!^2 ) *1/64=5040/(36*576)*1/64=5040/(20736)*1/64≈0.243055555*1/64≈0.003797743

k=4:9!/(4!^2 5!^2 ) *1/256=362880/(576*14400)*1/256=362880/(8294400)*1/256≈0.04375*1/256≈0.0001708984

k=5:11!/(5!^2 6!^2 ) *1/1024=39916800/(14400*518400)*1/1024=39916800/(7464960000)*1/1024≈0.00535*1/1024≈5.224e-6

So the terms are decreasing rapidly. Summing the first few terms:

S ≈1 +0.375 +0.052083333 +0.003797743 +0.0001708984 +5.224e-6 ≈1.430056198. Let's add more terms:

k=6:13!/(6!^2 7!^2 ) *1/4096=6227020800/(518400*25401600)*1/4096=6227020800/(13168189440000)*1/4096≈0.0004723*1/4096≈1.152e-7. So adding this gives ~1.430056198 +1.152e-7≈1.430056313.

So the sum S converges to approximately 1.430056. Then J = π/8 * S ≈ (3.1415926536/8)*1.430056 ≈0.3926990817 *1.430056≈0.5616. But wait, wait, let me compute this more accurately. π/8 ≈0.3926990817. Multiply by 1.430056: 0.3926990817 *1.430056 ≈0.3926990817*1.430056. Let's compute:

0.3927 *1.4300 =0.3927*1=0.3927, 0.3927*0.4=0.15708, 0.3927*0.03=0.011781, 0.3927*0.000056=0.000022. Adding up: 0.3927 +0.15708=0.54978 +0.011781=0.561561 +0.000022≈0.561583. So J≈0.561583. But wait, the original integral was J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. But according to this series sum, the value is approximately 0.561583. Let me check with numerical integration.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the numerical value using a calculator or approximate methods. Let's try to compute the original integral numerically. Let's approximate ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Using numerical integration methods like Simpson's rule or using a calculator.

But since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps use the series expansion. Alternatively, recall that I_0(2x) can be expressed as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k}) / (k! )^2. So the integrand is arccos(x) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k}) / (k! )^2. Then integrating term by term:

J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2] ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx.

So compute each term ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx. Let's compute this integral. Let’s set u = arccos(x), dv = x^{2k} dx. Then du = -1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, v = x^{2k +1}/(2k +1). Integration by parts gives uv from 0 to1 minus ∫ v du. At x=1, arccos(1)=0, so uv is 0. At x=0, arccos(0)=π/2, and v=0^{2k +1}/(2k +1)=0. So the uv term is 0. Then the integral becomes ∫0^1 [x^{2k +1}/(2k +1)] * [1/sqrt(1 -x²)] dx. So:

∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k +1)) ∫0^1 x^{2k +1} / sqrt(1 -x²) dx.

This is similar to the integral we had before. Let’s use substitution x = sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ, sqrt(1 -x²) = cosθ. The integral becomes:

(1/(2k +1)) ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ.

The integral of sin^{n}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n +1)/2)/Γ((n +2)/2). For n=2k +1, this becomes (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Since Γ(k +1) =k! and Γ(k +3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2k +1}) (2k +2)! ) / (k +1)! ). Wait, no. Let me recall that Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1}. So:

∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ = (sqrt(π)/2) * k! / Γ(k + 3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2) * k! / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) ] = (sqrt(π)/2) * k! * 2^{k +1} / ( (2k +1)!! sqrt(π) ) ) = (2^{k} k! ) / (2k +1)!! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...3*1 = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ). Therefore:

= (2^{k} k! ) / ( (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ) = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k +1)) * (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! ) = 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

Therefore, J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] * [2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k} / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) )

Simplify this expression. Let's write 2^{2k} =4^k. So J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) )

This seems like a more manageable series. Let's compute this sum. Let's write out the first few terms:

For k=0: 1 / (1! *1) =1

k=1:4 / (3! *3)=4/(6*3)=4/18=2/9≈0.2222222222

k=2:16 / (5! *5)=16/(120*5)=16/600=4/150≈0.0266666667

k=3:64 / (7! *7)=64/(5040*7)=64/35280≈0.001814058956

k=4:256/(9! *9)=256/(362880*9)=256/3265920≈0.000078375

k=5:1024/(11! *11)=1024/(39916800*11)=1024/439084800≈0.000002333

So summing these terms:

1 +0.2222222222 +0.0266666667 +0.001814058956 +0.000078375 +0.000002333 ≈1.250783655. Adding more terms:

k=6:4096/(13! *13)=4096/(6227020800*13)=4096/80951270400≈5.06e-8, negligible.

So the sum converges to approximately1.250783655. Therefore, J≈1.250783655. Wait, this contradicts the previous estimate of ~0.5615. What's going on here? There must be a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, let's check the steps again. We expressed J as the original integral, then expanded I_0(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k}) / (k! )^2. Then integrated term by term, leading to J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx. Then computed that integral as 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ). So J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ). But when we compute this sum, we get approximately1.25078, but earlier via the other series expansion, we're getting ~0.5615. These two different approaches are giving different results, which suggests a mistake in one of the derivations.

Wait, but the mistake must be in one of the steps. Let me check the second approach again. Starting from J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Expanding I_0(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k}) / (k! )^2. Then J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx. Then integrating by parts:

∫ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k +1)) ∫ x^{2k +1} / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ. Which is equal to (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Then using Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1}, and Γ(k +1) =k!.

So the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * k! / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) ] = (k! * 2^{k +1} ) / ( (2k +1)!! * 2 ) ) = (k! * 2^{k} ) / (2k +1)!! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...3*1 = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! )

So substituting:

= (k! * 2^{k} ) / ( (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ) = (k! * 2^{k} * 2^k k! ) / (2k +1)! ) = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k +1)) * [2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! ] = 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

Therefore, J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] * [2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

This seems correct. Then when we computed the sum, we got approximately1.25078. But earlier, via the other approach, we had J≈0.5615. This discrepancy suggests a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the numerical values.

Wait, perhaps the first approach had a miscalculation. Let me recheck the first approach. In the first approach, after integration by parts, we arrived at J = (1/2) ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then expanding I_1(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), leading to the integrand as Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to the integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ, which was expressed in terms of Gamma functions. Then after simplification, we had J = (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) ] * (1/4^k ). Then computed the first few terms and got S≈1.43, leading to J≈0.5615.

But in the second approach, expanding I_0(2x) and integrating term by term, we get J≈1.25078. These two results are different, which means there must be an error in one of the derivations.

Wait, but the original integral is ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Let me compute this numerically using approximate methods. Let's approximate the integral numerically. Take x=0 to1, and evaluate the integrand at several points.

For example, at x=0: arccos(0)=π/2≈1.5708, I_0(0)=1. So the value is 1.5708*1=1.5708.

At x=0.5: arccos(0.5)=π/3≈1.0472, I_0(1)≈1.266065878. So the integrand is≈1.0472*1.266065878≈1.326.

At x=0.8: arccos(0.8)≈0.6435 radians, I_0(1.6)≈2.279585302. So integrand≈0.6435*2.279585≈1.467.

At x=0.9: arccos(0.9)≈0.4510 radians, I_0(1.8)≈2.7551. Integrand≈0.4510*2.7551≈1.243.

At x=1: arccos(1)=0, I_0(2)≈2.279585302. Integrand=0.

So the integrand starts at ~1.57, increases to around 1.467 at x=0.8, then decreases to 0 at x=1. The area under the curve is likely between 1 and 1.5. The second approach gives J≈1.25, which seems plausible. The first approach gave ~0.56, which is too low. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the first approach.

Let me check the first approach again. After integration by parts, we had J = (1/2) ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then expanding I_1(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), leading to integrand Σ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ. Which is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 3/2)/Γ(k +2). Then using Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1}, and Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) / ( (k +1)! ) ) ] = π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ). So substituting:

= π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (2^k k! (k +1)! ) )

= π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ) )

Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 x^{2k +2}/sqrt(1 -x²) dx = π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

Then J = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

= (π/2^{3}) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

Wait, but in this expression, the denominator is (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2, which is (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 = (k! )^2 ( (k +1) k! ) )^2 = (k! )^4 (k +1)^2. So the term is (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^4 (k +1)^2 ) * (1/4^k )

But in the second approach, we have J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

These two expressions must be equivalent if both derivations are correct. Let's check for k=0:

First approach term: (2*0 +1)! / (0!^4 (0 +1)^2 ) *1/4^0 =1 / (1*1) *1=1. Then multiplied by π/8 gives π/8≈0.3927. But the sum S in the first approach was approximately1.43, so J≈0.3927*1.43≈0.5615.

Second approach term for k=0:4^0 / (1! *1)=1/1=1. Sum is 1 +0.2222+0.0266+...≈1.25.

But these are different results. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the derivations. Let me check the first approach again.

Wait, the first approach after integration by parts gives J = (1/2) ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then expanding I_1(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), leading to integrand Σ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ. Which is correct. Then the integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 3/2)/Γ(k +2). Then using Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} and Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * ( (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) / ( (k +1)! ) ) = π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ), so substituting:

= π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (2^k k! (k +1)! ) )

= π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ) )

Therefore, J = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

= (π/2^{3}) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

But this seems different from the second approach. However, the second approach gives J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

These two expressions must be equivalent if both are correct. Let's check for k=0:

First approach term: (2*0 +1)! / (0!^2 (0 +1)! )^2 *1/4^0 =1 / (1*1) *1. Multiply by π/8: π/8≈0.3927.

Second approach term:4^0 / (1! *1)=1. So the sum starts at1.

But these are different. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the derivations. Let me check the second approach again.

In the second approach, J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Expanding I_0(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k}) / (k! )^2. Then integrating term by term:

J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx. Then integrating by parts, we found that ∫0^1 arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ). Therefore, J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )

This seems correct. Let me compute this sum numerically for a few terms:

k=0:1/(1! *1)=1

k=1:4/(3! *3)=4/(6*3)=4/18=2/9≈0.2222

k=2:16/(5! *5)=16/(120*5)=16/600≈0.0267

k=3:64/(7! *7)=64/5040*7=64/35280≈0.001814

k=4:256/(9! *9)=256/362880*9=256/3265920≈0.0000783

Summing these:1 +0.2222 +0.0267 +0.001814 +0.0000783≈1.2508. This seems plausible.

But according to the first approach, the sum is (π/8) * S where S≈1.43, leading to J≈0.5615. But this contradicts the second approach. Therefore, one of the approaches must be wrong.

The mistake must be in the first approach. Let me check the first approach again. After integration by parts, we have J = (1/2) ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then expanding I_1(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), leading to integrand Σ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ. Which is correct. Then the integral is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 3/2)/Γ(k +2). Then using Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} and Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * ( (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) / ( (k +1)! ) ) = π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ), so substituting:

= π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (2^k k! (k +1)! ) )

= π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ) )

Therefore, J = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

= (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

But this sum is different from the second approach. However, the second approach gives a sum that converges to ~1.25, which is the correct value according to numerical estimation, while the first approach gives a lower value. Therefore, the mistake must be in the first approach.

Upon reflection, the error in the first approach might be in the integration by parts step. Let me recheck:

Original integral: J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx.

Integration by parts: u = arccos(x), dv = I_0(2x) dx.

Then du = -1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ I_0(2x) dx. As previously, v = (x/2) I_1(2x).

Then J = uv|0^1 - ∫0^1 v du.

At x=1: arccos(1)=0, v(1) = (1/2) I_1(2). At x=0: arccos(0)=π/2, v(0)=0. So uv|0^1 =0 - (π/2 *0)=0. Then J = - ∫0^1 (x/2) I_1(2x) * (-1/sqrt(1 -x²)) dx = (1/2) ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 -x²) dx. This step is correct.

Then expanding I_1(2x) as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), leading to integrand Σ x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +2}θ dθ. Which is correct.

The integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 3/2)/Γ(k +2). Then using Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} and Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * ( (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) / ( (k +1)! ) ) = π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)!! / (k +1)! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ), so substituting:

= π/(2^{k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (2^k k! (k +1)! ) )

= π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ) )

Therefore, J = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

= (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

But this sum seems to converge to ~1.43, leading to J≈0.5615, which contradicts the second approach. However, the second approach's result of ~1.25 seems more plausible given the numerical estimation. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the first approach's series expansion or substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach's series converges to the same result but requires more terms. Let me compute more terms of the first approach's sum S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

For k=0:1

k=1:3! / (1!^2 2!^2 ) *1/4=6/(1*4)*1/4=6/16=3/8=0.375

k=2:5! / (2!^2 3!^2 ) *1/16=120/(4*36)*1/16=120/576*1/16=0.2083333333*0.0625=0.01302083333

k=3:7! / (3!^2 4!^2 ) *1/64=5040/(36*576)*1/64=5040/20736*1/64≈0.2430555556*0.015625≈0.003797743

k=4:9! / (4!^2 5!^2 ) *1/256=362880/(576*14400)*1/256=362880/8294400*1/256≈0.04375*0.00390625≈0.0001708984

k=5:11! / (5!^2 6!^2 ) *1/1024=39916800/(14400*518400)*1/1024=39916800/7464960000*0.0009765625≈0.00535*0.0009765625≈0.000005224

k=6:13! / (6!^2 7!^2 ) *1/4096=6227020800/(518400*25401600)*1/4096≈6227020800/13168189440000*0.000244140625≈0.0004723*0.000244140625≈0.0000001153

So summing these terms:

1 +0.375=1.375

+0.01302083333=1.388020833

+0.003797743=1.391818576

+0.0001708984=1.391989475

+0.000005224=1.391994699

+0.0000001153≈1.391994814

So S≈1.391994814. Then J = π/8 * S ≈0.3926990817 *1.391994814≈0.547. This is still lower than the second approach's 1.25. This suggests that there's a fundamental error in one of the approaches.

But wait, the second approach's sum is J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ). Let's compute this sum more accurately:

k=0:1

k=1:4/(3! *3)=4/18≈0.2222222222

k=2:16/(5! *5)=16/600≈0.0266666667

k=3:64/(7! *7)=64/35280≈0.00181405896

k=4:256/(9! *9)=256/3265920≈0.000078375

k=5:1024/(11! *11)=1024/439084800≈0.000002333

k=6:4096/(13! *13)=4096/80951270400≈5.06e-8

Summing these:

1 +0.2222222222=1.2222222222

+0.0266666667=1.2488888889

+0.00181405896=1.2507029479

+0.000078375=1.2507813229

+0.000002333=1.2507836559

+5.06e-8≈1.2507837065

So J≈1.2507837065. This is approximately1.2507837. But according to the first approach, J≈0.547, which is significantly different. This suggests that one of the approaches is incorrect.

But when I considered the numerical estimation of the original integral, the integrand starts at ~1.57 and decreases to 0, with a peak around x=0.8. The area under the curve is likely around1.25, which matches the second approach. Therefore, the first approach must have an error.

Upon reviewing the first approach, the mistake is likely in the integration by parts step. Wait, no, the integration by parts seems correct. Alternatively, the expansion of I_1(2x) might be incorrect. Let me check the series expansion of I_1(z). The modified Bessel function I_1(z) has the series expansion Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k +1} / (k! (k +1)! ). So for I_1(2x), it's Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x)^{2k +1} / (k! (k +1)! ). This is correct. Then the integrand after expansion is x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ). Then substitution x = sinθ, leading to sin^{2k +2}θ / cosθ * cosθ dθ = sin^{2k +2}θ dθ. Which is correct. Then the integral of sin^{2k +2}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 3/2)/Γ(k +2). Which is correct. Then using Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} and Γ(k +2) = (k +1)!.

So the integral becomes π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ). Therefore, J = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * π (2k +1)! / (2^{2k +2} k! (k +1)! ) )

= (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k )

But this sum converges to approximately1.39199, leading to J≈0.547, which contradicts the second approach. However, the second approach's result of ~1.25 is correct based on numerical estimation. Therefore, the mistake must be in the first approach's series expansion.

Wait, the first approach's series expansion after integration by parts gives J = (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k ). But when we compute this sum, it converges to ~1.39199, leading to J≈0.547. However, the second approach's sum is different and gives ~1.25. This suggests that the two approaches are not equivalent, which is impossible since they are both expressions for the same integral. Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the derivations.

Upon closer inspection, the mistake is in the first approach's series expansion. Specifically, when expanding I_1(2x), the series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k +1} ) / (k! (k +1)! ), but when substituting into the integral, the integrand becomes x^{2k +2} / (k! (k +1)! sqrt(1 -x²) ), which is correct. However, when changing variables to x = sinθ, the integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2k +2}θ dθ, which is correct. The evaluation of this integral as π/(2^{2k +2}) * (2k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! ) is correct. Therefore, the first approach's expression for J is (π/8) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +1)! / ( (k! )^2 (k +1)! )^2 ) * (1/4^k ). But this sum converges to ~1.39199, leading to J≈0.547, which contradicts the second approach.

But the second approach's result of ~1.25 is correct, as verified by numerical integration. Therefore, the mistake must be in the first approach's derivation. However, I can't find the error. Therefore, I must conclude that the second approach is correct and the first approach has an error that I can't identify.

Given that, the correct value of the integral is approximately1.2507837. But wait, the original integral is ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Let me check with numerical integration using approximate methods.

Using Simpson's rule with n=4 intervals:

Divide [0,1] into 4 intervals: h=0.25.

Points: x=0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.

Compute the integrand at these points:

At x=0: arccos(0)=π/2≈1.5708, I_0(0)=1. Integrand≈1.5708*1=1.5708.

At x=0.25: arccos(0.25)≈1.3181, I_0(0.5)≈1.063483. Integrand≈1.3181*1.063483≈1.402.

At x=0.5: arccos(0.5)=π/3≈1.0472, I_0(1)≈1.266065878. Integrand≈1.0472*1.266065878≈1.326.

At x=0.75: arccos(0.75)≈0.7227 radians, I_0(1.5)≈1.646723189. Integrand≈0.7227*1.6467≈1.189.

At x=1: integrand=0.

Applying Simpson's rule:

Integral ≈ (h/3)[f(0) +4f(x1)+2f(x2)+4f(x3)+f(x4)]

= (0.25/3)[1.5708 +4*1.402 +2*1.326 +4*1.189 +0]

= (0.0833333)[1.5708 +5.608 +2.652 +4.756]

= (0.0833333)(1.5708 +5.608=7.1788; 7.1788 +2.652=9.8308; 9.8308 +4.756=14.5868)

=0.0833333*14.5868≈1.2156.

This is an approximation with n=4, which gives ~1.2156. With more intervals, the value would approach the true value. The second approach's result of ~1.2507 is closer to this than the first approach's ~0.547. Therefore, the second approach is correct, and the first approach must have an error.

Therefore, the correct value of the integral is approximately1.2507837. But according to the second approach's sum, J=Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) )≈1.2507837. Therefore, the exact answer is this sum, which can be expressed in terms of known functions?

Let me check if this sum can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions. The sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) is not a standard series, but perhaps it can be related to the modified Bessel functions or other special functions. Alternatively, integrating term by term.

Alternatively, consider that the sum is related to the integral of I_0(2x) or I_1(2x). However, I'm not sure. Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as this infinite series, and the numerical approximation is approximately1.2507837.

But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the exact answer can't be expressed in closed form, then the answer would be the series. However, perhaps there is a closed-form expression.

Let me consider the original integral J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Using the integral representation of arccos(x) = ∫x^1 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt, and switching the order of integration, we did earlier, leading to J = ∫0^1 (t/2) I_1(2t) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. But this is the same as the first approach's result, which suggests that J = (1/2) ∫0^1 t I_1(2t) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. But this integral can be expressed in terms of known functions?

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of I_1(2t). For example, I_1(2t) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2t cosθ} cosθ dθ. Then J = (1/2) ∫0^1 t / sqrt(1 -t²) * (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2t cosθ} cosθ dθ dt. Switching the order of integration:

J = (1/(2π)) ∫0^π cosθ ∫0^1 t e^{2t cosθ} / sqrt(1 -t²) dt dθ.

The inner integral is ∫0^1 t e^{2t cosθ} / sqrt(1 -t²) dt. Let me make substitution t = sinφ, dt = cosφ dφ, sqrt(1 -t²) = cosφ. The integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} sinφ e^{2 sinφ cosθ} cosφ dφ = ∫0^{π/2} sinφ cosφ e^{sin(2 cosθ) φ} dφ. Wait, no, the exponent is 2 sinφ cosθ. Hmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, use substitution u = t, dv = e^{2t cosθ} / sqrt(1 -t²) dt. Not sure.

Alternatively, expand e^{2t cosθ} as a series. e^{2t cosθ} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2t cosθ)^n /n! . Then the inner integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n /n! ∫0^1 t^{n +1} / sqrt(1 -t²) dt. Which is similar to previous integrals. Let me compute this integral:

∫0^1 t^{n +1} / sqrt(1 -t²) dt. Substitute t = sinφ, dt = cosφ dφ. Integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} sin^{n +1}φ dφ = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n +2)/2)/Γ((n +3)/2). For even n +1, this can be expressed in terms of factorials. However, this leads to a complicated series.

Therefore, it's best to conclude that the exact answer is the infinite sum J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ), and the numerical approximation is approximately1.2507837. However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If this sum can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions, that would be the exact answer. Otherwise, the sum is the exact answer.

Upon researching, I find that this sum can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function. Specifically, the sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ (4^k) / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) can be written as Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (1)_k (1)_k ) / ( (3/2)_k (2)_k ) * (4^k)/k! ) * 1/(2k +1). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the hypergeometric function notation:

The general term is 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) = 4^k / ( (2k +1) (2k +1)! ) )

But (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! ), so term becomes 4^k / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) )

= (4^k) / ( (2k)! (2k +1)^2 )

This doesn't immediately resemble a standard hypergeometric series. Therefore, it's likely that the integral doesn't have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions and is best expressed as the infinite series. However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the series is considered an exact answer, then that's acceptable. Otherwise, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, consider that the integral J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function or other special functions, but I'm not familiar with such a result. Therefore, the exact answer is the infinite series, and the numerical approximation is approximately1.2507837.

However, the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX. Given that, and the numerical approximation, the final answer should be:

Exact answer: J = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4^k}{(2k+1)! (2k+1)}

Numerical approximation: approximately1.2507837.

But the problem says to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the series is the exact answer, then that's it. However, perhaps there's a closed-form expression. Let me check integral tables or known integrals.

Upon checking, I find that the integral ∫ arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx from 0 to1 is equal to (π/2) [I_0(1)^2 - 1]. This result is obtained from a known integral formula involving Bessel functions and inverse trigonometric functions. Let me verify this.

Suppose J = (π/2) [I_0(1)^2 -1]. Compute this numerically. I_0(1)≈1.266065878. So I_0(1)^2≈1.266065878^2≈1.6028. Then (π/2)(1.6028 -1)= (π/2)(0.6028)≈1.5708*0.6028≈0.947. This doesn't match the numerical result of ~1.25. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.

Another possibility: the integral might be related to the Struve functions. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider differentiating J with respect to a parameter. Let me define J(a) = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(a x) dx. Then dJ/da = ∫0^1 arccos(x) x I_1(a x) dx. But this seems to complicate things further.

Alternatively, consider integrating the original integral by expanding I_0(2x) in a series and integrating term by term, which we did in the second approach, leading to J = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^k / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ). This series can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function _3F_3 or similar, but I'm not certain. For example, the sum resembles:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (4^k) / ( (2k +1)! (2k +1) ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (1)_k (1)_k (1)_k ) / ( (3/2)_k (2)_k (2)_k ) ) * (4^k)/k! )

But this is speculative. Without a known closed-form expression, the exact answer is the infinite series.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact answer: \boxed{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4^k}{(2k+1)! (2k+1)}}

Numerical approximation: approximately1.2507837.

But the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX and the numerical approximation. However, the user might expect a closed-form answer. Given that the integral is non-trivial and doesn't seem to have a standard closed-form, the series is the exact answer. However, I might have missed a trick.

Wait, another approach: consider the integral J = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(2x) dx. Let me differentiate J with respect to a parameter. Let’s set a=2, so J(a) = ∫0^1 arccos(x) I_0(a x) dx. Then dJ/da = ∫0^1 arccos(x) x I_1(a x) dx. But this seems to lead to a more complex integral. Alternatively, integrating by parts again.

Alternatively, consider the integral representation of I_0(2x). But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress towards a closed-form, I'll conclude that the exact answer is the infinite series and the numerical approximation is approximately1.2507837.
