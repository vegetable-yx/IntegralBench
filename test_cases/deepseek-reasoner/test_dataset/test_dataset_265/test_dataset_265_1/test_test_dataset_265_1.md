Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times arccos x multiplied by the Bessel function J₁(2x) dx. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of Bessel functions and integration techniques. 

First, I remember that integrating products of trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions with Bessel functions can be tricky. Maybe integration by parts could work here. Let me think: the integrand is x arccos x J₁(2x). Let's set u = arccos x, so that du/dx = -1/√(1 - x²). Then dv would be x J₁(2x) dx. But I need to find v by integrating dv. Wait, integrating x J₁(2x) dx... Hmm, do I know an antiderivative for x J₁(2x)?

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can simplify the expression. Let me recall that Bessel functions often show up in integrals involving trigonometric functions or when dealing with certain differential equations. The integral might require a series expansion approach. Let me check if expanding J₁(2x) into its power series would help.

The Bessel function J₁(2x) has a series representation: J₁(z) = Σ [(-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)!)] (z/2)^(2k + 1). So substituting z = 2x, we get J₁(2x) = Σ [(-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)!)] x^(2k + 1). Then the integrand becomes x arccos x times this series. So the integral becomes Σ [(-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! 2^{2k + 1})] ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 2} arccos x dx. Wait, but integrating x^{n} arccos x dx might be manageable term by term.

Alternatively, maybe integrating term by term after expanding the Bessel function. Let me try that. So, express J₁(2x) as its power series:

J₁(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] (2x/2)^{2k+1} } = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] x^{2k+1} }.

So the integrand is x * arccos x * Σ [ (-1)^k x^{2k+1} / (k! (k+1)! ) ] = Σ [ (-1)^k x^{2k+2} arccos x / (k! (k+1)! ) ].

Therefore, the integral becomes Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] ∫₀¹ x^{2k+2} arccos x dx. So now, if I can compute the integral ∫ x^{n} arccos x dx from 0 to 1 for n = 2k+2, then I can sum the series.

Let me focus on solving ∫ x^m arccos x dx from 0 to 1, where m is a non-negative integer. Let's set m = 2k + 2. Let's perform integration by parts here. Let u = arccos x, dv = x^m dx. Then du = -1/√(1 - x²) dx, and v = x^{m+1}/(m+1). So integration by parts gives:

uv | from 0 to 1 - ∫ v du = [ arccos x * x^{m+1}/(m+1) ] from 0 to 1 - ∫ x^{m+1}/(m+1) * (-1)/√(1 - x²) dx.

Evaluating the boundary term: at x=1, arccos 1) = 0, and x^{m+1} is 1^{m+1} = 1, so term is 0. At x=0, arccos 0 = π/2, and x^{m+1} is 0, so the entire boundary term is 0. Therefore, the integral becomes (1/(m+1)) ∫₀¹ x^{m+1} / √(1 - x²) dx.

So ∫ x^m arccos x dx = (1/(m+1)) ∫₀¹ x^{m+1} / √(1 - x²) dx.

Now, let's compute that integral. Let me substitute t = x². Then x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. But maybe a better substitution is x = sin θ. Let me try that. Let x = sin θ, so dx = cos θ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. Then √(1 - x²) = cos θ. So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} (sin θ)^{m+1} / cos θ * cos θ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (sin θ)^{m+1} dθ.

So ∫ x^{m+1}/√(1 - x²) dx from 0 to1 is ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{m+1}θ dθ. That's a standard integral. The integral of sin^n θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n+1)/2) / Γ((n+2)/2)). Alternatively, using the beta function: ∫₀^{π/2} sin^n θ dθ = (1/2) B((n+1)/2, 1/2) = (1/2) Γ((n+1)/2) Γ(1/2) / Γ((n/2) + 1).

Since Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), so this becomes (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n+1)/2) / Γ((n/2) + 1).

But n here is m+1. So substituting back, the integral becomes:

sqrt(π)/2 * Γ( (m+2)/2 ) / Γ( (m+3)/2 )

But m = 2k + 2, so m+2 = 2k + 4, so (m+2)/2 = k + 2. And (m+3)/2 = (2k + 5)/2 = k + 2.5.

Wait, let's check: m = 2k + 2, so m+1 = 2k +3. Wait, no, the integral was ∫ sin^{m+1}θ dθ, so n = m+1 = 2k + 3. Wait, no, let's retrace:

Original substitution: m = 2k + 2? Wait, no. Wait, in the integral ∫ x^{m} arccos x dx, we set m = 2k + 2. Then, in the integral, we had ∫ x^{m+1}/√(1 - x²) dx, which after substitution became ∫ sin^{m+1}θ dθ. So m+1 = 2k + 2 +1 = 2k +3. So n = 2k +3. Therefore, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k+3}θ dθ.

The formula for ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{n}θ dθ is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ( (n+1)/2 ) / Γ( (n/2) +1 ). Wait, n is 2k +3. So:

sqrt(π)/2 * Γ( (2k +4)/2 ) / Γ( (2k +3)/2 +1 ) = sqrt(π)/2 * Γ(k +2) / Γ(k + 2.5 )

But Γ(k +2) = (k +1)! and Γ(k + 2.5) can be expressed using the property Γ(z +1) = z Γ(z). Let's see:

Γ(k + 2.5) = (k + 1.5)(k + 0.5) Γ(0.5) / 2^k? Wait, maybe using the double factorial? Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of factorials. Let me recall that Γ(n + 0.5) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n}) (2n)! ) /n! for integer n. But here, k is an integer, so k + 2.5 = (k + 2) + 0.5. So Γ(k + 2.5) = Γ( (k +2) + 0.5 ) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2k +4}) (2k +4)! ) / (k +2)! )? Wait, no, that formula is for Γ(n + 0.5) where n is integer. Let me check:

The formula is Γ(n + 1/2) = ( (2n)! ) / (4^n n! ) ) sqrt(π). So for n = k +2, Γ(k +2 +1/2) = Γ( (k +2) + 1/2 ) = ( (2(k +2))! ) / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) ) sqrt(π).

Therefore, Γ(k +2.5) = sqrt(π) (2k +4)! ) / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) ).

But Γ(k +2) is (k +1)!.

So putting back into the expression:

sqrt(π)/2 * (k +1)! ) / [ sqrt(π) (2k +4)! / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) ) ]

Simplify:

The sqrt(π) cancels. So we have (1/2) * (k +1)! * 4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) / (2k +4)! )

Simplify numerator: 4^{k +2} (k +1)! (k +2)! )

Denominator: 2 (2k +4)! )

But 4^{k +2} = 2^{2k +4}, and (2k +4)! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)...1. Let's see if we can express this in terms of factorials. Let me note that (2k +4)! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)(2*1) ) = 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)(2k +1)...1. Wait, perhaps using the double factorial? Alternatively, maybe express (2k +4)! = 2^{2k +4} (k +2)! (k +2 + 0.5)(k +2 -0.5)... Hmm, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, let's write (2k +4)! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)(2*1) = 2^{k +2} (k +2)! * product_{i=1}^{k +2} (2i -1) )

But maybe that's complicating. Let's instead note that (2k +4)! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)...2*1. Let's factor out 2 from each even term: 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)(2k +1)...1. But the product (2k +3)(2k +1)...1 is the double factorial (2k +3)!!. However, the double factorial (2m)!! = 2^m m! and (2m +1)!! = (2m +1)(2m -1)...1. So (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)(2k +1)...1. Therefore, (2k +4)! = 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!!.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Let's see:

So the expression becomes:

(1/2) * 4^{k +2} (k +1)! (k +2)! ) / [2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! ) ]

Simplify 4^{k +2} = 2^{2k +4}, so numerator is 2^{2k +4} (k +1)! (k +2)! )

Denominator is 2 * 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! ) = 2^{k +3} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! )

So the fraction is [2^{2k +4} (k +1)! (k +2)! ] / [2^{k +3} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! ) ] = [2^{k +1} (k +1)! ] / (2k +3)!! )

But (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)(2k +1)...5*3*1. Let's note that (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )) ). Wait, the double factorial (2m)!! = 2^m m! and (2m +1)!! = (2m +1)! / (2^m m! ). So for m = k +1, (2(k +1) +1)!! = (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )).

Therefore, substituting back:

[2^{k +1} (k +1)! ] / [ (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )) ] = [2^{k +1} (k +1)! * 2^{k +1} (k +1)! ) ] / (2k +3)! )

= [2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ] / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫ x^{2k +2} arccos x dx from 0 to1 is:

(1/(2k +3)) * [2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ] / (2k +3)! )

Wait, but the original integral was (1/(m+1)) times the integral of x^{m+1}/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, which we converted into terms of Γ functions and then into factorials. But perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the integral ∫ x^{m} arccos x dx from 0 to1 is (1/(m+1)) * ∫ x^{m+1}/sqrt(1 -x²) dx. Then substituting x = sinθ, we get ∫ sin^{m+1}θ dθ from 0 to π/2. Then using the formula for the beta function, which is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((m+2)/2)/Γ((m+3)/2). Then substituting m = 2k +2, so (m+2)/2 = k +2, and (m+3)/2 = k + 2.5. So Γ(k +2)/Γ(k +2.5). Then using Γ(k +2.5) = Γ(k +2 + 0.5) = sqrt(π) (2k +4)! ) / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! )) as per the formula Γ(n + 0.5) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / (4^n n! )). Wait, n here would be k +2, so Γ(k +2 +0.5) = Γ(n +0.5) where n =k +2. So Γ(n +0.5) = sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / (4^n n! ). Therefore, Γ(k +2.5) = sqrt(π) (2(k +2))! / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! )).

So Γ(k +2) is (k +1)!.

Therefore, the ratio Γ(k +2)/Γ(k +2.5) becomes (k +1)! / [ sqrt(π) (2k +4)! / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! )) ] = (k +1)! * 4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) / [ sqrt(π) (2k +4)! ) ]

Then multiplying by sqrt(π)/2 from the beta function formula:

sqrt(π)/2 * [ (k +1)! * 4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) / ( sqrt(π) (2k +4)! ) ) ] = (1/2) * [4^{k +2} (k +1)! (k +2)! ) / (2k +4)! ) ]

So the integral ∫ x^{2k +2} arccos x dx from 0 to1 is (1/(2k +3)) times this expression. Wait, no: the original integral was (1/(m+1)) times the beta function result. Since m =2k +2, m+1 =2k +3. So the integral = (1/(2k +3)) * [ (1/2) *4^{k +2} (k +1)! (k +2)! ) / (2k +4)! ) ]

Simplify 4^{k +2} = 2^{2k +4}, and 2k +4! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)...1. Let's see if we can write this in terms of factorials. Let's note that (2k +4)! = (2k +4)(2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)...1. Let's factor out 2 from each even term: 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)(2k +1)...1. The product (2k +3)(2k +1)...1 is the double factorial (2k +3)!!. So (2k +4)! = 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!!.

Therefore, substituting back:

(1/(2k +3)) * [ (1/2) * 2^{2k +4} (k +1)! (k +2)! ) / (2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! ) ) ]

Simplify numerator: 2^{2k +4} (k +1)! (k +2)! )

Denominator: 2 * 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! )

So the fraction becomes:

[2^{2k +4} (k +1)! (k +2)! ] / [2 * 2^{k +2} (k +2)! (2k +3)!! ) ] = [2^{k +2} (k +1)! ] / [2 (2k +3)!! ) ] = [2^{k +1} (k +1)! ] / (2k +3)!! )

But (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)(2k +1)...5*3*1. And using the identity (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)! ) / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )). Therefore:

[2^{k +1} (k +1)! ] / [ (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )) ] = [2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ] / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫ x^{2k +2} arccos x dx from 0 to1 is:

(1/(2k +3)) * [2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ] / (2k +3)! )

But this seems complicated. Let's see if we can simplify this expression. Let's write it as:

(2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ) / [ (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ]

But (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)...1. Let's write (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)! ). So:

= (2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ) / [ (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)! ) ]

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the duplication formula for Gamma functions. But maybe this is getting too involved. Let's try to compute this term for small k and see if a pattern emerges.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think again. The original integral is ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx. Maybe instead of expanding J₁(2x) into a series, we can use integral representations of Bessel functions. For example, J₁(2x) can be represented as an integral involving cosines. The Bessel function has an integral representation:

J_n(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(nθ - z sinθ) dθ.

But for n=1, J₁(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(θ - z sinθ) dθ. Wait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, another integral representation: J_1(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ - θ) dθ. Maybe substituting this into the integral and swapping the order of integration.

So the original integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x arccos x [ (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ - θ) dθ ] dx.

Swapping the integrals:

(1/π) ∫₀^π [ ∫₀¹ x arccos x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx ] dθ.

But integrating x arccos x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx seems challenging. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me think. Let’s denote the integral as I = ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx. Maybe express arccos x as an integral. Since arccos x = ∫ₓ¹ 1/√(1 - t²) dt. So substituting this into I:

I = ∫₀¹ x J₁(2x) [ ∫ₓ¹ 1/√(1 - t²) dt ] dx.

Swap the order of integration:

= ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^t x J₁(2x) / √(1 - t²) dx ] dt.

So changing the order, for t from 0 to1, x from 0 to t. Then:

I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1 - t²) ∫₀^t x J₁(2x) dx dt.

Now, compute the inner integral ∫₀^t x J₁(2x) dx. Let me recall that ∫ x J₁(ax) dx = (x/a) J₀(ax) + C. Wait, let's check:

The integral of x J₁(ax) dx. Let’s set u = ax, then du = a dx, dx = du/a. The integral becomes ∫ (u/a) J₁(u) (du/a) ) = (1/a²) ∫ u J₁(u) du. The integral of u J₁(u) du is -u J₀(u) + ∫ J₀(u) du. Wait, but I might be misremembering. Let me check differentiation formulas. 

We know that d/dx [x J₁(x)] = x J₀(x). Wait, let's verify:

Using the identity d/dx [x^n J_n(x)] = x^n J_{n-1}(x). For n=1: d/dx [x J₁(x)] = x J₀(x). Therefore, integrating x J₀(x) dx = x J₁(x) + C. But we have ∫ x J₁(ax) dx. Let me make substitution u = ax, then:

∫ x J₁(ax) dx = (1/a²) ∫ u J₁(u) du. Let’s integrate by parts. Let’s set v = u, dw = J₁(u) du. Then dv = du, and w = -J₀(u) (since ∫ J₁(u) du = -J₀(u) + C). So integration by parts gives:

v w - ∫ w dv = -u J₀(u) + ∫ J₀(u) du.

But ∫ J₀(u) du doesn't have a closed form in terms of elementary functions, but it's known to be π/2 [H_0(u) J_1(u) - H_1(u) J_0(u)] + C, where H_n is the Struve function. This might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler expression for the definite integral from 0 to t.

Wait, but if we consider the integral from 0 to t of x J₁(ax) dx. Let's use the identity that ∫₀^z x J₁(ax) dx = (z/a) J₁(az) - (1/a²) ∫₀^az J₁(u) du. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, using the identity d/dx [x J₁(ax)] = a x J₀(ax). Wait, let's compute d/dx [x J₁(ax)]:

Using product rule: J₁(ax) + x * d/dx J₁(ax). The derivative of J₁(ax) with respect to x is a J₁’(ax). And using the identity J₁’(z) = (J₀(z) - J₂(z))/2. But this might not help. Alternatively, from the standard derivative: d/dx [x J₁(ax)] = a x J₀(ax). Wait, let me check with a=1:

d/dx [x J₁(x)] = J₁(x) + x J₁’(x). From Bessel function identities, J₁’(x) = (J₀(x) - J₂(x))/2. So:

= J₁(x) + x (J₀(x) - J₂(x))/2. Not sure if this equals x J₀(x). Let me check for small x. For x, J₀(x) ≈1, J₁(x) ≈x/2, J₂(x) ≈x²/8. Then:

Left side: d/dx [x*(x/2)] = d/dx (x²/2) = x.

Right side: x J₀(x) ≈x*1 =x. So it matches. Therefore, the identity holds: d/dx [x J₁(x)] = x J₀(x). Therefore, integrating both sides from 0 to z:

x J₁(x) |₀^z = ∫₀^z x J₀(x) dx. Therefore, ∫₀^z x J₀(x) dx = z J₁(z).

But in our case, the integral is ∫₀^t x J₁(ax) dx. Let's consider a substitution. Let’s set u = ax, so x = u/a, dx = du/a. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{at} (u/a) J₁(u) * (du)/a ) = (1/a²) ∫₀^{at} u J₁(u) du.

Using the same identity as above, but we need to relate ∫ u J₁(u) du. Let's integrate by parts. Let’s set v = u, dw = J₁(u) du. Then dv = du, w = -J₀(u). So:

∫ u J₁(u) du = -u J₀(u) + ∫ J₀(u) du.

But ∫ J₀(u) du doesn't have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions, but it can be expressed in terms of Struve functions. However, for the integral from 0 to z, we have:

∫₀^z u J₁(u) du = -u J₀(u) |₀^z + ∫₀^z J₀(u) du = -z J₀(z) + 0 + ∫₀^z J₀(u) du.

But ∫₀^z J₀(u) du is known as the integrated Bessel function, which is equal to 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ J_{2k+1}(z) } according to some sources. Alternatively, it can be expressed using Struve functions: ∫ J₀(u) du = (π/2) [H₀(z) J₁(z) - H₁(z) J₀(z)] + C. This seems complicated, but perhaps for our purposes, we can leave it as is.

Therefore, the inner integral ∫₀^t x J₁(2x) dx = (1/(2²)) [ -2t J₀(2t) + ∫₀^{2t} J₀(u) du ].

So substituting back into I:

I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1 - t²) [ (1/4) (-2t J₀(2t) + ∫₀^{2t} J₀(u) du ) ] dt

= (1/4) ∫₀¹ [ (-2t J₀(2t) + ∫₀^{2t} J₀(u) du ) / √(1 - t²) ] dt

This seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let's go back to the series expansion method.

Recall that we had:

I = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] * [ (2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ) / ( (2k +3)^2 (2k +3)! ) ) ]

Wait, no, earlier we had:

The integral ∫ x^{2k +2} arccos x dx from 0 to1 is (1/(2k +3)) * [2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ] / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, substituting back into the original series:

I = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] * [ (2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² ) / ( (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ) ]

Simplify the terms:

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k+1)! ) ] * [ 2^{2k +2} (k +1)!² / ( (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ) ]

Cancel (k +1)! terms:

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / k! ] * [ 2^{2k +2} (k +1) / ( (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ]

This series seems quite complicated. Maybe we can relate it to known functions or simplify further. Let's see if (2k +3)! can be expressed in terms of factorials. Note that (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)!.

So:

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3) (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

This is getting too messy. Perhaps there's a generating function or a hypergeometric function involved. Let's recall that hypergeometric functions can represent such series. The general form is _pF_q(a; b; z). Let's see if this series can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function.

The term ratio a_{k+1}/a_k would be:

[ (-1)^{k+1} 2^{2(k+1) +2} (k +2) ] / [ (k+1)! (2(k+1) +3)^2 (2(k+1) +2)(2(k+1) +1)! ) ] * [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) / (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ) ]

This is quite complex. Maybe this isn't the right path. Alternatively, perhaps numerical integration would be more straightforward for obtaining the numerical approximation, but the problem requires an analytical solution first.

Alternatively, let's consider integrating by parts the original integral. Let’s set u = arccos x, dv = x J₁(2x) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ x J₁(2x) dx. As before, but we saw that integrating x J₁(2x) dx leads to Struve functions. But perhaps for the definite integral from 0 to1, there's a simplification.

Alternatively, using the integral representation of J₁(2x). For example, J₁(2x) can be expressed as a series or via an integral. Alternatively, using the Laplace transform or other integral transforms.

Alternatively, consider differentiation under the integral sign with respect to a parameter. Let's define I(a) = ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(a x) dx. Then compute I(2). Maybe differentiating I(a) with respect to a could lead to a differential equation. Let's try:

Differentiate I(a) with respect to a:

I’(a) = ∫₀¹ x arccos x d/da [ J₁(a x) ] dx.

The derivative of J₁(a x) with respect to a is x J₁’(a x). Using the identity J₁’(z) = (J₀(z) - J₂(z))/2. So:

I’(a) = ∫₀¹ x² arccos x [ (J₀(a x) - J₂(a x))/2 ] dx.

This seems to lead to more complex integrals. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the orthogonality of Bessel functions. But the interval here is from 0 to1, and the weight function might not align.

Alternatively, look up tables of integrals involving Bessel functions and arccos. Gradshteyn and Ryzhik might have such integrals. Let me recall some standard integrals.

In Gradshteyn-Ryzhik, 6.733, there are integrals of x^m J_n(a x) with inverse trigonometric functions. Let me check:

In section 6.73, integrals involving trigonometric functions and Bessel functions. For example, 6.733.1: ∫₀¹ x^{ν+1} (1 - x²)^{μ -1} arcsin x dx. Not exactly our case, but similar.

Alternatively, 6.782, which includes integrals of x^m arccos x J_v(a x). Not sure. If I don't have access to the book, this is hard. But perhaps there's an integral formula that can be applied.

Alternatively, consider expanding arccos x into a series. The Taylor series for arccos x around x=0 is π/2 - x - (x^3)/6 - (3x^5)/40 - ... But integrating term by term multiplied by J₁(2x) might be possible due to convergence issues. Alternatively, use the integral expression for arccos x.

Alternatively, use integration by parts again. Let’s try:

Let’s set u = arccos x, dv = x J₁(2x) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ x J₁(2x) dx. As before, but we need to compute v.

As earlier, ∫ x J₁(2x) dx. Let’s set z = 2x, so x = z/2, dx = dz/2. Then ∫ x J₁(z) (dz/2) = (1/4) ∫ z J₁(z) dz. As before, ∫ z J₁(z) dz = -z J₀(z) + ∫ J₀(z) dz. So v = (1/4)[ -z J₀(z) + ∫ J₀(z) dz ] + C. Evaluated from 0 to 2x. So:

v = (1/4)[ -2x J₀(2x) + ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ].

Therefore, integration by parts gives:

uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du.

At x=1: u=0, so uv term is 0. At x=0: arccos 0 = π/2, and v(0) = (1/4)[0 + ∫₀^0 ... ] =0. So the boundary term is 0. Therefore, the integral I becomes:

- ∫₀¹ v du ] = - ∫₀¹ [ (1/4)( -2x J₀(2x) + ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ) ] * (-1/√(1 -x²)) dx.

Simplify the signs:

= - ∫₀¹ [ (1/4)( -2x J₀(2x) + ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ) ] * (-1/√(1 -x²)) dx

= - (1/4) ∫₀¹ [ -2x J₀(2x) + ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] * (-1/√(1 -x²)) dx

= - (1/4) ∫₀¹ [ -2x J₀(2x) + ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] * (-1/√(1 -x²)) dx

Multiply the negatives:

= - (1/4) ∫₀¹ [2x J₀(2x) - ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] / √(1 -x²) dx

= - (1/4) [ 2 ∫₀¹ x J₀(2x) / √(1 -x²) dx - ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] / √(1 -x²) dx ]

This results in two integrals. Let's denote them as I1 and I2:

I = - (1/4)(2 I1 - I2)

Where I1 = ∫₀¹ x J₀(2x) / √(1 -x²) dx

I2 = ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] / √(1 -x²) dx

Let's tackle I1 first. For I1, we can substitute x = sinθ, so dx = cosθ dθ, and √(1 -x²) = cosθ. Then x from 0 to1 becomes θ from 0 to π/2. So:

I1 = ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ) J₀(2 sinθ) / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ J₀(2 sinθ) dθ.

This integral might be expressible in terms of known functions. Let's recall that J₀(z) has a series expansion: J₀(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k!)^2 ) (z/2)^{2k} ].

Substituting z = 2 sinθ:

J₀(2 sinθ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k!)^2 ) (sinθ)^{2k} ]

Therefore, I1 becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k!)^2 ) ] ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ (sinθ)^{2k} dθ = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k!)^2 ) ] ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ.

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1) / Γ(k + 3/2) ). Using the formula for the beta function again. This is equal to (sqrt(π)/2) * (k! ) / ( (2k +1)!! / 2^k ) ) = (sqrt(π)/2) * (2^k k! ) / ( (2k +1)!! ) )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...3*1 = (2k +1)! ) / (2^k k! )

Therefore, the integral becomes (sqrt(π)/2) * (2^k k! ) / ( (2k +1)! ) / (2^k k! ) ) = sqrt(π)/2 * 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / ( (2k +1)! ) )

Wait, perhaps I need to recheck. Let me compute ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ:

Using the formula:

∫₀^{π/2} sin^{n}θ dθ = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ( (n+1)/2 ) / Γ( (n/2) +1 )

For n =2k +1:

= (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k +1) / Γ(k + 3/2 )

Γ(k +1) =k! and Γ(k +3/2) = (k +1/2) Γ(k +1/2) = (k +1/2)(k -1/2)...(1/2) sqrt(π)

Alternatively, Γ(k +3/2) = (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(sqrt(π)/2) * k! / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π)/2^{k +1} ) ] = (sqrt(π)/2) * k! * 2^{k +1} / [ (2k +1)!! sqrt(π) ) ]

Simplify:

= (1/2) * k! * 2^{k +1} / (2k +1)!! )

= (2^{k} k! ) / (2k +1)!! )

But (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)(2k -1)...3*1 = (2k +1)! ) / (2^k k! )

Therefore, substituting back:

= (2^{k} k! ) / [ (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ] = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Therefore, I1 becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) ] * [ 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k} / (2k +1)! ) ]

This series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k}) / (2k +1)! ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (4^k) / (2k +1)! ) ]

Recognize this series as related to the sine function. Recall that sin x = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k x^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! ) ]

If we set x =2, then sin 2 = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! ) ]

Therefore, our series is (1/2) sin 2, since:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / (2k +1)! ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k}) / (2k +1)! ) ] = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k +1}) / (2k +1)! ) ] = (1/2) sin 2.

Therefore, I1 = (1/2) sin 2.

Now, moving to I2 = ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^{2x} J₀(z) dz ] / √(1 -x²) dx.

This seems more challenging. Let's swap the order of integration. The inner integral is over z from 0 to 2x, and x from z/2 to1. So:

I2 = ∫₀² J₀(z) [ ∫_{z/2}^1 1/√(1 -x²) dx ] dz.

Because for a fixed z, x ranges from z/2 to1. So:

I2 = ∫₀² J₀(z) [ ∫_{z/2}^1 1/√(1 -x²) dx ] dz.

Compute the inner integral ∫_{a}^1 1/√(1 -x²) dx = arcsin x |_{a}^1 = π/2 - arcsin a.

So:

I2 = ∫₀² J₀(z) [ π/2 - arcsin(z/2) ] dz.

Therefore, I2 = (π/2) ∫₀² J₀(z) dz - ∫₀² J₀(z) arcsin(z/2) dz.

The first integral, ∫₀² J₀(z) dz, is known. From the integral of J₀(z), which is z J₁(z) + ... Wait, no. As before, ∫ J₀(z) dz = (π/2) [H₀(z) J₁(z) - H₁(z) J₀(z)] + C. But evaluating from 0 to2. However, at z=0, H₀(0) =0 and J₁(0)=0, so the lower limit is 0. Therefore:

∫₀² J₀(z) dz = (π/2) [H₀(2) J₁(2) - H₁(2) J₀(2) ].

But this involves Struve functions, which might not be helpful for an analytical solution. The second integral ∫₀² J₀(z) arcsin(z/2) dz is even more complicated. This suggests that this approach might not lead to a closed-form expression.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the integral, perhaps the original series approach is the way to go, even if it results in a hypergeometric function. Let's return to the series expression for I:

I = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ]

Let's try to write this series in terms of hypergeometric functions. The general term is:

a_k = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3) (2k +3)! ) ]

Let's express this in terms of factorials and powers. Let's note that (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)!.

So:

a_k = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

Let's write (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)(2k -1)!...1. Not sure. Let's express (2k +1)! = (2k +1)!.

Alternatively, express in terms of (k +1)! and other terms. Let's note that (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)!.

So:

a_k = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +2)(2k +1)! ) ]

Let's factor out 2 from (2k +2) and (2k +3):

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 * 2(k +1) * (2k +1)! ) ]

Cancel (k +1) terms:

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 * 2 * (2k +1)! ) ]

= [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +1} ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +1)! ) ]

Now, let's write (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)(2k -1)...1. But perhaps express in terms of factorials:

(2k +1)! = (2k +1)! = product_{i=1}^{2k +1} i.

But I don't see a straightforward simplification. Let's consider writing the term as:

a_k = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +1} ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +1)! ) ]

Let's express this as:

a_k = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +1} ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +1)! ) ] = [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +1} ] / [ (2k +3)^2 k! (2k +1)! ) ]

This resembles terms of a hypergeometric function, but the denominator has (2k +1)! and (2k +3)^2, which complicates things. Perhaps this can be expressed using the generalized hypergeometric function _pF_q, but identifying the parameters would be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the series can be summed numerically. Given that the original integral is from 0 to1, and the Bessel function is well-behaved, maybe the series converges quickly. Let's compute the first few terms and see.

Let's compute the terms for k=0,1,2,... and sum them up until convergence.

For k=0:

a_0 = [ (-1)^0 2^{1} ] / [ 0! (3)^2 (1)! ) ] = 2 / (1 *9 *1) = 2/9 ≈0.2222222222

k=1:

a_1 = [ (-1)^1 2^{3} ] / [ 1! (5)^2 (3)! ) ] = (-8) / (1 *25 *6) = -8/150 ≈-0.0533333333

k=2:

a_2 = [ (-1)^2 2^{5} ] / [ 2! (7)^2 (5)! ) ] = 32 / (2 *49 *120) = 32/(11760) ≈0.0027210884

k=3:

a_3 = [ (-1)^3 2^{7} ] / [ 6 (9)^2 (7)! ) ] = -128) / (6 *81 *5040) = -128/(6*81*5040) = -128/(2449440) ≈-0.00005225

k=4:

a_4 = [ (-1)^4 2^{9} ] / [ 24 (11)^2 (9)! ) ] = 512 / (24 *121 *362880) = 512/(24*121*362880) ≈512/(1,058,296,320) ≈0.000000483

So the terms are decreasing rapidly. Summing the first few terms:

k=0: 0.2222222222

k=1: 0.2222222222 -0.0533333333 = 0.1688888889

k=2: +0.0027210884 → 0.1716099773

k=3: -0.00005225 → 0.1715577273

k=4: +0.000000483 → ~0.1715582103

Higher terms will contribute negligibly. So the sum is approximately 0.1715582103. But wait, this is the series for I, which is the original integral. But wait, no: recall that I = Σ a_k, where a_k is the term we computed. But according to the previous steps, the original integral I is equal to this series. So the numerical value is approximately 0.1715582103. Let's check with numerical integration.

Alternatively, to verify, let's compute the integral numerically. Using a calculator or software, but since I don't have access, I'll proceed with the series approximation. The sum up to k=4 gives ~0.1715582103. Let's round this to 0.1715582103. But let's check if higher terms contribute. For k=5:

a_5 = [ (-1)^5 2^{11} ] / [ 120 (13)^2 (11)! ) ] = -2048 / (120 *169 *39916800) ≈ negligible, on the order of 1e-9. So the series converges to approximately 0.1715582103.

But let's cross-validate. Let's compute the numerical integral using another approach. The integral is ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx. Let's approximate this using substitution x = sinθ, then dx = cosθ dθ. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ arccos(sinθ) J₁(2 sinθ) cosθ dθ. But arccos(sinθ) = π/2 - θ. So:

∫₀^{π/2} sinθ (π/2 - θ) J₁(2 sinθ) cosθ dθ.

This might be easier to approximate numerically. However, without computational tools, it's challenging. But given the series approximation gives around 0.1715582103, which is approximately 0.1715582103. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this would be 0.1715582103. But let's check if the exact answer can be expressed in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is (π/8) [J_0(2) - J_2(2)] or something similar, but I need to verify.

Alternatively, recall that earlier when we integrated by parts, we had:

I = - (1/4)(2 I1 - I2) = - (1/4)(2*(1/2 sin 2) - I2) = - (1/4)(sin 2 - I2). But I2 is complicated. However, if we can express I2 in terms of known functions, perhaps we can find a closed-form.

But given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the most feasible approach is to accept that the integral can be expressed as a hypergeometric function and provide the series form as the exact answer, along with the numerical approximation from the series.

But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. Given that the series converges and can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, perhaps the exact answer is:

I = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k 2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)}{k! (2k + 3)^2 (2k + 3)!}

But this is quite complicated. Alternatively, recognizing that the series resembles a hypergeometric function, but I need to identify the parameters.

Alternatively, using the series we derived earlier:

I = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +3)! ) ]

This can be written as:

I = 4 Σ_{k=0}^∞ \frac{(-4)^k (k + 1)}{k! (2k + 3)^2 (2k + 3)!}

But I don't recognize this as a standard special function. Therefore, the exact answer is this infinite series. However, the problem asks for the exact answer, which might be expressible in terms of known constants or functions. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might need to conclude that the exact answer is best expressed as this series, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution I missed.

Alternatively, let's recall that the original integral is ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx. Let's try substitution t = arccos x. Then x = cos t, dx = -sin t dt. When x=0, t=π/2; x=1, t=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{π/2}^0 cos t * t * J₁(2 cos t) (-sin t) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} t cos t sin t J₁(2 cos t) dt.

This might not help, but perhaps using integral tables. Alternatively, using the identity for products of Bessel functions and trigonometric functions. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of a clear analytical path, I think the best approach is to present the series as the exact answer and provide the numerical approximation obtained from the series summation.

Therefore, the exact answer is the infinite series:

I = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k 2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)}{k! (2k + 3)^2 (2k + 3)!}

And the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1715582103.

But the problem might expect a closed-form answer. Let me check once more. Suppose we consider the integral I = ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx. If we use integration by parts where I = - (1/4)(2 I1 - I2), and we found I1 = (1/2) sin 2. Then I = - (1/4)(sin 2 - I2). If we can express I2 in terms of known functions, perhaps I can find a closed-form.

But I2 = ∫₀² J₀(z) [π/2 - arcsin(z/2)] dz. Let's split this into two parts:

I2 = (π/2) ∫₀² J₀(z) dz - ∫₀² J₀(z) arcsin(z/2) dz.

The first integral, ∫₀² J₀(z) dz, can be expressed using Struve functions as mentioned before. The second integral is more complicated. However, if we can express arcsin(z/2) as a series, perhaps we can integrate term by term.

The Taylor series for arcsin(w) around w=0 is Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1) ) ) w^{2n +1} ] for |w| ≤1. Here, w = z/2, so arcsin(z/2) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1) ) ) (z/2)^{2n +1} ] for |z| ≤2.

Therefore, the second integral becomes:

∫₀² J₀(z) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1) ) ) (z/2)^{2n +1} ] dz.

Swap the sum and integral:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1) 2^{2n +1} ) ) ] ∫₀² J₀(z) z^{2n +1} dz.

Simplify the coefficients:

(2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n +1) 2^{2n +1} ) ) = (2n)! / ( (4^n * 2^{2n +1}) (n!)^2 (2n +1) ) ) = (2n)! / ( 2^{4n +1} (n!)^2 (2n +1) ) )

But 4^n = 2^{2n}, so 4^n * 2^{2n +1} = 2^{4n +1}.

The integral ∫₀² J₀(z) z^{2n +1} dz. Let's use the identity ∫₀^a J_ν(z) z^{ν +1} dz = a^{ν +1} J_{ν +1}(a). But here, ν=0, and the exponent is 2n +1. So ν +1 =1, but the exponent is 2n +1. Not directly applicable. However, there's a general formula:

∫ z^{μ} J_ν(z) dz = z^{μ} J_{ν +1}(z) - (μ - ν -1) ∫ z^{μ -1} J_{ν +1}(z) dz.

But this might not help. Alternatively, use the series expansion of J₀(z) and integrate term by term.

J₀(z) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 ) (z/2)^{2m} ]

So ∫₀² J₀(z) z^{2n +1} dz = Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 2^{2m} ) ] ∫₀² z^{2m +2n +1} dz.

The integral of z^{2m +2n +1} from 0 to2 is [2^{2m +2n +2} ] / (2m +2n +2) ) = 2^{2m +2n +2} / (2(m +n +1) ) = 2^{2m +2n +1} / (m +n +1).

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 2^{2m} ) ] * [2^{2m +2n +1} / (m +n +1) ) ] = 2^{2n +1} Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m 2^{2m} / (m!)^2 ) * 2^{2m} / (m +n +1) ) ]

Wait, no:

Wait, the term is [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 2^{2m} ) ] * [2^{2m +2n +1} / (m +n +1) ) ] = [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 ) ] * [2^{2m +2n +1} / 2^{2m} ) ] * [1 / (m +n +1) ) ]

= [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 ) ] * [2^{2n +1} ] * [1 / (m +n +1) ) ]

= 2^{2n +1} Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m / (m!)^2 (m +n +1) ) ]

This series doesn't seem to have a closed-form expression. Therefore, this approach also leads to a dead end.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress towards a closed-form solution, I think the problem might require recognizing the integral as a known result or using advanced technique beyond my current approach. However, given the problem's instruction to compute it analytically, I might have missed a key insight.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of J₁(2x) and swapping integrals. Let me try that again.

J₁(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ - θ) dθ.

Then the original integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x arccos x [ (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ - θ) dθ ] dx.

Swap the integrals:

(1/π) ∫₀^π [ ∫₀¹ x arccos x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx ] dθ.

Let's focus on the inner integral: ∫₀¹ x arccos x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx.

This seems complicated, but perhaps using integration by parts. Let’s set u = arccos x, dv = x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx.

But integrating x cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx is non-trivial. Let's make a substitution. Let’s set y = 2x sinθ - θ. Then dy/dx = 2 sinθ. So dx = dy/(2 sinθ). But this might not help. Alternatively, use integration by parts.

Let’s set s = x, dt = cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx. Then ds = dx, and t = ∫ cos(2x sinθ - θ) dx. Let’s compute t:

Let’s set u = 2x sinθ - θ. Then du/dx = 2 sinθ. So dx = du/(2 sinθ). Therefore, t = ∫ cos(u) du/(2 sinθ) ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(u) + C = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2x sinθ - θ) + C.

Therefore, integrating by parts:

sv |₀¹ - ∫ v ds = x * t |₀¹ - ∫ t dx.

At x=1: t = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ - θ). At x=0: t = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(-θ) = - (1/(2 sinθ)) sinθ = -1/2.

So the boundary term is [1 * (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ - θ) ] - [0 * (-1/2) ] = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ - θ).

The integral becomes:

(1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ - θ) - ∫₀¹ [ (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2x sinθ - θ) ] dx.

Therefore, the inner integral is:

(1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ - θ) - (1/(2 sinθ)) ∫₀¹ sin(2x sinθ - θ) dx.

Compute the integral ∫₀¹ sin(2x sinθ - θ) dx. Let’s set u = 2x sinθ - θ, du/dx = 2 sinθ, dx = du/(2 sinθ). When x=0, u = -θ; x=1, u=2 sinθ -θ.

So the integral becomes:

∫_{-θ}^{2 sinθ -θ} sin(u) * (du/(2 sinθ)) ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) [ -cos(u) ]_{-θ}^{2 sinθ -θ} = (1/(2 sinθ)) [ -cos(2 sinθ -θ) + cos(-θ) ].

Since cos(-θ) = cosθ, this becomes:

(1/(2 sinθ)) [ -cos(2 sinθ -θ) + cosθ ].

Therefore, the inner integral is:

(1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ -θ) - (1/(2 sinθ)) * (1/(2 sinθ)) [ -cos(2 sinθ -θ) + cosθ ]

= (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ -θ) + (1/(4 sin²θ)) [ cos(2 sinθ -θ) - cosθ ].

This expression is quite complex. Therefore, the original integral I becomes:

(1/π) ∫₀^π [ (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2 sinθ -θ) + (1/(4 sin²θ)) (cos(2 sinθ -θ) - cosθ) ] dθ.

This seems intractable analytically. Therefore, I must concede that despite multiple approaches, I cannot find a closed-form expression for this integral using elementary functions or standard special functions without resorting to infinite series or hypergeometric functions.

Given the problem's requirement to provide an exact answer, I will present the infinite series derived earlier as the exact analytical result and the numerical approximation obtained from summing the series up to k=4, which gives approximately 0.1715582103. However, to ensure accuracy, I should compute more terms or use numerical integration. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the series approximation.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact answer: The infinite series Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k +2} (k +1) ] / [ k! (2k +3)^2 (2k +3)! ) ]

Numerical approximation: Approximately 0.1715582103.

But the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX and the numerical approximation. Since the series is the exact answer, but it's possible that there's a closed-form expression I missed. Alternatively, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the series and the numerical value.
