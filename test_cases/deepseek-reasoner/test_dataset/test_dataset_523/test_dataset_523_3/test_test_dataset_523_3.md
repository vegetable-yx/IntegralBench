Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of 1/(e^x + 1) from 0 to infinity. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving exponentials sometimes can be solved by substitution or maybe using some known results. Let me think.

First, the function 1/(e^x + 1) looks similar to the Fermi-Dirac distribution or maybe related to the logistic function. But how to integrate it? Let me try substitution. Let's set u = e^x. Then du/dx = e^x, so du = e^x dx, which means dx = du/u. When x is 0, u is e^0 = 1, and as x approaches infinity, u approaches infinity. So substituting, the integral becomes the integral from u=1 to u=∞ of 1/(u + 1) * (du/u). Wait, that might not be straightforward. Let me check that substitution again.

Wait, original integral is ∫0^∞ 1/(e^x + 1) dx. Let me try substitution t = e^x. Then dt/dx = e^x, so dx = dt/t. When x=0, t=1; x→∞, t→∞. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ from t=1 to t=∞ of 1/(t + 1) * (dt/t). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another substitution?

Alternatively, maybe integrating 1/(e^x + 1). Let's manipulate the integrand. Let's write 1/(e^x + 1) as (e^{-x})/(1 + e^{-x}). Because if I multiply numerator and denominator by e^{-x}, I get e^{-x}/(1 + e^{-x}). Then, maybe that's easier to integrate. Let's check:

∫0^∞ [e^{-x}/(1 + e^{-x})] dx. Let me set u = 1 + e^{-x}. Then du/dx = -e^{-x}, so -du = e^{-x} dx. Then the integral becomes ∫ [ -du / u ]. The limits of integration: when x=0, u = 1 + e^0 = 2; when x→∞, e^{-x}→0, so u→1. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ from u=2 to u=1 of (-du/u) which is the same as ∫ from 1 to 2 of du/u. Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign. So ∫1^2 (1/u) du = ln(u) from 1 to 2 = ln(2) - ln(1) = ln(2) - 0 = ln(2). So the exact value is ln(2).

Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. Let's differentiate the antiderivative. If the integrand is e^{-x}/(1 + e^{-x}), then the antiderivative is -ln(1 + e^{-x}) + C. Let's check derivative: d/dx [-ln(1 + e^{-x})] = - [ (-e^{-x})/(1 + e^{-x}) ] = e^{-x}/(1 + e^{-x}) which matches the integrand. So evaluating from 0 to ∞:

At upper limit x→∞: -ln(1 + e^{-x}) approaches -ln(1 + 0) = -ln(1) = 0.

At lower limit x=0: -ln(1 + e^{0}) = -ln(2).

So the definite integral is 0 - (-ln(2)) = ln(2). Yep, that's correct. So the exact answer is ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931471806...

So the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places would be 0.6931471806. Let me check with a calculator. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931471805599453..., so rounding to 10 decimal places is 0.6931471806. That's correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is \ln 2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.6931471806.
