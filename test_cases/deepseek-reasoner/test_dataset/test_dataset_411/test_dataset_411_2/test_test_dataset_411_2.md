Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 2/π to infinity of sin(1/x) divided by x squared dx. Hmm. Alright, step by step.

First, the integral is ∫_{2/π}^∞ [sin(1/x)] / x² dx. Let me think about substitution. The integrand has sin(1/x) and 1/x², which makes me think that maybe substituting t = 1/x would simplify things. Because the derivative of 1/x is -1/x², which is present here. Let's try that.

Let t = 1/x. Then, dt/dx = -1/x², which means that dx = -x² dt. But since x = 1/t, substituting that in, dx = - (1/t²) dt. Wait, but the original integral is dx/x². Let me write that out.

Original integral: ∫ sin(1/x) / x² dx. Substitute t = 1/x, so x = 1/t. Then, dx = -1/t² dt. So substituting into the integral:

sin(t) / ( (1/t)² ) * (-1/t²) dt. Let's compute that. The denominator x² is (1/t)² = 1/t². So the integrand becomes sin(t) / (1/t²) * (1/x² dx). Wait, maybe I need to substitute everything properly.

Wait, let's redo the substitution step carefully. Let u = 1/x. Then, du = -1/x² dx. So, -du = dx/x². Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ sin(u) * (-du). But we need to adjust the limits of integration. When x approaches 2/π, u = 1/(2/π) = π/2. When x approaches infinity, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes from u = π/2 to u = 0. But since we have a negative sign from the substitution, we can reverse the limits and the negative cancels. So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin(u) du.

Oh, that's much simpler! So the integral simplifies to the integral of sin(u) from 0 to π/2. The integral of sin(u) is -cos(u) + C. Evaluating from 0 to π/2:

[-cos(π/2) + cos(0)] = -0 + 1 = 1. So the exact answer is 1.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. The substitution steps: when x is 2/π, u is π/2. When x approaches infinity, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{u=π/2}^{u=0} sin(u) * (-du) which is the same as ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin(u) du. Yes, that's correct. The integral of sin(u) is -cos(u), so evaluated from 0 to π/2: -cos(π/2) + cos(0) = -0 + 1 = 1. So the exact value is 1.

But wait, let me confirm with another method. Maybe integration by parts? Let's see. Let me try integrating sin(1/x)/x² dx. Let me set u = sin(1/x), dv = dx/x². Then du = cos(1/x) * (-1/x²) dx, and v = -1/x. So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du. So that's sin(1/x)*(-1/x) - ∫ (-1/x)*cos(1/x)*(-1/x²) dx. Wait, that seems more complicated. Let's compute:

uv = - sin(1/x)/x

Then, the integral part is - ∫ [ (-1/x) * cos(1/x) * (-1/x²) ] dx = - ∫ [ cos(1/x) / x³ ] dx. Hmm, that seems worse. So maybe integration by parts isn't the way to go. The substitution method was straightforward. So I was right the first time. The substitution t = 1/x simplifies the integral to ∫ sin(t) dt from 0 to π/2, which is 1. So exact answer is 1.

Now, the numerical approximation. Since the exact answer is 1, the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, if the integral is correct, then the numerical value is exactly 1. But let me verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the original integral numerically. Let's take x from 2/π to some large number, say N, and compute ∫_{2/π}^N sin(1/x)/x² dx. Then take N approaching infinity. Let's approximate it numerically.

But since we know analytically that the integral is 1, but just to confirm. Let's compute for example, with substitution t = 1/x, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin(t) dt, which is 1. So the numerical value is exactly 1. So the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. But maybe the problem expects a decimal even if it's an integer. So 1.0000000000.

Wait, perhaps I should check with a calculator. Let's compute the integral from x = 2/π to x = 1000 (a large number) of sin(1/x)/x² dx. Let's approximate this numerically. Let me compute the substitution again. If x is from 2/π to infinity, then t is from π/2 to 0. So the integral is ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin(t) dt. The integral of sin(t) from 0 to π/2 is 1 - cos(π/2) = 1 - 0 = 1. So yes, exact answer is 1. So numerical approximation is exactly 1. So rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 1.0000000000.

Therefore, the answer is {"answer": "1", "numerical_answer": "1.0000000000"}.
