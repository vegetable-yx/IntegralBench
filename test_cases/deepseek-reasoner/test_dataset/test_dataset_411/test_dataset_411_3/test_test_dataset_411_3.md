Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 2/π to infinity of sin(1/x) divided by x squared dx. Hmm, first, I should probably try to find an antiderivative for the integrand. The function is sin(1/x)/x². Let me think about substitution.

If I let u be 1/x, then du/dx would be -1/x². Oh, that's convenient because the integrand has a 1/x² term. So substituting u = 1/x, then du = -1/x² dx, which means that -du = 1/x² dx. That's perfect. So the integral becomes the integral of sin(u) times (-du). Let me check the limits. When x is 2/π, u would be 1/(2/π) = π/2. And as x approaches infinity, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes from u = π/2 to u = 0. But since the limits are flipped, the negative sign will reverse them back. So the integral is the integral from 0 to π/2 of sin(u) du. 

Wait, let me write that out step by step. Let u = 1/x, so when x = 2/π, u = π/2. When x approaches infinity, u approaches 0. Then, dx is -du/u², but let's see. Wait, du = -1/x² dx, so dx = -x² du. But since u = 1/x, x = 1/u, so dx = - (1/u²) du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ sin(u) / x² * dx. Hmm, substituting x in terms of u, x² is 1/u², so sin(u)/x² dx would be sin(u) * u² * (-1/u²) du. Wait, that's sin(u) * u²) * (-1/u²) du, which simplifies to -sin(u) du. But the limits are from x=2/π to x=∞, which translates to u=π/2 to u=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^0 -sin(u) du. The negative sign flips the limits, so it's ∫_0^{π/2} sin(u) du. 

Yes, that makes sense. The integral of sin(u) from 0 to π/2 is straightforward. The antiderivative of sin(u) is -cos(u). So evaluating from 0 to π/2 gives -cos(π/2) - (-cos(0)) = -0 - (-1) = 1. So the exact value of the integral is 1. 

Wait, let me verify that. Let's compute the integral step by step. The substitution part: 

Original integral: ∫_{2/π}^∞ [sin(1/x)/x²] dx

Let u = 1/x, so du = -1/x² dx ⇒ -du = 1/x² dx

When x = 2/π, u = π/2. When x → ∞, u → 0.

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫_{u=π/2}^{u=0} sin(u) * (-du) = ∫_{0}^{π/2} sin(u) du

Yes, that's correct. Then ∫ sin(u) du from 0 to π/2 is [-cos(u)] from 0 to π/2 = (-cos(π/2) + cos(0)) = (-0 + 1) = 1. So the exact answer is 1. 

Numerically, 1 is just 1.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If the integral is exactly 1, then the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. But let me confirm the substitution again. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check with another substitution. Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = sin(1/x), dv = 1/x² dx. Then du = -cos(1/x) * (-1/x²) dx? Wait, no. Wait, derivative of sin(1/x) is cos(1/x) * (-1/x²). So du = -cos(1/x)/x² dx. And dv = 1/x² dx, so v = -1/x. Then integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du. So that would be sin(1/x)*(-1/x) evaluated from 2/π to infinity minus ∫ (-1/x)*(-cos(1/x)/x²) dx. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Let's compute the first term: [ -sin(1/x)/x ] from 2/π to ∞. As x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so sin(1/x) ≈ 1/x, so -sin(1/x)/x ≈ -1/x², which tends to 0. At x=2/π, the term is -sin(π/2)/(2/π) = -1/(2/π) = -π/2. So the first term is 0 - (-π/2) = π/2. Then the remaining integral is ∫ (1/x) * cos(1/x)/x² dx = ∫ cos(1/x)/x³ dx. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. So perhaps the substitution method is better. 

But according to substitution, the integral is 1. Let me check with a numerical approximation. If the exact answer is 1, then numerically it's 1.0000000000. But maybe compute the integral numerically to check. Let's approximate the integral from 2/π to some large number, say N, and see if it approaches 1. 

Alternatively, let's compute the integral ∫_{2/π}^∞ sin(1/x)/x² dx. Let's make substitution again. If u = 1/x, then the integral becomes ∫_0^{π/2} sin(u) du = 1. So that's correct. Therefore, the exact answer is 1, and the approximation is 1.0000000000. 

Wait, but let me check with a concrete example. Suppose I compute the integral from x = 2/π to x = 1000. Let's approximate numerically. The integral is ∫_{2/π}^{1000} sin(1/x)/x² dx. Let's use substitution u=1/x, so it's ∫_{π/2}^{0.001} sin(u) du. Which is ∫_{0.001}^{π/2} sin(u) du = cos(0.001) - cos(π/2) = cos(0.001) - 0. The value of cos(0.001) is approximately 0.9999998333, so the integral from 0.001 to π/2 is approximately 0.9999998333. Then the remaining part from 1000 to infinity would be ∫_{1000}^∞ sin(1/x)/x² dx = ∫_{0}^{0.001} sin(u) du ≈ ∫_0^{0.001} u du = [0.5 u²]_0^{0.001} = 0.5*(0.000001) = 0.0000005. So total integral would be approximately 0.9999998333 + 0.0000005 ≈ 0.9999993333, which is close to 1. So that's consistent with the exact answer being 1. Therefore, the exact answer is 1, and the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. 

So the final answer should be {"answer": "1", "numerical_answer": "1.0000000000"}.
