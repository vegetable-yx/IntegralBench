Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1/2) cosh(1 * sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the integral. The integrand has x to the power of -1/2 and (2 - x) to the -1/2, multiplied by the hyperbolic cosine of the square root of x(2 - x). 

First, maybe I can simplify the expression or find a substitution that makes the integral more manageable. The terms x^(-1/2) and (2 - x)^(-1/2) look like parts of a Beta function or something related to a substitution that would lead to a Beta function integral. The Beta function is usually in the form ∫₀¹ t^{c-1}(1 - t)^{d-1} dt, which is B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). But here, the limits are from 0 to 2, so maybe a substitution can adjust the interval.

Also, the presence of cosh might complicate things. Wait, hyperbolic functions can sometimes be expressed in terms of exponentials, but maybe there's a substitution that can combine the terms. Let me think.

Let me first consider the substitution to make the integral from 0 to 1. Let me try a substitution to make the interval [0, 2] into [0, 1] or something. Let me set t = x/2. Then x = 2t, dx = 2dt. Then the limits when x=0, t=0; x=2, t=1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (2t)^(-1/2) (2 - 2t)^(-1/2) ) * cosh( sqrt(2t * (2 - 2t)) ) * 2 dt.

Simplify each part:

(2t)^(-1/2) = (2)^(-1/2) t^(-1/2)

(2 - 2t)^(-1/2) = (2(1 - t))^(-1/2) = 2^(-1/2) (1 - t)^(-1/2)

Multiply those together: 2^(-1/2) * 2^(-1/2) = 2^(-1) = 1/2. Then t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2). So the integrand becomes (1/2) * t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2) * cosh( sqrt(2t*(2 - 2t)) ) * 2 dt. The 2 from dx and the 1/2 from the previous terms would multiply to 1. So the integral simplifies to ∫₀¹ t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2) cosh( sqrt(2t(1 - t)*4) ) dt? Wait, let me check the argument of the cosh.

Original argument was sqrt(x(2 - x)). Substituting x = 2t, that becomes sqrt(2t*(2 - 2t)) = sqrt(4t(1 - t)) = 2 sqrt(t(1 - t)). So inside the cosh, we have 1 * 2 sqrt(t(1 - t)) = 2 sqrt(t(1 - t)). Wait, but the original problem says cosh(1 * sqrt(x(2 - x))). So substituting, it's cosh(2 sqrt(t(1 - t))). So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2) cosh(2 sqrt(t(1 - t))) dt.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, the integrand is t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2) cosh(2 sqrt(t(1 - t))). Let me see if there's a substitution that can help here. Maybe set u = sqrt(t(1 - t)), but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me think about the form of the integrand. The t^(-1/2)(1 - t)^(-1/2) is the same as 1 / sqrt(t(1 - t)), which is the same as 1 / sqrt(t - t²). So the integrand is [1 / sqrt(t - t²)] * cosh(2 sqrt(t - t²)) dt. Hmm, maybe substituting s = sqrt(t - t²). Let's try that.

Let s = sqrt(t - t²). Then s² = t - t². Let's compute dt in terms of ds. Differentiating both sides: 2s ds = (1 - 2t) dt. Hmm, but solving for dt would give dt = 2s ds / (1 - 2t). But t is related to s via s² = t - t². Let's solve for t. s² = t(1 - t). So t² - t + s² = 0. Quadratic equation: t = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4s²)] / 2. Hmm, this might complicate things. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps use a trigonometric substitution. Let me set t = sin²θ. Then dt = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(t(1 - t)) = sqrt(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ. Let's see. Then, substituting t = sin²θ, when t=0, θ=0; t=1, θ=π/2. The integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [ (sin²θ)^(-1/2) (1 - sin²θ)^(-1/2) ) * cosh(2 sinθ cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ ]

Simplify each part:

(sin²θ)^(-1/2) = 1/sinθ

(1 - sin²θ)^(-1/2) = 1/cosθ

Multiply those: 1/(sinθ cosθ)

Then, multiplied by 2 sinθ cosθ dθ: 1/(sinθ cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ = 2 dθ

So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} 2 * cosh(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ

But 2 sinθ cosθ is sin(2θ), so cosh(sin(2θ))? Wait, no. Wait, 2 sinθ cosθ is sin(2θ), but here the argument is 2 * sinθ cosθ, which is sin(2θ). So cosh(sin(2θ)). So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} cosh(sin(2θ)) dθ.

Hmm, that's a simpler integral. Let me check substitution again. Let me set φ = 2θ. Then when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. Then dφ = 2 dθ, so dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes 2 * ∫₀^π cosh(sinφ) * (dφ/2) = ∫₀^π cosh(sinφ) dφ.

So now the integral is ∫₀^π cosh(sinφ) dφ. Hmm, that's a known integral. Wait, I recall that ∫₀^π cosh(a sinφ) dφ = π I_0(a), where I_0 is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. Let me verify that. 

Yes, the integral ∫₀^π cosh(a sinφ) dφ is indeed equal to π I₀(a). For example, from standard integral tables or properties of Bessel functions. So in this case, a = 1, so the integral becomes π I₀(1). Therefore, the original integral is π I₀(1).

Wait, let me confirm this. The modified Bessel function of the first kind I_0(z) has an integral representation: I_0(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{z cosφ} dφ. But here we have cosh(sinφ). Hmm, maybe I need to check again. Wait, cosh(a sinφ) can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions. Let me recall that ∫₀^π cosh(a sinφ) dφ = π I_0(a). Let me check with a=1. If that's the case, then our integral is π I_0(1). 

Alternatively, perhaps using series expansion. Let's expand cosh(sinφ) as a series. cosh(sinφ) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (sin^{2n}φ)/(2n)!). Then integrating term by term: ∫₀^π cosh(sinφ) dφ = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [1/(2n)!)] ∫₀^π sin^{2n}φ dφ. The integral ∫₀^π sin^{2n}φ dφ is (π (2n)! )/(2^{2n} (n!)^2)). So substituting, the sum becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ [1/(2n)!)] * π (2n)! / (2^{2n} (n!)^2) ) = π Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(2^{2n} (n!)^2). But this series is exactly the series representation of I_0(1). Because I_0(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z^{2k})/(2^{2k} (k!)^2). So when z=1, I_0(1) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2^{2k} (k!)^2). Therefore, the integral is π I_0(1). So that's correct.

Therefore, the original integral is π I_0(1). So the exact answer is π times the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero evaluated at 1. 

Now, the problem says to compute the integral analytically. But is there a way to express I_0(1) in terms of elementary functions? I don't think so. The modified Bessel functions are special functions and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, the exact answer is π I_0(1). 

So step-by-step:

1. Substituted x = 2t, transformed the integral to ∫₀¹ t^{-1/2}(1 - t)^{-1/2} cosh(2 sqrt(t(1 - t))) dt.
2. Then used substitution t = sin²θ, leading to ∫₀^{π/2} 2 cosh(sin(2θ)) dθ.
3. Changed variable to φ = 2θ, resulting in ∫₀^π cosh(sinφ) dφ.
4. Recognized the integral as π I_0(1) using known integral representations of modified Bessel functions.

Therefore, the exact answer is π I_0(1). 

For the numerical approximation, we need to compute π multiplied by the value of I_0(1). The modified Bessel function I_0(1) can be evaluated numerically. From tables or computational tools, I_0(1) ≈ 1.266065878. Therefore, multiplying by π (≈3.1415926536), we get:

π * 1.266065878 ≈ 3.9774632606. 

Let me verify this with a calculator. Let's compute I_0(1):

The series for I_0(z) is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z^{2k})/(2^{2k} (k!)^2). For z=1:

I_0(1) = 1 + 1/(2^2 (1!)^2) + 1/(2^4 (2!)^2) + 1/(2^6 (3!)^2) + ... 

Calculating terms:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: 1/(4*1) = 0.25

Term 2: 1/(16*4) = 1/64 ≈0.015625

Term 3: 1/(64*36) ≈0.000434027778

Term 4: 1/(256*576) ≈0.00000678168

Term 5: 1/(1024*14400) ≈6.78168e-8

Adding these up:

1 + 0.25 = 1.25

+0.015625 = 1.265625

+0.000434027778 ≈1.26605902778

+0.00000678168 ≈1.26606580946

Then higher terms contribute negligibly. So I_0(1) ≈1.266065809, which rounds to 1.266065878 when considering more terms. So multiplying by π:

1.266065878 * 3.1415926535 ≈

Let me compute:

1.266065878 * 3 = 3.798197634

1.266065878 * 0.1415926535 ≈0.1792656 (approx)

Adding together: 3.798197634 + 0.1792656 ≈3.977463234. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 3.9774632606? Wait, maybe more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a more accurate value of I_0(1). Let me check online or use a calculator. 

According to Wolfram Alpha, I_0(1) ≈1.2660658777520084. So π * 1.2660658777520084 ≈3.9774632606. So the numerical value is approximately 3.9774632606. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 3.9774632606, which would be 3.9774632606. So 3.9774632606.

Therefore, the exact answer is π I_0(1), and the numerical approximation is approximately 3.9774632606.
