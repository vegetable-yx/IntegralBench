Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of ln(x)/(x² + 3) from 1 to 3. Hmm, let's see. I remember that integrals involving logarithms and rational functions can sometimes be tricky. Maybe substitution or integration by parts? Let me think.

First, let me write down the integral again: ∫₁³ [ln(x)/(x² + 3)] dx. Hmm. The denominator is x² + 3, which is a quadratic. Maybe substitution? If I let u = x² + 3, then du/dx = 2x, but the numerator is ln(x), not x. That might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe integration by parts. The formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me choose u and dv. Let's set u = ln(x), so du = (1/x) dx. Then dv would be 1/(x² + 3) dx. Then v would be the integral of dv, which is (1/√3) arctan(x/√3) right? Because ∫1/(x² + a²) dx = (1/a) arctan(x/a) + C. So here a is √3. So v = (1/√3) arctan(x/√3).

So applying integration by parts: uv - ∫v du. That would be ln(x)*(1/√3) arctan(x/√3) evaluated from 1 to 3 minus ∫₁³ (1/√3) arctan(x/√3)*(1/x) dx. Hmm, so now the integral becomes (1/√3) ∫ [arctan(x/√3)/x] dx. That seems more complicated. Maybe this isn't helpful. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's another substitution. Let me think. If I let t = x/√3, so x = t√3, dx = √3 dt. Then the integral becomes ∫ [ln(t√3) / ( (t√3)^2 + 3 ) ] * √3 dt. Let's compute that. The denominator is 3t² + 3 = 3(t² + 1). So the integral becomes √3 ∫ [ln(t√3)] / [3(t² + 1)] dt. Simplify that: √3/3 ∫ [ln(t) + ln(√3)] / (t² + 1) dt. Which is (1/√3) [ ∫ ln(t)/(t² + 1) dt + ln(√3) ∫ 1/(t² + 1) dt ].

Hmm, the integral of 1/(t² +1) dt is arctan(t) + C. And the integral of ln(t)/(t² +1) dt... I'm not sure. Maybe another integration by parts here? Let me set u = ln(t), dv = dt/(t² +1). Then du = (1/t) dt, and v = arctan(t). So integration by parts gives uv - ∫v du = ln(t) arctan(t) - ∫ arctan(t)/t dt. But now we have ∫ arctan(t)/t dt, which is another integral that might not be straightforward. Hmm, this seems like a loop. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe consider substitution for the original integral. Let me think about substitution y = 1/x. Sometimes reciprocal substitution helps. Let me try that. Let y = 1/x, so when x=1, y=1; x=3, y=1/3. Then dx = -1/y² dy. The integral becomes ∫ from 1 to 1/3 of ln(1/y)/( (1/y²) + 3 ) * (-1/y²) dy. Simplify the negative sign by flipping the limits: ∫ from 1/3 to 1 of [ -ln(y) ] / ( (1 + 3y²)/y² ) * (1/y²) dy. Let's see: denominator (1/y² + 3) is (1 + 3y²)/y². So the expression becomes [ -ln(y) * y² / (1 + 3y²) ] * (1/y²) dy. The y² cancels out, so it's -ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy. So the integral becomes ∫ from 1/3 to 1 of -ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy. Which is the same as ∫ from 1 to 1/3 of ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy. Hmm, but I don't see how this helps. Maybe adding the original integral and this transformed one?

Let me denote the original integral as I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx. Then after substitution, we have another integral ∫_{1/3}^1 [ -ln(y) ] / (1 + 3y²) dy = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy. Changing variable back to x, but not sure. Wait, if I add I and this new integral, maybe something cancels?

Wait, let's write I as ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx. The transformed integral is ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy. Let me change variable in the transformed integral to x, where y = 1/x. Wait, but we already did that. Alternatively, maybe if I write the transformed integral as ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(1 + 3y²) dy = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Let me make substitution z = y, but not sure. Alternatively, let me consider adding I and the transformed integral. Let me see:

I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx

Transformed integral: J = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Let me reverse the limits of J to make it from 1/3 to 1, so J = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy = ∫₁^{1/3} ln(y)/(3y² +1) (-dy) = ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Wait, maybe not. Let me check:

Original substitution y = 1/x, so when x=1, y=1; x=3, y=1/3. So the transformed integral is from y=1/3 to y=1. So J = ∫_{1/3}^1 [ -ln(y) ] / (3y² +1) dy. So if I add I and J:

I + J = ∫₁³ [ln(x)/(x² +3)] dx + ∫_{1/3}^1 [ -ln(y)/(3y² +1) ] dy.

But maybe changing variables in J to x, where y = x. Wait, no. Alternatively, if I substitute in J, let me set z = y. Then J is ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(z)/(3z² +1) dz. If I let z = 1/t, then when z=1/3, t=3; z=1, t=1. Then dz = -1/t² dt. So J becomes ∫₃¹ -ln(1/t)/(3*(1/t²) +1) * (-1/t²) dt. Simplify: the two negatives cancel, so it's ∫₃¹ ln(1/t)/(3/t² +1) * (1/t²) dt. ln(1/t) is -ln(t). The denominator is (3 + t²)/t². So the integral becomes ∫₃¹ [ -ln(t) ] / ( (3 + t²)/t² ) * (1/t²) dt. Simplify: -ln(t) * t² / (3 + t²) * 1/t² = -ln(t)/(3 + t²). So the integral is ∫₃¹ -ln(t)/(3 + t²) dt. Changing the limits back to 1 to 3 by flipping the integral sign, it becomes ∫₁³ ln(t)/(3 + t²) dt. But that's the same as I. So J = ∫₁³ ln(t)/(t² +3) dt = I. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, when I did substitution z = 1/t in J, which was ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(z)/(3z² +1) dz. Then substituting z = 1/t, dz = -1/t² dt. So J becomes ∫_{t=3}^{t=1} -ln(1/t)/(3*(1/t²) +1) * (-1/t²) dt. The two negatives make a positive. So ∫₃¹ [ln(t)] / (3/t² +1) * (1/t²) dt. Then 3/t² +1 = (3 + t²)/t². So the integrand becomes ln(t) * t²/(3 + t²) * 1/t² = ln(t)/(3 + t²). So the integral is ∫₃¹ ln(t)/(3 + t²) dt. Changing the limits to 1³, we get -∫₁³ ln(t)/(t² +3) dt. So J = -I. Therefore, I + J = I - I = 0. Wait, that can't be. Wait, but according to substitution, J = -I. So I + J = 0? That would mean I = -J. But how?

Wait, let's recap. Original integral I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx. After substitution y = 1/x, we get J = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Then, by substituting z = 1/y, we found that J = -I. Therefore, I + J = I - I = 0. But that would imply I = -J, but J is an integral from 1/3 to 1, and I is from 1 to 3. So maybe this approach isn't helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me consider adding I and J. If I write I + J = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx + ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Let me make substitution in J: let y = 1/t, so when y=1/3, t=3; y=1, t=1. Then dy = -1/t² dt. So J becomes ∫₃¹ -ln(1/t)/(3*(1/t²) +1) * (-1/t²) dt. Which simplifies to ∫₃¹ ln(t)/(3 + t²) dt. So J = ∫₃¹ ln(t)/(3 + t²) dt. Then changing the limits, J = -∫₁³ ln(t)/(t² +3) dt = -I. Therefore, I + J = I - I = 0. So I = -J. But then, how does that help?

Wait, if I = -J, then I = - [ ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy ] = ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. So I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx = ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Hmm, but not sure how to use this. Maybe adding them?

Wait, let's consider I + I = 2I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx + ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. But I don't see a way to combine these. Alternatively, maybe changing variables in the second integral to t = 3y. Let me try that. Let t = 3y, so when y=1/3, t=1; y=1, t=3. Then dy = dt/3. So the second integral becomes ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(3*(t/3)^2 +1) * (dt/3). Simplify: denominator is 3*(t²/9) +1 = t²/3 +1 = (t² +3)/3. So the integrand is ln(t/3) / [ (t² +3)/3 ] * (1/3) = ln(t/3) * 3/(t² +3) * 1/3 = ln(t/3)/(t² +3). So the second integral becomes ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. Therefore, 2I = ∫₁³ [ ln(x)/(x² +3) + ln(x/3)/(x² +3) ] dx. Factor out 1/(x² +3): 2I = ∫₁³ [ ln(x) + ln(x/3) ] / (x² +3) dx. Combine the logarithms: ln(x) + ln(x/3) = ln(x) + ln(x) - ln(3) = 2 ln(x) - ln(3). So 2I = ∫₁³ [2 ln(x) - ln(3)] / (x² +3) dx. Then, 2I = 2 ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. But the first integral is just 2I, so 2I = 2I - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. Wait, that would imply 0 = - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx, which can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the substitution steps.

Wait, let's check. When I set 2I = I + I, but actually, the second integral was transformed into ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. So 2I = I + ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. Then, 2I - I = ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. So I = ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. But ln(t/3) = ln(t) - ln(3), so I = ∫₁³ [ln(t) - ln(3)]/(t² +3) dt = ∫₁³ ln(t)/(t² +3) dt - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(t² +3) dt. But the first term is I, so I = I - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(t² +3) dt. Therefore, 0 = - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(t² +3) dt. Which implies that ∫₁³ 1/(t² +3) dt = 0, which is impossible. So clearly, there's a mistake in the reasoning here. Maybe the step where I thought 2I = I + something is wrong. Let me retrace.

Wait, I had I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx. Then, after substitution, J = ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Then, by substitution z = 1/y, J becomes ∫₁³ ln(z)/(z² +3) dz, which is equal to I. Wait, no. Wait, when I did substitution z = 1/y in J, which was ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Let me redo that substitution carefully.

Let z = 1/y, so when y = 1/3, z = 3; y = 1, z = 1. Then dy = -1/z² dz. So J becomes ∫_{z=3}^{z=1} -ln(1/z)/(3*(1/z²) +1) * (-1/z²) dz. The first negative sign is from the original integral, and the second negative is from dy = -1/z² dz. So two negatives make a positive. So J = ∫₃¹ [ln(z)] / (3/z² +1) * (1/z²) dz. Simplify denominator: 3/z² +1 = (3 + z²)/z². So the integrand becomes ln(z) * z²/(3 + z²) * 1/z² = ln(z)/(3 + z²). So J = ∫₃¹ ln(z)/(3 + z²) dz. Changing the limits to 1³, we get J = -∫₁³ ln(z)/(z² +3) dz = -I. Therefore, J = -I. So I + J = I - I = 0. Therefore, I = -J. But J is ∫_{1/3}^1 -ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. So I = -J = ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. But how does this help?

Wait, maybe if I consider I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx and I = ∫_{1/3}^1 ln(y)/(3y² +1) dy. Let me make substitution in the second integral: let t = 3y. Then when y=1/3, t=1; y=1, t=3. dy = dt/3. So the integral becomes ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(3*(t/3)^2 +1) * (dt/3). Simplify denominator: 3*(t²/9) +1 = t²/3 +1 = (t² +3)/3. So the integrand is ln(t/3) * 3/(t² +3) * 1/3 = ln(t/3)/(t² +3). Therefore, I = ∫₁³ ln(t/3)/(t² +3) dt. So now, I have two expressions for I: the original and this one. So adding them together: I + I = ∫₁³ [ln(x)/(x² +3) + ln(x/3)/(x² +3)] dx. Which is 2I = ∫₁³ [ln(x) + ln(x/3)]/(x² +3) dx. As before, ln(x) + ln(x/3) = 2 ln(x) - ln(3). So 2I = ∫₁³ [2 ln(x) - ln(3)]/(x² +3) dx. Then, 2I = 2 ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. But the first integral is 2I, so 2I = 2I - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. Subtracting 2I from both sides gives 0 = - ln(3) ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. Which implies that ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumption that I = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx and I = ∫₁³ ln(x/3)/(x² +3) dx. But according to substitution, that's what we derived. But this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe this method isn't the right way to go. Let me try another approach. Let's go back to the original integral: ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx. Maybe consider expanding ln(x) as a series? Since the denominator is x² +3, which can be written as 3(1 + (x²)/3). So 1/(x² +3) = 1/(3(1 + (x²)/3)) = (1/3) * 1/(1 + (x²)/3). If |x²/3| < 1, which is true for x between 1 and 3, since x²/3 is 1/3 to 3. So for x=3, x²/3 = 3, which is 3, so the series would diverge there. So maybe not useful.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t = x². Let me try t = x², then dt = 2x dx. But the integral has ln(x) and x² +3. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: differentiation under the integral sign. Let me consider a parameter in the integral. Let me define I(a) = ∫₁³ ln(ax)/(x² +3) dx. Then, differentiating with respect to a might help. Let's see. dI/da = ∫₁³ (1/(ax)) * x/(x² +3) dx = ∫₁³ 1/(a(x² +3)) dx. Then, integrating dI/da = 1/a ∫₁³ 1/(x² +3) dx. The integral ∫1/(x² +3) dx is (1/√3) arctan(x/√3) + C. So dI/da = 1/a [ (1/√3)(arctan(3/√3) - arctan(1/√3)) ] = 1/a [ (1/√3)(arctan(√3) - arctan(1/√3)) ]. arctan(√3) is π/3, and arctan(1/√3) is π/6. So this becomes 1/a [ (1/√3)(π/3 - π/6) ] = 1/a [ (1/√3)(π/6) ] = π/(6√3 a). Then, integrating dI/da with respect to a: I(a) = π/(6√3) ln(a) + C. To find C, set a=1, since I(1) = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² +3) dx, which is our original integral. But when a=1, I(1) = π/(6√3) * 0 + C = C. But we need another condition to find C. Wait, but if we set a=1, then I(1) is the original integral, which is what we're trying to find. So this approach might not help unless we can find C. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right parameterization.

Alternatively, let me consider a different parameter. Let me set I(b) = ∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² + b) dx. Then, differentiate with respect to b. dI/db = -∫₁³ ln(x)/(x² + b)^2 dx. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, maybe consider integrating with respect to a parameter inside the logarithm. Let me think. Maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, let's go back to integration by parts. Let me try that again. Let u = ln(x), dv = dx/(x² +3). Then du = (1/x) dx, v = (1/√3) arctan(x/√3). So integration by parts gives:

I = uv |₁³ - ∫₁³ v du = [ln(x)/√3 arctan(x/√3)] from 1 to 3 - ∫₁³ (1/√3) arctan(x/√3) * (1/x) dx.

So I = (ln(3)/√3 arctan(3/√3) - ln(1)/√3 arctan(1/√3)) - (1/√3) ∫₁³ arctan(x/√3)/x dx.

Since ln(1) = 0, the first term simplifies to (ln(3)/√3)(π/3) because arctan(3/√3) = arctan(√3) = π/3. And arctan(1/√3) = π/6. So the first part is (ln(3)/√3)(π/3) - 0 = (π ln(3))/(3√3).

Now, the remaining integral is (1/√3) ∫₁³ arctan(x/√3)/x dx. Let me denote this integral as J. So J = ∫₁³ arctan(x/√3)/x dx.

Hmm, how to compute J. Let me make substitution t = x/√3. So x = t√3, dx = √3 dt. Then, when x=1, t=1/√3; x=3, t=3/√3 = √3. So J becomes ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} arctan(t√3/√3)/ (t√3) * √3 dt. Simplify: arctan(t) / (t√3) * √3 dt. The √3 cancels, so J = ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} arctan(t)/t dt.

So J = ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} arctan(t)/t dt. Hmm, this integral might be related to the dilogarithm function or something like that. Let me recall that ∫ arctan(t)/t dt can be expressed in terms of the dilogarithm. Let me check.

Let me recall that ∫ arctan(t)/t dt. Let me set u = arctan(t), dv = dt/t. Then du = 1/(1 + t²) dt, v = ln(t). So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = arctan(t) ln(t) - ∫ ln(t)/(1 + t²) dt. But this leads to another integral ∫ ln(t)/(1 + t²) dt, which is similar to the original problem. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, consider substitution s = t². Let s = t², ds = 2t dt. Not sure. Alternatively, expand arctan(t) as a series. For |t| ≤1, arctan(t) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n t^{2n+1}/(2n+1). But our limits are from 1/√3 to √3. Since 1/√3 ≈ 0.577 and √3 ≈ 1.732. So for t from 0.577 to 1.732, the series expansion around t=0 would not converge at t=√3. So that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, use the identity that ∫ arctan(t)/t dt = (1/2i) [ Li_2(it) - Li_2(-it) ] + C, where Li_2 is the dilogarithm function. But this is getting into special functions, which might not be helpful for an exact analytical solution. The problem says to compute the integral analytically, so maybe it's expected to express it in terms of dilogarithms?

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can relate J to the original integral I. Let me see. Let me consider J = ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} arctan(t)/t dt. Let me make substitution u = 1/t. Then when t = 1/√3, u = √3; t = √3, u = 1/√3. Then dt = -1/u² du. So J becomes ∫_{√3}^{1/√3} arctan(1/u)/ (1/u) * (-1/u²) du. Simplify: arctan(1/u) is π/2 - arctan(u) for u > 0. So J = ∫_{√3}^{1/√3} [π/2 - arctan(u)] * u * (-1/u²) du. The negative sign flips the limits: J = ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} [π/2 - arctan(u)] * u * (1/u²) du = ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} [π/2 - arctan(u)] / u du. Which is ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} π/(2u) du - ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} arctan(u)/u du. The first integral is π/2 ∫_{1/√3}^{√3} (1/u) du = π/2 [ln(u)]_{1/√3}^{√3} = π/2 [ln(√3) - ln(1/√3)] = π/2 [ (1/2) ln(3) - (-1/2) ln(3) ] = π/2 [ ln(3) ] = (π/2) ln(3). The second integral is J itself. So J = (π/2) ln(3) - J. Therefore, 2J = (π/2) ln(3) => J = (π/4) ln(3). 

Wait, that's a neat trick! By substituting u = 1/t, we expressed J in terms of itself and solved for J. So J = (π/4) ln(3). Therefore, going back to the original expression:

I = (π ln(3))/(3√3) - (1/√3) * J = (π ln(3))/(3√3) - (1/√3)*(π/4 ln(3)) = (π ln(3))/(3√3) - (π ln(3))/(4√3). To combine these terms, find a common denominator. The common denominator is 12√3. So:

First term: (π ln(3))/(3√3) = 4π ln(3)/(12√3)

Second term: (π ln(3))/(4√3) = 3π ln(3)/(12√3)

So I = (4π ln(3) - 3π ln(3))/(12√3) = π ln(3)/(12√3)

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is π ln(3)/(12√3). 

Now, let's verify this expression. Let's check the steps again to make sure. We did integration by parts, then substitution for J, then used the integral J in terms of itself. The key step was substituting u = 1/t in J, which led to an equation where J = (π/2) ln(3) - J, leading to J = (π/4) ln(3). Then substituting back into I gives the result. Seems correct.

Now, to compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute π ln(3)/(12√3). Let's compute each part:

π ≈ 3.1415926536

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122887

√3 ≈ 1.7320508076

So denominator: 12 * √3 ≈ 12 * 1.7320508076 ≈ 20.7846096912

Numerator: π * ln(3) ≈ 3.1415926536 * 1.0986122887 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 1.0986122887 ≈ Let's compute this:

3 * 1.0986 = 3.2958

0.1415926536 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.1415926536 * 1 = 0.1415926536; 0.1415926536 * 0.0986 ≈ 0.01396. So total ≈ 0.1415926536 + 0.01396 ≈ 0.15555. So total numerator ≈ 3.2958 + 0.15555 ≈ 3.45135. But more accurately:

Using calculator: 3.1415926536 * 1.0986122887 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 1 = 3.1415926536

3.1415926536 * 0.0986122887 ≈ 0.310062766

So total ≈ 3.1415926536 + 0.310062766 ≈ 3.4516554196

Then, divide by denominator ≈ 20.7846096912:

3.4516554196 / 20.7846096912 ≈ Let's compute:

20.7846 * 0.166 = 3.452 (since 0.166 * 20 = 3.32, 0.166 * 0.7846 ≈ 0.130, total ≈ 3.45). So approximately 0.166. But let's do more accurately:

3.4516554196 ÷ 20.7846096912 ≈ 0.16607. Let's check with calculator:

20.7846096912 * 0.16607 ≈ 20 * 0.16607 = 3.3214, 0.7846096912 * 0.16607 ≈ 0.1303, total ≈ 3.3214 + 0.1303 ≈ 3.4517, which matches the numerator. So the value is approximately 0.16607. Rounded to 10 decimal places, let's compute more precisely.

Using a calculator:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098

√3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772

Compute numerator: π * ln(3) ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 

Let's compute step by step:
