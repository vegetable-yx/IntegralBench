Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to infinity of x divided by (e^x minus 1) dx. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving exponentials in the denominator sometimes relate to the Riemann zeta function or maybe the gamma function. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I can expand the denominator as a series. Since 1/(e^x - 1) is a common term, I recall that it can be expressed using a geometric series expansion. Specifically, for e^x > 1, which is true for x > 0, the denominator e^x - 1 can be written as e^x(1 - e^{-x}), so 1/(e^x - 1) is e^{-x}/(1 - e^{-x}), which is a geometric series sum from n=1 to infinity of e^{-nx}. So, substituting that into the integral, the integrand becomes x times the sum from n=1 to infinity of e^{-nx}.

Therefore, the integral becomes the sum from n=1 to infinity of the integral from 0 to infinity of x e^{-nx} dx. Now, interchanging the sum and the integral, assuming uniform convergence, which I think is valid here because the series converges uniformly on [0, ∞). So, swapping them, we have sum_{n=1}^∞ ∫_0^∞ x e^{-nx} dx.

Now, let's compute the integral ∫_0^∞ x e^{-nx} dx. This looks like a standard gamma integral. The integral of x^k e^{-ax} dx from 0 to infinity is Γ(k+1)/a^{k+1}, where Γ is the gamma function. Here, k is 1 and a is n. So Γ(2) is 1! which is 1. Therefore, the integral becomes 1/n². So each term in the sum is 1/n².

Therefore, the original integral is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n². Wait, that's the Basel problem, which sums to π²/6. So the exact value of the integral is π²/6.

But let me verify this step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the substitution of the series expansion. The expansion of 1/(e^x -1) is indeed sum_{n=1}^∞ e^{-nx} for x > 0. Then integrating term by term. The integral of x e^{-nx} dx from 0 to infinity. Let me compute that again. Let me do integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = e^{-nx} dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/n e^{-nx}. So uv evaluated from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ v du. The uv term: as x approaches infinity, e^{-nx} goes to zero, so the term is 0. At x=0, the term is 0. So the integral becomes - ∫ (-1/n e^{-nx}) dx from 0 to ∞. That's 1/n ∫ e^{-nx} dx from 0 to ∞. The integral of e^{-nx} dx is 1/n, so the whole thing is 1/n * 1/n = 1/n². So yes, each term is 1/n², and the sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n² is indeed π²/6. So the exact answer is π²/6.

Now, for the numerical approximation. π² is approximately 9.8696044, so dividing by 6 gives approximately 1.6449340668. Let me check that with a calculator. π is about 3.1415926536, so π squared is (3.1415926536)^2. Let's compute that: 3.1415926536 * 3.1415926536. Let's see, 3*3=9, 3*0.14159≈0.42477, 0.14159*3≈0.42477, and 0.14159^2≈0.02005. Adding up: 9 + 0.42477 + 0.42477 + 0.02005 ≈ 9.86959. So π² ≈ 9.8696044, divided by 6 is approximately 1.644934066666... So rounding to 10 decimal places, that's 1.6449340668. Wait, but let me check with more precise calculation. Let me use a calculator for π². π is approximately 3.141592653589793. Squaring that gives 9.869604401089358. Dividing by 6 gives 9.869604401089358 / 6 = 1.6449340668482263. So rounding to 10 decimal places, that's 1.6449340668. So the numerical approximation is approximately 1.6449340668.

Therefore, the exact answer is π²/6, and the numerical value is approximately 1.6449340668.
