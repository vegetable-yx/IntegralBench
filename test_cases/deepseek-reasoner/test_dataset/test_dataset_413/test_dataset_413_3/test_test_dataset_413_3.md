Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of sqrt(2024 - x²) from 0 to 2√506. Hmm, first, I remember that the integral of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is a standard form. The antiderivative should involve an inverse sine function and a term with x times the square root, right? Let me recall the formula.

The integral of sqrt(a² - x²) dx from 0 to b is [(x/2)sqrt(a² - x²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(x/a))] evaluated from 0 to b. So in this case, a² is 2024, which means a is sqrt(2024). Wait, but the upper limit here is 2√506. Let me check if 2√506 is related to a. Let's compute (2√506)². That's 4*506 = 2024. Oh! So the upper limit is exactly a, because sqrt(2024) is a, and (2√506)² = 2024, so 2√506 is sqrt(2024). Wait, sqrt(2024) is sqrt(4*506) which is 2√506. Oh right! So the upper limit is a. That's important because the integral from 0 to a of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is (π a²)/4, since it's the area of a quarter of a circle with radius a. Wait, but let me confirm.

The integral from 0 to a of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is indeed (π a²)/4. Because the full circle area is π a², and integrating from 0 to a gives a quarter of that. So in this case, since the upper limit is a = sqrt(2024), the integral from 0 to a would be (π a²)/4. Therefore, substituting a² = 2024, the exact value is (π * 2024)/4. Simplifying that, 2024 divided by 4 is 506, so the exact answer is 506π.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let's go through the antiderivative step by step. Let me set a = sqrt(2024). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^a sqrt(a² - x²) dx. The antiderivative is (x/2)sqrt(a² - x²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(x/a). Evaluating from 0 to a. At x = a, the first term becomes (a/2)*0 = 0. The second term is (a²/2) sin⁻¹(1) which is (a²/2)*(π/2). So total is (a² π)/4. At x=0, both terms are 0. So yes, the integral is (a² π)/4. Since a² is 2024, the exact answer is 2024π/4 = 506π. That's straightforward.

Now, for the numerical approximation. 506 multiplied by π. Let's compute that. π is approximately 3.1415926535. So 506 * 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that step by step. 500*π is 1570.79632675, since 100π is 314.15926535, so 500π is 5*314.15926535 = 1570.79632675. Then 6π is 18.849555921. Adding them together: 1570.79632675 + 18.849555921 = 1589.645882671. So approximately 1589.645882671. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1589.645882671. Wait, let me check the multiplication again to be precise.

Alternatively, let's compute 506 * π. Let's use more accurate value of π: 3.141592653589793. So 506 * 3.141592653589793. Let's compute 500*3.141592653589793 = 1570.7963267948965. Then 6*3.141592653589793 = 18.849555921538758. Adding them: 1570.7963267948965 + 18.849555921538758 = 1589.6458827164353. So approximately 1589.6458827164. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1589.6458827164. Wait, but let's check the exact value. The exact value is 506π, so the numerical approximation is 506 multiplied by π. Let me verify with a calculator. 506 * π ≈ 506 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 1589.6458827164353. So yes, rounding to 10 decimal places would be 1589.6458827164. Wait, but the 10th decimal place is the 10th digit after the decimal. Let's count: 1589.6458827164. The digits after the decimal: 6 4 5 8 8 2 7 1 6 4. So the 10th is 4. But let's check if the next digit is 3 (from 1589.6458827164353), so after 1589.6458827164, the next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. So the numerical approximation is 1589.6458827164.

Wait, but maybe I should use more precise calculation. Let me use a calculator approach. Let's compute 506 * π:

π ≈ 3.1415926535897932384626433832795.

506 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795.

First, 500 * π = 500 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795 = 1570.79632679489661923132169163975.

6 * π = 6 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795 = 18.849555921538759430775860299677.

Adding these two:

1570.79632679489661923132169163975

+ 18.849555921538759430775860299677

= 1570.79632679489661923132169163975

+18.849555921538759430775860299677

Let's line up the decimals:

1570.79632679489661923132169163975

+  18.849555921538759430775860299677

= (1570 + 18) + (0.79632679489661923132169163975 + 0.849555921538759430775860299677)

= 1588 + (1.645882716435378662097551939427)

Wait, 0.796326794896619231 + 0.849555921538759430 = let's compute:

0.796326794896619231

+0.849555921538759430

= (0.7 + 0.8) + (0.096326794896619231 + 0.049555921538759430)

= 1.5 + 0.145882716435378661

= 1.645882716435378661

So total is 1588 + 1.645882716435378661 = 1589.645882716435378661. So the exact value up to more decimals is 1589.645882716435378661... So rounding to 10 decimal places, we look at the 11th decimal, which is 3 (from 435378661...). So 1589.6458827164 (first 10 decimals) and the 11th is 3, so we don't round up. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1589.6458827164.

So the exact answer is 506π, and the numerical is approximately 1589.6458827164. Let me just confirm once again that the upper limit is indeed a. The original integral is from 0 to 2√506. Since a² = 2024, a = sqrt(2024) = sqrt(4*506) = 2√506. So yes, the upper limit is exactly a. Therefore, the integral is (π a²)/4 = (π * 2024)/4 = 506π. That's correct. So the exact answer is 506π, and the numerical is approximately 1589.6458827164.
