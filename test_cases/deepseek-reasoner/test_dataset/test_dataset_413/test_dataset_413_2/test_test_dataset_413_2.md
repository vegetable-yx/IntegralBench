Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of sqrt(2024 - x²) from 0 to 2√506. Let me start by recalling how to handle integrals of the form sqrt(a² - x²). I remember that the integral of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is (x/2)sqrt(a² - x²) + (a²/2)arcsin(x/a) + C. That's a standard result, right? So maybe I can apply that here.

First, let me check if 2024 is a perfect square or if it can be written as something squared. Wait, 2024 divided by 4 is 506, which is the upper limit multiplied by 2. The upper limit is 2√506. Let me see: if a² = 2024, then a would be sqrt(2024). Let me compute sqrt(2024). Hmm, 2024 divided by 4 is 506, so sqrt(2024) is sqrt(4*506) which is 2*sqrt(506). Oh! So 2024 is (2√506)². That's interesting because the upper limit of the integral is exactly 2√506, which would be 'a' in the standard integral formula. So the integral from 0 to a of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is the area of a quarter of a circle with radius a, right? Because the integral represents the area under the curve from 0 to a, which is a quarter of the full circle.

Wait, let me confirm that. The equation y = sqrt(a² - x²) is the upper half of the circle x² + y² = a². So integrating from 0 to a would give the area of a quarter-circle. Therefore, the integral should be (π a²)/4. Let me check with the standard formula. The integral from 0 to a of sqrt(a² - x²) dx is indeed (π a²)/4. So in this case, a is 2√506. Therefore, the exact value should be (π*(2√506)²)/4. Let's compute that.

First, (2√506)² is 4*506 = 2024. So the integral is (π*2024)/4, which simplifies to (2024/4)π. 2024 divided by 4 is 506. So the exact answer is 506π. That seems straightforward. But let me verify using the standard antiderivative formula to make sure.

The antiderivative of sqrt(a² - x²) is (x/2)sqrt(a² - x²) + (a²/2)arcsin(x/a) + C. Let's compute this from 0 to a. At x = a, the first term becomes (a/2)*sqrt(a² - a²) = 0. The second term is (a²/2)arcsin(1) = (a²/2)*(π/2). So the total at the upper limit is (a²/2)*(π/2) = (a² π)/4. At x = 0, the first term is 0, and the second term is (a²/2)arcsin(0) = 0. So subtracting, the definite integral is (a² π)/4, which matches the quarter-circle area. So yes, the exact answer is 506π.

Now, the numerical approximation. I need to compute 506 multiplied by π and round it to 10 decimal places. Let me calculate that. π is approximately 3.1415926535. Multiplying by 506:

506 * 3.1415926535. Let's break it down. 500*3.1415926535 = 1570.79632675. Then 6*3.1415926535 = 18.849555921. Adding them together: 1570.79632675 + 18.849555921 = 1589.645882671. So approximately 1589.645882671. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1589.6458826710? Wait, let me check the exact multiplication.

Alternatively, use a calculator for precision. Let me compute 506 * π. π is approximately 3.141592653589793. So 506 * 3.141592653589793. Let's compute step by step:

3.141592653589793 * 500 = 1570.7963267948965

3.141592653589793 * 6 = 18.849555921538758

Adding them: 1570.7963267948965 + 18.849555921538758 = 1589.6458827164353

So the numerical value is approximately 1589.6458827164353. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1589.6458827164. Wait, let's count the decimal places. The number is 1589.6458827164353. The first ten digits after the decimal are 6458827164 (positions 1-10: 6,4,5,8,8,2,7,1,6,4). Wait, no. Let me write it out:

1589.6458827164353

Breaking down the decimal part: .6458827164353

So the first ten decimal places are 6,4,5,8,8,2,7,1,6,4. Then the next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't round up the fourth decimal. Wait, but wait, the number is .6458827164353. Let's count:

1:6, 2:4, 3:5, 4:8, 5:8, 6:2, 7:7, 8:1, 9:6, 10:4. The 11th digit is 3. So the 10th decimal is 4, and since the next digit is 3 <5, we leave it as is. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1589.6458827164.

Wait, but let me confirm with a calculator. Alternatively, use a calculator to compute 506 * π. Let me check with a calculator. 506 * π ≈ 506 * 3.141592653589793 = 1589.6458827164353. So yes, the exact value up to 13 decimal places is 1589.6458827164353. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 1589.6458827164. Wait, but wait, the 10th decimal is the 4th digit after the decimal? Wait no, the decimal part is after the whole number. Let me clarify:

The number is 1589.6458827164353. The decimal part is after the decimal point. So the first decimal place is 6, second 4, third 5, fourth 8, fifth 8, sixth 2, seventh 7, eighth 1, ninth 6, tenth 4. Then the next digit is 3. So when we round to 10 decimal places, we look at the 11th digit, which is 3. Since it's less than 5, we leave the tenth decimal place as 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1589.6458827164.

But let me check with another method. Let me use Python to compute this. For example, 506 * math.pi would give the precise value. Let's see:

In Python, math.pi is approximately 3.141592653589793. So 506 * math.pi = 506 * 3.141592653589793 = 506 * 3.141592653589793.

Calculating:

3.141592653589793 * 500 = 1570.7963267948965

3.141592653589793 * 6 = 18.849555921538758

Adding them gives 1570.7963267948965 + 18.849555921538758 = 1589.6458827164353

So the exact value is 1589.6458827164353. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 1589.6458827164. Wait, but when you round to 10 decimal places, you need to consider the digits after the decimal point. The number is 1589.6458827164353. The decimal part is 0.6458827164353. Let's count the decimal places:

1:6, 2:4, 3:5, 4:8, 5:8, 6:2, 7:7, 8:1, 9:6, 10:4, 11:3, 12:5, 13:3.

So up to the 10th decimal place: 0.6458827164 (digits 1-10). The 11th digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1589.6458827164.

So the exact answer is 506π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1589.6458827164. Therefore, the JSON output should be:

{"answer": "506\\pi", "numerical_answer": 1589.6458827164}

Wait, but let me check if the integral from 0 to 2√506 of sqrt(2024 -x²) dx is indeed 506π. Since 2024 = (2√506)^2, so the integral is (π*(2√506)^2)/4 = (π*4*506)/4 = 506π. Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is 506π. The numerical approximation is 506 multiplied by π, which is approximately 1589.6458827164 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
