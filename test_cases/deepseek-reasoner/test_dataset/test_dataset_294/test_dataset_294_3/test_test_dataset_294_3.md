Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of E(0.5√x) times E(√(1−x)) dx, where E is probably the elliptic integral. Wait, but which elliptic integral? There are the first and second kinds. The problem uses E without a subscript, so maybe it's the complete elliptic integral of the second kind? Or maybe the incomplete one? Hmm, the notation might be important here. Let me check. The user wrote E with an argument, so maybe it's the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, which is usually denoted as E(m) or E(k), where m is the parameter or k is the modulus. Wait, sometimes E(k) is the second kind with modulus k, and E(m) is with parameter m = k². So if the argument here is 0.5√x, then maybe that's the modulus k. Let me confirm. For example, the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} √(1−k² sin²θ) dθ. So if the argument is k, then that's the modulus. Alternatively, sometimes it's written with the parameter m = k². So E(m) would be the same as E(k) with m = k². So in this problem, if we have E(0.5√x), then if that's the modulus k, then m would be (0.5√x)² = 0.25x. Alternatively, if the argument is m, then k would be sqrt(m). Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check standard notation. In some references, E(k) is the second kind with modulus k, and m = k² is the parameter. So for example, in Mathematica, EllipticE[m] is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter m. So if the problem is using E as the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter m, then E(0.5√x) would have m = 0.5√x. But that seems a bit odd because the parameter m is usually between 0 and 1. Wait, 0.5√x when x is between 0 and 1 would make m between 0 and 0.5, which is valid. Similarly, √(1−x) when x is from 0 to 1 would make the argument go from 1 to 0. So if that's the parameter m, then when x approaches 1, the argument becomes 0 = 0, which is okay. But if the argument is the modulus k, then √(1−x) would be between 0 and 1, which is also okay. Hmm. Maybe the problem is using E as the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k. Let me proceed with that assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using E to denote the elliptic integral of the first kind. Wait, but the first kind is usually F or K. Wait, the complete elliptic integral of the first kind is K(k), and the second kind is E(k). So maybe here E is the second kind. So the integrand is E(k1) * E(k2), where k1 = 0.5√x and k2 = √(1−x). So the integral is ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Hmm. This seems complicated. I need to find an analytical expression for this integral. Let me think about possible approaches. Maybe expanding the elliptic integrals into their series representations and integrating term by term? Or perhaps using integral transforms or substitutions. Alternatively, maybe there's a known integral formula involving products of elliptic integrals. Let me check some references. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my own knowledge. Let me recall that sometimes products of elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, but integrating them might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution can simplify the integral. Let me consider changing variables. Let me set t = √x. Then x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the limits when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=1. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ E(0.5 t) E(√(1−t²)) * 2t dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me consider u = 1 - x. Then when x=0, u=1; x=1, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫₁⁰ E(0.5√(1−u)) E(√u) (-du) = ∫₀¹ E(0.5√(1−u)) E(√u) du. So the integral is symmetric in a way. But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express both elliptic integrals in terms of their integral definitions and then switch the order of integration. Let me try that. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind E(k) is ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 − k² sin²θ) dθ. So E(0.5√x) = ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 − (0.25 x) sin²θ) dθ. Similarly, E(√(1−x)) = ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 − (1−x) sin²φ) dφ. So the product E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) is a double integral over θ and φ of √(1 − 0.25x sin²θ) * √(1 − (1−x) sin²φ) dθ dφ. Then the original integral becomes a triple integral: ∫₀¹ [∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 − 0.25x sin²θ) √(1 − (1−x) sin²φ) dθ dφ] dx. Maybe we can interchange the order of integration, integrating over x first. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} [∫₀¹ √(1 − 0.25x sin²θ) √(1 − (1−x) sin²φ) dx] dθ dφ. Hmm, that seems complicated, but perhaps the inner integral over x can be evaluated. Let me denote A = 0.25 sin²θ and B = sin²φ. Then the inner integral is ∫₀¹ √(1 − A x) √(1 − B (1−x)) dx. Let me expand the product under the square roots. Wait, but the product of square roots is not the same as the square root of the product. So √(1 − A x) * √(1 − B + B x) = sqrt[(1 - A x)(1 - B + B x)]. Let me expand the terms inside: (1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) = (1 - B) + B x - A x (1 - B) - A B x². Let me collect terms: = (1 - B) + x(B - A(1 - B)) - A B x². Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's a substitution here. Let me denote C = 1 - B, D = B - A(1 - B), and E = -A B. Then the expression becomes C + D x + E x². So the inner integral is ∫₀¹ sqrt(C + D x + E x²) dx. But integrating sqrt(quadratic) can be done, but it's going to be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach. Let me consider if there's a substitution that can combine the variables. Let me think of x as a variable, and perhaps set y = 1 - x. Then the product becomes E(0.5√x) E(√y) where y = 1 - x. But I don't see an immediate symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps using integration by parts. Let me consider integrating E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) with respect to x. But integration by parts requires choosing a part to differentiate and a part to integrate. The problem is that both E functions depend on x, so differentiating them would lead to derivatives of elliptic integrals, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using the derivative of E(k). The derivative of E(k) with respect to k is (E(k) - K(k))/k, where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. But I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, maybe expanding each elliptic integral in a power series and then integrating term by term. Let me recall the series expansion for E(k). The complete elliptic integral of the second kind can be expressed as E(k) = (π/2) [1 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (( (2n-1)!! )/( (2n)!! ))² (k^{2n})/(2n - 1)) ] ]. Wait, actually, the series expansion for E(k) is E(k) = (π/2) [1 - Σ_{n=1}^∞ ( ( (2n - 1)!! ) / (2n)!! )² * (k^{2n}) / (2n - 1) ) ] Alternatively, maybe a hypergeometric representation. E(k) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). So if we can express both E(0.5√x) and E(√(1−x)) as hypergeometric functions, then their product might be expressed as a product of hypergeometric functions, and then integrating term by term. But multiplying two hypergeometric functions can lead to a double sum, which might be challenging to integrate. Let me try writing them as hypergeometric series. So E(k) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). Therefore, E(0.5√x) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 0.25x). Similarly, E(√(1−x)) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 1 - x). So the product is (π/2)^2 times the product of two hypergeometric functions. Then the integral becomes (π/2)^2 ∫₀¹ _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 0.25x) * _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 1 - x) dx. Hmm, this seems quite involved. Maybe there's a way to express the product of two hypergeometric functions as a single hypergeometric function or a sum, but I don't recall such an identity off the top of my head. Alternatively, perhaps using integral representations of hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric function _2F_1(a, b; c; z) can be represented by an integral, but combining two such integrals would lead to a triple integral, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe expanding each hypergeometric function as a power series and then integrating term by term. Let's try that. The first hypergeometric function _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 0.25x) can be expanded as Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / (1)_n n! ] (0.25x)^n. Similarly, the second one _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 1 - x) is Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / (1)_m m! ] (1 - x)^m. Then their product is the double sum over n and m of the product of the terms. Then the integral becomes (π/4)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] 0.25^n ∫₀¹ x^n (1 - x)^m dx. The integral ∫₀¹ x^n (1 - x)^m dx is the Beta function B(n+1, m+1) = Γ(n+1)Γ(m+1)/Γ(n + m + 2) = n! m! / (n + m + 1)! So substituting back, the integral becomes (π/4)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n (n! m! / (n + m + 1)! )) Simplifying terms: (π/4)^2 Σ_{n,m} [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m ) ) * 0.25^n / (n + m + 1)! ) ] The (1)_n = n! and (1)_m = m!, so the denominators (1)_n (1)_m) = n! m! which cancels with the n! m! in the numerator from the Beta function. So the expression simplifies to (π/4)^2 Σ_{n,m} [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m * 0.25^n / (n + m + 1)! ) ] Hmm, this is a double sum. Maybe we can find a closed-form expression for this. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing this as a hypergeometric function of two variables or a Kampé de Fériet function, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe changing variables in the summation. Let me set k = n + m. Then for each k, n ranges from 0 to k, and m = k - n. So the double sum becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^k [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_{k - n} (1/2)_{k - n} * 0.25^n / (k + 1)! ) ] This might not necessarily help, but let's see. The term (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n is the product of Pochhammer symbols. Let me compute these terms. For the first term, (-1/2)_n = (-1/2)(-1/2 + 1)...(-1/2 + n -1) = (-1/2)(1/2)...(n - 3/2). Similarly, (1/2)_n = (1/2)(3/2)...(1/2 + n -1). Similarly for the m terms. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or known series expansions. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry or a substitution that can be applied to the original integral. Let me think again. The original integral is ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Let me consider substituting x = sin²θ. Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. When x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} E(0.5 sinθ) E(√(1 - sin²θ)) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. But √(1 - sin²θ) is cosθ, so E(√(1 - x)) becomes E(cosθ). So the integral is 2 ∫₀^{π/2} E(0.5 sinθ) E(cosθ) sinθ cosθ dθ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me set t = sinθ, then θ = cosθ dt, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using some trigonometric identities. Alternatively, maybe expressing the elliptic integrals in terms of each other. Wait, E(k) and E(√(1 - k²)) are related, but I don't recall the exact relation. Alternatively, perhaps using Legendre's relation, which connects K(k), E(k), K'(k), E'(k), but that might not directly apply here. Alternatively, maybe considering the integral as a convolution or something. Alternatively, perhaps differentiating under the integral sign. Let me consider if there's a parameter that can be introduced to differentiate with respect to. Alternatively, maybe using the integral representation of the product of two elliptic integrals. Alternatively, perhaps looking for a substitution that combines the two arguments. Let me note that 0.5√x and √(1−x). If I set y = √x, then x = y², dx = 2y dy. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ E(0.5 y) E(√(1 - y²)) * 2y dy. Hmm, but this is similar to the substitution I tried earlier. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe using polar coordinates substitution. Let me think of y and √(1 - y²) as components of a unit circle. For example, if I set y = sinφ, then √(1 - y²) = cosφ. But I don't see how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps considering a substitution where u = 0.5√x and v = √(1−x), but that might not lead to a useful coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe using the integral definitions of E(k) and switching the order of integration. Let me try that again. So E(0.5√x) = ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 - 0.25x sin²θ) dθ and E(√(1−x)) = ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dφ. Then the original integral is ∫₀¹ [∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} √(1 - 0.25x sin²θ) √(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dθ dφ] dx. Switching the order of integration, we have ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} [∫₀¹ √(1 - 0.25x sin²θ) √(1 - (1 - x) sin²φ) dx] dθ dφ. Let me focus on the inner integral over x. Let me denote A = 0.25 sin²θ and B = sin²φ. Then the integrand becomes √(1 - A x) √(1 - B (1 - x)). Let me expand this product. So it's sqrt[(1 - A x)(1 - B + B x)]. Let me compute the product inside the square root: (1 - A x)(1 - B + B x) = (1 - B) + B x - A x (1 - B) - A B x². Let me collect like terms: = (1 - B) + x(B - A(1 - B)) - A B x². Let me denote this quadratic in x as C + D x + E x², where C = 1 - B, D = B - A(1 - B), E = -A B. So the inner integral is ∫₀¹ sqrt(C + D x + E x²) dx. Integrating sqrt(quadratic) can be done, but it's a bit involved. The integral of sqrt(a x² + b x + c) dx can be expressed in terms of logarithms and square roots, but it's quite complicated. Let me recall the formula. The integral ∫ sqrt(a x² + b x + c) dx can be written as:

( (2 a x + b) sqrt(a x² + b x + c) )/(4 a) + ( (4 a c - b²)/(8 a) ) ∫ 1/sqrt(a x² + b x + c) dx.

But since this is a definite integral from 0 to 1, maybe we can use the antiderivative. Alternatively, perhaps completing the square. Let me compute the quadratic under the square root: C + D x + E x² = E x² + D x + C. Let me write it as E x² + D x + C. Let me compute the discriminant: Δ = D² - 4 E C. Let's compute Δ:

Δ = B - A(1 - B) = B - A + A B
 = B(1 + A) - A.

E = -A B.

C = 1 - B.

So Δ = [B(1 + A) - A]^2 - 4*(-A B)*(1 - B).

This seems messy, but let's compute it step by step.

First, expand [B(1 + A) - A]^2:

= [B + A B - A]^2
= (B - A + A B)^2
= (B(1 + A) - A)^2
= B²(1 + A)^2 - 2 A B(1 + A) + A².

Then, compute 4 E C:

= -4*(-A B)(1 - B)
= 4 A B (1 - B).

So Δ = B²(1 + A)^2 - 2 A B(1 + A) + A² + 4 A B (1 - B).

Let me expand each term:

First term: B²(1 + 2A + A²)

Second term: -2 A B (1 + A) = -2 A B - 2 A² B

Third term: A²

Fourth term: 4 A B (1 - B) = 4 A B - 4 A B²

So combining all terms:

Δ = B² + 2 A B² + A² B² - 2 A B - 2 A² B + A² + 4 A B - 4 A B².

Let me collect like terms:

- Terms with B²: B² + 2 A B² + A² B² - 4 A B² = B²(1 + 2A + A² - 4A) = B²(1 - 2A + A²) = B²(1 - A)^2.

- Terms with B: -2 A B - 2 A² B + 4 A B = ( -2 A B + 4 A B ) + (-2 A² B) = 2 A B - 2 A² B = 2 A B(1 - A).

- Constant term: A².

So Δ = B²(1 - A)^2 + 2 A B(1 - A) + A².

Notice that this can be written as [B(1 - A) + A]^2:

Expand [B(1 - A) + A]^2 = B²(1 - A)^2 + 2 A B(1 - A) + A², which matches Δ. Therefore, Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2.

Therefore, sqrt(Δ) = B(1 - A) + A.

Therefore, the quadratic under the square root can be written as E x² + D x + C = E(x - h)^2 + k, but since the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic factors as (sqrt(E) x + something)^2. Wait, but since Δ is a perfect square, the quadratic can be factored as (sqrt(E) x + sqrt(C) + ... )? Wait, alternatively, since the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic can be written as (sqrt(E) x + (D)/(2 sqrt(E)) )^2 + (C - D²/(4 E)). But since Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2, then the quadratic can be expressed as (sqrt(E) x + (D)/(2 sqrt(E)) )^2 - (Δ)/(4 E). Wait, but since Δ is positive, this might not help. Alternatively, since the quadratic has real roots, but given that the original expression under the square root is positive for x in [0,1], since both factors (1 - A x) and (1 - B(1 - x)) are positive. Because A = 0.25 sin²θ ≤ 0.25, so A x ≤ 0.25*1 = 0.25 < 1. Similarly, B = sin²φ ≤ 1, so 1 - B(1 - x) ≥ 1 - (1)(1 - 0) = 0. So the product is non-negative. Therefore, the quadratic inside the square root is non-negative over [0,1]. But since the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic factors as (linear)^2. Let me check. If Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2, then the quadratic can be written as E x² + D x + C = (sqrt(E) x + (D - sqrt(Δ))/(2 sqrt(E)) )^2. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since Δ = (B(1 - A) + A)^2, then the quadratic can be written as (sqrt(E) x + something)^2. Let me try to factor it. Let me write E x² + D x + C = E x² + D x + C. Since Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2, then the roots are x = [ -D ± sqrt(Δ) ]/(2 E). Let me compute the roots:

x = [ -D ± (B(1 - A) + A) ]/(2 E).

But D = B - A(1 - B), so substituting:

x = [ - (B - A(1 - B)) ± (B(1 - A) + A) ]/(2*(-A B)).

Let me compute numerator for the '+' case:

- (B - A + A B) + B(1 - A) + A

= -B + A - A B + B - A B + A

= (-B + B) + (A + A) + (-A B - A B)

= 0 + 2A - 2 A B

= 2A(1 - B)

For the '-' case:

- (B - A + A B) - B(1 - A) - A

= -B + A - A B - B + A B - A

= (-B - B) + (A - A) + (-A B + A B)

= -2B + 0 + 0

= -2B

Therefore, the roots are:

x₁ = [2A(1 - B)] / (2*(-A B)) ) = [A(1 - B)] / (-A B) = -(1 - B)/B = (B - 1)/B

x₂ = (-2B) / (2*(-A B)) ) = (-2B) / (-2 A B) = 1/A

But since A = 0.25 sin²θ ≤ 0.25, so 1/A ≥ 4. Similarly, x₁ = (B - 1)/B. Since B = sin²φ ≤ 1, so B - 1 ≤ 0, so x₁ = negative. Therefore, the quadratic E x² + D x + C factors as E(x - x₁)(x - x₂). But since x₁ is negative and x₂ > 1, and the quadratic is from x=0 to x=1, which is between the roots. Therefore, the quadratic is positive in this interval. Therefore, sqrt(E x² + D x + C) can be written as sqrt(E) * sqrt((x - x₁)(x₂ - x)). But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, since the quadratic factors as (sqrt(E) x + ... )^2, but given the roots, maybe it's helpful. Alternatively, since the quadratic is positive between x₁ and x₂, and our integration is from 0 to 1, which is between x₁ (negative) and x₂ (greater than 1), so the quadratic is positive in [0,1]. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ sqrt(E x² + D x + C) dx. Let me recall that the integral of sqrt(a x² + b x + c) dx from x1 to x2 can be expressed in terms of logarithms and square roots. But since this is a definite integral, maybe we can use the antiderivative. Let me look up the antiderivative formula. The integral ∫ sqrt(a x² + b x + c) dx is:

( (2 a x + b) sqrt(a x² + b x + c) )/(4 a) + ( (4 a c - b²)/(8 a) ) * ln(2 sqrt(a) sqrt(a x² + b x + c) + 2 a x + b ) / sqrt(a) ) + C.

But this is quite complicated. Alternatively, since we have a perfect square discriminant, maybe there's a simpler form. Wait, we found that Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2. So sqrt(a x² + b x + c) = sqrt(E x² + D x + C) = sqrt( (sqrt(E) x + (D)/(2 sqrt(E)) )^2 + (C - D²/(4 E)) ). But since Δ = D² - 4 E C = [B(1 - A) + A]^2, and we have a perfect square, maybe the quadratic can be written as (something x + something)^2. Wait, but we already saw that the roots are x₁ and x₂, so maybe it's (sqrt(E)(x - x₁)(x₂ - x))^{1/2}. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since Δ = [B(1 - A) + A]^2, then sqrt(E x² + D x + C) = sqrt( (sqrt(E) x + (D - sqrt(Δ))/(2 sqrt(E)) )^2 ). Wait, no. Alternatively, since the quadratic can be written as (linear term)^2, but since the discriminant is a square, maybe it's a linear function squared. Let me check. Let me suppose that E x² + D x + C = (p x + q)^2. Then expanding, p² x² + 2 p q x + q² = E x² + D x + C. Therefore, equating coefficients:

p² = E,

2 p q = D,

q² = C.

From the first equation, p = sqrt(E) or -sqrt(E). Let's take p = sqrt(E). Then from the second equation, q = D/(2 sqrt(E)). Then from the third equation, q² = C. So substituting, (D/(2 sqrt(E)))^2 = C. Let's check if this holds. D = B - A(1 - B), C = 1 - B, E = -A B. So:

(D/(2 sqrt(E)))^2 = ( (B - A(1 - B)) / (2 sqrt(-A B)) )^2.

But sqrt(-A B) is imaginary since A and B are positive (A = 0.25 sin²θ, B = sin²φ). Therefore, this approach doesn't work. Therefore, the quadratic is not a perfect square of a real linear function, but since the discriminant is a perfect square, it can be factored into two real linear terms. Therefore, sqrt(E x² + D x + C) = sqrt( (alpha x + beta)(gamma x + delta) ). But since the roots are x₁ and x₂, we can write it as sqrt( E (x - x₁)(x - x₂) ). But since x₁ < 0 and x₂ > 1, then in the interval [0,1], the expression inside the square root is positive. Therefore, sqrt(E (x - x₁)(x₂ - x)) = sqrt(E (x₂ - x)(x - x₁)). But integrating this from 0 to 1 might be related to an elliptic integral again, which would not help. Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again about the original integral. It's the product of two elliptic integrals integrated over x from 0 to 1. Maybe there's a substitution that can transform this into a known integral. Let me consider if there's a substitution that can combine the two arguments. For example, if I set t = 0.5√x + √(1−x), but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe a substitution that relates to the sum or product of the arguments. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the integral is from 0 to 1, and the arguments are related through x and 1−x. Maybe there's a symmetry when x is replaced by 1−x. Let me check. If I substitute x → 1−x, then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ E(0.5√(1−x)) E(√x) dx. Which is the same as the original integral because the integrand is E(0.5√(1−x)) E(√x) and the variable of integration is x from 0 to 1. So the integral is symmetric in x and 1−x. Therefore, we can write the original integral as 1/2 ∫₀¹ [E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) + E(0.5√(1−x)) E(√x)] dx. But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe using this symmetry to combine terms. Alternatively, perhaps considering specific values of the elliptic integrals. For example, when x=0, E(0.5*0) = E(0) = π/2, and E(√1) = E(1). But E(1) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind at k=1, which is 1. Similarly, at x=1, E(0.5*1) = E(0.5), and E(0) = π/2. But integrating between these points. Alternatively, maybe numerical integration is the way to go, but the user asked for an analytical solution first. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps consulting integral tables. Wait, but I can't access them. Let me think if I recall any integrals involving products of elliptic integrals. I remember that sometimes integrals of products of elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials or other orthogonal polynomials. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the product of two elliptic integrals can be expressed as a sum involving elliptic integrals of higher order, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of the product. Let me think again about the original integral. Let me write it as ∫₀¹ E(a√x) E(b√(1−x)) dx, where a=0.5 and b=1. Maybe there's a general formula for this type of integral. Let me consider if there's a substitution that can turn this into a Beta function or something similar. Let me try substituting t = √x, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ E(a t) E(b√(1 - t²)) t dt. Now, this resembles an integral over a radial component in polar coordinates. Maybe changing variables to t = sinθ, so that √(1 - t²) = cosθ. Then t = sinθ, dt = cosθ dθ, and when t=0, θ=0; t=1, θ=π/2. So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} E(a sinθ) E(b cosθ) sinθ cosθ dθ. Hmm, this seems similar to integrating over an angle θ, with the product of E functions depending on sinθ and cosθ. Maybe there's a known integral over θ for this expression. Alternatively, perhaps expanding each E function in a Fourier series or a series in terms of θ. Alternatively, using the integral definitions of E(a sinθ) and E(b cosθ). Let me recall that E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - k² sin²φ) dφ. So E(a sinθ) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - a² sin²θ sin²φ) dφ. Similarly, E(b cosθ) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - b² cos²θ sin²ψ) dψ. Therefore, the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - a² sin²θ sin²φ) dφ] [∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - b² cos²θ sin²ψ) dψ] sinθ cosθ dθ. This is a triple integral. Maybe changing the order of integration. Let me write it as 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - a² sin²θ sin²φ) sqrt(1 - b² cos²θ sin²ψ) sinθ cosθ dφ dψ dθ. This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a way to separate variables. Alternatively, perhaps using some trigonometric identities. For example, the product of the two square roots can be written as sqrt[(1 - a² sin²θ sin²φ)(1 - b² cos²θ sin²ψ)]. This doesn't seem to factor nicely. Alternatively, maybe expanding each sqrt term in a power series. Let me try that. The square root can be expanded as a binomial series: sqrt(1 - z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (-1)^k (1/2 choose k) z^k ). So sqrt(1 - a² sin²θ sin²φ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (-1)^k (1/2 choose k) a^{2k} sin^{2k}θ sin^{2k}φ ). Similarly for the other sqrt term. Then the product becomes a double sum: Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{l=0}^∞ ( (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} sin^{2k}θ sin^{2k}φ cos^{2l}θ sin^{2l}ψ ). Then the triple integral becomes 2 Σ_{k,l} [ (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} ] ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k + 1}θ cos^{2l + 1}θ dθ ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}φ dφ ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2l}ψ dψ. The integrals over φ and ψ are standard: ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}φ dφ = (π/2) ( (2k - 1)!! ) / (2k)!! ). Similarly for the integral over ψ. The integral over θ is ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k + 1}θ cos^{2l + 1}θ dθ = (1/2) B(k + 1, l + 1) = (1/2) Γ(k + 1) Γ(l + 1) / Γ(k + l + 2). Therefore, putting it all together, the integral becomes 2 Σ_{k,l} [ (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} * (1/2) Γ(k + 1) Γ(l + 1) / Γ(k + l + 2) ) * (π/2) ( (2k - 1)!! ) / (2k)!! ) * (π/2) ( (2l - 1)!! ) / (2l)!! ) ) ] Simplifying, this is 2 * (1/2) * (π/2)^2 Σ_{k,l} [ (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} Γ(k + 1) Γ(l + 1) / Γ(k + l + 2) * ( (2k - 1)!! ) / (2k)!! ) * ( (2l - 1)!! ) / (2l)!! ) ) ] The terms (2k - 1)!! / (2k)!! = ( (2k)! ) / (2^k k! ) ) / (2^k k! ) ) = (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 ). Similarly for l. Also, Γ(k + 1) = k! and Γ(l + 1) = l!. Γ(k + l + 2) = (k + l + 1)! So substituting these in, the expression becomes (π²/4) Σ_{k,l} [ (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} (k! l! / (k + l + 1)! )) * ( (2k)! / (4^k (k!)^2 )) * ( (2l)! / (4^l (l!)^2 )) ) ] Simplifying further: (π²/4) Σ_{k,l} [ (-1)^{k+l} (1/2 choose k)(1/2 choose l) a^{2k} b^{2l} ( (2k)! (2l)! ) / (4^{k + l} (k! l! ) (k + l + 1)! )) ) ] Now, (1/2 choose k) is equal to ( (-1)^{k-1} (2k - 1)! ) / ( 2^{2k} (k! ) ) )? Wait, no. The generalized binomial coefficient (1/2 choose k) is defined as (1/2)(1/2 - 1)(1/2 - 2)...(1/2 - k + 1)/k! = (-1)^{k-1} ( (2k - 3)!! ) / (2^k k! ). For example, (1/2 choose k) = (-1)^{k-1} (2k - 1)!! / (2^{2k} k! ). Wait, let me compute (1/2 choose k):

(1/2 choose k) = (1/2)(1/2 - 1)(1/2 - 2)...(1/2 - k + 1)/k! = [ (1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)...( (1 - 2k)/2 ) ] / k! = [ (-1)^{k-1} (1 * 3 * 5 * ... (2k - 3)) ) / 2^k ] / k! = (-1)^{k-1} ( (2k - 2)! ) / ( 2^{2k - 1} (k - 1)! k! ) ). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, using the identity (1/2 choose k) = (-1)^{k-1} \frac{(2k - 2)!}{2^{2k - 1} k! (k - 1)!)} for k ≥ 1, and (1/2 choose 0) = 1. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, using the relation (1/2 choose k) = \frac{(-1)^{k-1} }{4^k k} \binom{2k - 2}{k - 1} for k ≥ 1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps expressing (1/2 choose k) in terms of factorials. Let me recall that (1/2 choose k) = \frac{\Gamma(1/2 + 1)}{\Gamma(k + 1) \Gamma(1/2 - k + 1)}. But this might not help. Alternatively, using the generating function: (1 - t)^{1/2} = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (1/2 choose k) (-t)^k. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the series coefficients for the hypergeometric function. Since E(k) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²), the coefficients involve (1/2 choose n) terms. But this might not help. Given the complexity of this approach, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me consider specific values. Let me set a = 0.5 and b = 1. Then the integral is ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Maybe there's a known value for this integral. Alternatively, perhaps using numerical integration to approximate the value, but the user wants an exact answer first. Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of known constants. Let me try to compute it numerically first to see if it matches any known constant. Let me approximate the integral numerically. Using numerical integration methods like Simpson's rule or using a calculator. But since I can't compute it here, I need to think of another way. Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to 2. But I need to check. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution x = sin^2(2θ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that E(k) has a series expansion, and multiplying two such series, then integrating term by term. Let me try that. Let me expand E(0.5√x) and E(√(1−x)) as their respective series. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind E(k) can be expressed as:

E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / ( 2^{2n} (n!)^2 ) )^2 * (1 - 2n)/(1 - 2n) ) k^{2n} ].

Wait, no. The series expansion for E(k) is:

E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (-1)^n (2n - 1)!! ) / (2^n n! ) )^2 * k^{2n} / (1 - 2n) ) ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the hypergeometric series:

E(k) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; k²).

So expanding this, we have:

E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] k^{2n}.

Similarly for E(√(1−x)) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] (1 - x)^m.

Therefore, the product is (π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] (0.5)^{2n} x^n (1 - x)^m.

Then the integral becomes (π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.5^{2n} ∫₀¹ x^n (1 - x)^m dx.

The integral ∫₀¹ x^n (1 - x)^m dx is the Beta function B(n+1, m+1) = n! m! / (n + m + 1)!.

Substituting back, the expression becomes:

(π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m ) ] 0.5^{2n} (n! m! / (n + m + 1)! )).

Simplifying the terms (1)_n = n! and (1)_m = m!, so they cancel with the n! m! in the numerator:

(π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m ] 0.5^{2n} / (n + m + 1)! ).

This double sum seems complicated, but perhaps it can be simplified. Let me consider the terms involving n and m. Let me denote k = n + m. Then for each k, n ranges from 0 to k, and m = k - n. So the sum becomes:

(π/2)^2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ Σ_{n=0}^k [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_{k - n} (1/2)_{k - n} ] 0.5^{2n} / (k + 1)! ).

This is a more manageable single sum over k. Let me compute the inner sum over n for each k. Let me denote the inner sum as S(k) = Σ_{n=0}^k [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_{k - n} (1/2)_{k - n} ] 0.5^{2n}.

This sum S(k) might have a closed-form expression. Let me compute it for small k to see a pattern.

For k=0: n=0:

S(0) = [ (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 ] 0.5^{0} = [1 * 1 *1 ] *1 =1.

For k=1: n=0 and n=1.

n=0:

[ (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 (-1/2)_1 (1/2)_1 ] 0.5^{0 = [1 *1*(-1/2)(1/2)] *1 = (-1/4).

n=1:

[ (-1/2)_1 (1/2)_1 (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 ] 0.5^{2} = [(-1/2)(1/2) *1*1 ] *0.25 = (-1/4) *0.25 = -1/16.

So S(1) = -1/4 -1/16 = -5/16.

For k=2:

n=0:

[1*1*(-1/2)(1/2)(-3/2)(3/2)] *1 = [1*1*( (-1/2)(-3/2) )( (1/2)(3/2) ) ] = [ (3/4) * (3/4) ) ] = 9/16.

Wait, no. Let me compute (-1/2)_2 = (-1/2)(-1/2 +1) = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Wait, no. The Pochhammer symbol (a)_n = a(a+1)...(a+n-1). So (-1/2)_2 = (-1/2)(-1/2 +1) = (-1/2)(1/2) = -1/4.

Similarly, (1/2)_2 = (1/2)(3/2) = 3/4.

So for k=2, n=0:

[ (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 (-1/2)_2 (1/2)_2 ] *0.5^{0} = [1*1*(-1/4)(3/4)] = -3/16.

n=1:

[ (-1/2)_1 (1/2)_1 (-1/2)_1 (1/2)_1 ] *0.5^{2} = [(-1/2)(1/2)(-1/2)(1/2)] *0.25 = [ (1/16) ] *0.25 = 1/64.

n=2:

[ (-1/2)_2 (1/2)_2 (-1/2)_0 (1/2)_0 ] *0.5^{4} = [(-1/4)(3/4)(1)(1)] *0.0625 = (-3/16) *0.0625 = -3/256.

So S(2) = -3/16 + 1/64 -3/256 = (-48/256 + 4/256 -3/256) = (-47/256).

This is getting messy. It seems like the inner sum S(k) doesn't have an obvious pattern. Therefore, this approach might not be fruitful. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might need to consider that this integral doesn't have a simple closed-form expression and that the answer might need to be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or other special functions. Alternatively, perhaps there's a clever substitution or identity that I'm missing. Let me think again about the original integral. The integral is ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Let me consider changing variables to t = sin²θ, which sometimes helps in integrals involving elliptic functions. Let x = sin²θ, so dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} E(0.5 sinθ) E(cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Now, E(cosθ) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus cosθ. There's an identity related to complementary moduli. For example, E(k) + E'(k) = something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the integral representation of E(k) and E(cosθ), perhaps combining the integrals. Let me write E(0.5 sinθ) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - 0.25 sin²θ sin²φ) dφ and E(cosθ) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - cos²θ sin²ψ) dψ. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(1 - 0.25 sin²θ sin²φ) sqrt(1 - cos²θ sin²ψ) dφ dψ] sinθ cosθ dθ. This is a quadruple integral, which seems even more complicated. I think I'm stuck here. Given that I can't find an analytical solution, perhaps the answer is a combination of elliptic integrals or hypergeometric functions, but I need to express it somehow. Alternatively, maybe the integral evaluates to a simple multiple of π². Let me guess that the exact answer is π²/4, but I need to check. Alternatively, for example, if I approximate the integral numerically, I can get a value and see if it's a known multiple of π². Let me try to approximate the integral numerically. Using numerical integration, say with x from 0 to 1, and evaluating E(0.5√x) and E(√(1−x)) at each point. For example, using midpoint rule with a few intervals. Let's approximate E(k) using the series expansion. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind E(k) can be approximated by the series:

E(k) = (π/2) [1 - (1/2)^2 k²/(1) - (1*3/(2*4))^2 k^4/3 - (1*3*5/(2*4*6))^2 k^6/5 - ... ].

But for a rough approximation, let's use a few terms. Let's compute the integral at a few points.

For x=0.5:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.5)) = E(0.5*0.7071) = E(0.35355). The value of E(0.35355) can be approximated. Using the series:

E(k) ≈ (π/2)[1 - (1/2)^2 k²/1 - ( (1*3)/(2*4) )^2 k^4/3 - ( (1*3*5)/(2*4*6) )^2 k^6/5 ].

For k=0.35355:

k² ≈ 0.125, k^4 ≈ 0.0156, k^6 ≈ 0.00195.

So:

E(0.35355) ≈ (π/2)[1 - (0.25 * 0.125)/1 - ( (3/8)^2 * 0.0156 )/3 - ( (15/48)^2 * 0.00195 )/5 ].

Calculating each term:

First term: 1

Second term: -0.25 * 0.125 = -0.03125

Third term: - (9/64) * 0.0156 /3 ≈ - (0.140625 * 0.0156)/3 ≈ -0.002197/3 ≈ -0.000732

Fourth term: - (225/2304) * 0.00195 /5 ≈ - (0.097656 * 0.00195)/5 ≈ -0.000190 /5 ≈ -0.000038

Total approximation: 1 - 0.03125 - 0.000732 - 0.000038 ≈ 0.96798

Multiply by π/2 ≈ 1.5708 * 0.96798 ≈ 1.520.

The actual value of E(0.35355) is approximately 1.5254, so this is close.

Similarly, E(√(1−0.5)) = E(√0.5) ≈ 1.35064.

So the integrand at x=0.5 is approximately 1.520 * 1.35064 ≈ 2.053.

Using the midpoint rule with a few intervals:

Let's take n=0.5 as the midpoint. The integral would be approximately 2.053 * 1 (width) = 2.053, which is a rough estimate. But this is just one point. Let's try with two intervals. Divide [0,1] into two intervals: [0,0.5] and [0.5,1]. Take midpoints at x=0.25 and x=0.75.

At x=0.25:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.25)) = E(0.5*0.5) = E(0.25). E(0.25) ≈ 1.4675.

E(√(1−0.25)) = E(√0.75) ≈ E(0.8660) ≈ 1.4675.

Product: 1.4675 * 1.4675 ≈ 2.153.

At x=0.75:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.75)) = E(0.5*0.8660) = E(0.4330). E(0.4330) ≈ 1.475.

E(√(1−0.75)) = E(√0.25) = E(0.5) ≈ 1.4675.

Product: 1.475 * 1.4675 ≈ 2.166.

Average of the two midpoints: (2.153 + 2.166)/2 ≈ 2.1595. Multiply by the interval width (0.5 each, total 1): 2.1595. This is still a rough estimate. The actual value is likely around 2.15. However, this is just a numerical approximation. The user wants an exact analytical solution, which I'm struggling to find. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might need to conclude that the integral doesn't have a simple closed-form expression and must be left in terms of elliptic integrals or hypergeometric functions. However, the problem states to compute it analytically to obtain the exact answer, so there must be a way. Let me think again. Perhaps using integration by parts. Let me set u = E(0.5√x) and dv = E(√(1−x)) dx. Then du would be the derivative of E(0.5√x) with respect to x, and v would be the integral of E(√(1−x)) dx. But integrating E(√(1−x)) dx might not be straightforward. Let me compute du. The derivative of E(k) with respect to k is d/dk E(k) = (E(k) - K(k))/k, where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. So if k = 0.5√x, then dk/dx = 0.5/(2√x) = 1/(4√x). Therefore, du/dx = dE/dk * dk/dx = (E(k) - K(k))/k * 1/(4√x) = (E(0.5√x) - K(0.5√x)) / (0.5√x) * 1/(4√x) = (E(0.5√x) - K(0.5√x)) / (0.5 x^{1/2}) * 1/(4 x^{1/2}) ) = (E(0.5√x) - K(0.5√x)) / (2 x). This seems complicated. Then v would be the integral of E(√(1−x)) dx. Let me make a substitution t = √(1−x). Then x = 1 - t², dx = -2t dt. So ∫ E(t) (-2t) dt = 2 ∫ t E(t) dt. The integral of t E(t) dt might be expressible in terms of elliptic integrals, but I'm not sure. This approach is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's a different substitution. Let me consider the original integral again: ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Let me try substituting t = √x. Then x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ E(0.5 t) E(√(1 - t²)) t dt. Now, this resembles an integral of t E(a t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Maybe there's a substitution that can combine t and √(1 - t²). Let me set t = sinθ, so √(1 - t²) = cosθ, dt = cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} E(0.5 sinθ) E(cosθ) sinθ cosθ dθ. This is the same as before. Maybe integrating over θ. Let me consider expanding E(0.5 sinθ) and E(cosθ) in Fourier series. Alternatively, using their series expansions. Let me expand E(0.5 sinθ) and E(cosθ) using their hypergeometric series. E(0.5 sinθ) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; 0.25 sin²θ). E(cosθ) = (π/2) _2F_1(-1/2, 1/2; 1; cos²θ). The product of these two hypergeometric functions would then be multiplied by sinθ cosθ and integrated over θ. This seems very involved. Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of the hypergeometric function. The hypergeometric function _2F_1(a, b; c; z) can be represented as an integral, but combining two such integrals would lead to a triple integral. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to conclude that this integral doesn't have a simple closed-form expression and must be evaluated numerically. However, the problem states to compute it analytically, so perhaps there's a trick I'm missing. Let me think of integrating the product of two elliptic integrals. There's a paper or identity that might help, but I can't recall. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the arguments of the elliptic integrals are related through x and 1−x. Maybe there's a substitution that swaps x and 1−x. Let me try substituting x = 1 - t², then dx = -2t dt. The integral becomes ∫₁⁰ E(0.5√(1 - t²)) E(t) (-2t) dt = 2 ∫₀¹ E(0.5√(1 - t²)) E(t) t dt. This is similar to the previous substitution. Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps adding the two expressions. Let me denote I = ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) dx. Then, using the substitution x → 1−x, we have I = ∫₀¹ E(0.5√(1−x)) E(√x) dx. Adding these two expressions, 2I = ∫₀¹ [E(0.5√x) E(√(1−x)) + E(0.5√(1−x)) E(√x)] dx. But I don't know if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps considering the average of the two integrals. But without a relationship between E(0.5√x) and E(√x), this might not help. Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with a numerical approximation. Let me use numerical integration to approximate the integral. Using a tool like Mathematica or a calculator, but since I can't, I'll use a simple method. Let's use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. Let's divide the interval [0,1] into n=4 intervals: x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1. Compute the integrand at these points.

At x=0:

E(0.5*0) = E(0) = π/2 ≈ 1.5708.

E(√1) = E(1) = 1.

Product: 1.5708 * 1 = 1.5708.

At x=0.25:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.25)) = E(0.5*0.5) = E(0.25) ≈ 1.4675.

E(√(0.75)) ≈ E(0.8660) ≈ 1.4675.

Product: 1.4675 * 1.4675 ≈ 2.153.

At x=0.5:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.5)) ≈ E(0.3535) ≈ 1.5254.

E(√0.5) ≈ 1.3506.

Product: 1.5254 * 1.3506 ≈ 2.059.

At x=0.75:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.75)) ≈ E(0.5*0.8660) ≈ E(0.4330) ≈ 1.475.

E(√0.25) = E(0.5) ≈ 1.4675.

Product: 1.475 * 1.4675 ≈ 2.166.

At x=1:

E(0.5*1) = E(0.5) ≈ 1.4675.

E(0) = π/2 ≈ 1.5708.

Product: 1.4675 * 1.5708 ≈ 2.305.

Using the trapezoidal rule:

Integral ≈ (0.25/2) [f(0) + 2(f(0.25) + f(0.5) + f(0.75)) + f(1)]

= 0.125 [1.5708 + 2*(2.153 + 2.059 + 2.166) + 2.305]

= 0.125 [1.5708 + 2*(6.378) + 2.305]

= 0.125 [1.5708 + 12.756 + 2.305]

= 0.125 [16.6318] ≈ 2.078975.

This is an approximation with the trapezoidal rule using 4 intervals. The exact value is likely around 2.08. To get a better approximation, let's use more intervals. But since this is time-consuming, I'll assume the numerical value is approximately 2.08. However, the user wants 10 decimal places. Given that I can't compute it precisely here, I'll have to state that the exact answer is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.08. However, this is not precise. Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is 2. But my approximation suggests it's around 2.08. Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is π²/4 ≈ 2.4674, but my approximation is lower. Alternatively, π²/8 ≈ 1.2337, which is too low. Alternatively, 2. But my approximation is around 2.08. Therefore, I think the exact answer is not a simple multiple of π². Given that I can't find an analytical solution, I'll have to present the integral in terms of the original elliptic integrals and provide a numerical approximation. However, the problem insists on an exact answer. Therefore, I must have missed something. Let me think again. Perhaps there's a substitution that can express the integral in terms of a single elliptic integral. Let me consider the substitution t = √x. Then x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ t E(0.5 t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Now, this resembles integrating t times the product of two elliptic integrals. Maybe there's a known integral formula for this. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that E(√(1 - t²)) is related to E'(k), the complementary elliptic integral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution like t = sinθ, leading to an integral over θ. But I tried that earlier. Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to conclude that the exact answer is expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function or a combination of elliptic integrals, and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.08. However, since the user requires an exact answer, I must have to look for another approach. Let me consider the original integral again. Let me write it as ∫₀¹ E(a√x) E(b√(1−x)) dx with a=0.5 and b=1. Maybe there's a general formula for this integral. Let me consider if this integral can be expressed as a product of two integrals. For example, if the integral of the product is the product of the integrals, but that's only true if the functions are independent, which they are not. Alternatively, perhaps using convolution. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the arguments are related through x and 1−x. Maybe there's a relationship between E(a√x) and E(b√(1−x)) that can be exploited. Alternatively, perhaps using the addition formula for elliptic integrals, but I'm not aware of such a formula. Given that I can't find an analytical solution, I'll have to proceed with the numerical approximation. Based on the trapezoidal rule with 4 intervals, the integral is approximately 2.078. To get a better approximation, let's use Simpson's rule with the same points. Simpson's rule for n=4 intervals (which requires an even number of intervals) is:

Integral ≈ (Δx/3) [f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + f(x4)]

Where Δx=0.25, x0=0, x1=0.25, x2=0.5, x3=0.75, x4=1.

Using the values:

f(0) = 1.5708

f(0.25) = 2.153

f(0.5) = 2.059

f(0.75) = 2.166

f(1) = 2.305

So:

Integral ≈ (0.25/3) [1.5708 + 4*2.153 + 2*2.059 + 4*2.166 + 2.305]

Calculate the terms inside:

1.5708 + 4*2.153 = 1.5708 + 8.612 = 10.1828

2*2.059 = 4.118

4*2.166 = 8.664

Adding up: 10.1828 + 4.118 + 8.664 + 2.305 = 25.2698

Multiply by 0.25/3 ≈ 0.083333:

25.2698 * 0.083333 ≈ 2.1057.

This is a better approximation. Using Simpson's rule, the integral is approximately 2.1057. To get more accurate result, we'd need more intervals, but this suggests the value is around 2.105. Let me check with another method. Using the midpoint rule with more intervals. For example, with n=4 intervals, midpoints at 0.125, 0.375, 0.625, 0.875.

At x=0.125:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.125)) = E(0.5*0.3535) = E(0.17675) ≈ (π/2)[1 - (0.17675²)/2 - (0.17675^4)/8 - ... ] ≈ 1.530.

E(√(1−0.125)) = E(√0.875) ≈ E(0.9354) ≈ 1.019.

Product: 1.530 * 1.019 ≈ 1.559.

At x=0.375:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.375)) = E(0.5*0.6124) = E(0.3062) ≈ 1.500.

E(√(1−0.375)) = E(√0.625) ≈ E(0.7906) ≈ 1.350.

Product: 1.500 * 1.350 ≈ 2.025.

At x=0.625:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.625)) = E(0.5*0.7906) = E(0.3953) ≈ 1.480.

E(√(1−0.625)) = E(√0.375) ≈ E(0.6124) ≈ 1.4675.

Product: 1.480 * 1.4675 ≈ 2.173.

At x=0.875:

E(0.5*sqrt(0.875)) = E(0.5*0.9354) = E(0.4677) ≈ 1.460.

E(√(1−0.875)) = E(√0.125) ≈ E(0.3535) ≈ 1.525.

Product: 1.460 * 1.525 ≈ 2.2265.

Midpoint sum: (1.559 + 2.025 + 2.173 + 2.2265) = 7.9835. Multiply by interval width 0.25: 7.9835 * 0.25 ≈ 1.9959. This is lower than the Simpson's rule result. The discrepancy suggests that more intervals are needed for accuracy. Given the time I've spent and the lack of convergence, I'll have to approximate the numerical value as around 2.10. However, the user requires 10 decimal places. Given that I can't compute it precisely here, I'll have to state that the exact answer is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.10. However, this is not meet the user's requirement of 10 decimal places. Therefore, I must conclude that I'm unable to find the exact analytical solution and must provide the numerical approximation based on available methods. However, the problem states that an exact answer exists. Given that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with the numerical approximation and state the exact answer in terms of the original integral. But the user insists on an exact answer. Therefore, I must have missed a key insight. Let me think again. Perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of a double hypergeometric function. Given that the original integral is a product of two hypergeometric functions integrated over x, the result might be a Kampé de Fériet function or a generalized hypergeometric function. However, I'm not familiar with the exact form. Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation:

∫₀¹ _2F_1(a,b;c;0.25x) _2F_1(a,b;c;1−x) dx.

But I don't know the closed-form for this. Given that I can't find an exact solution, I'll have to present the integral as is and provide a numerical approximation. However, the problem requires an exact answer. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me consider a different substitution. Let me set t = √x, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. The integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ t E(0.5 t) E(√(1 - t²)) dt. Now, let me consider expanding E(0.5 t) and E(√(1 - t²)) in their series expansions. E(k) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] k^{2n}. So:

E(0.5 t) = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] (0.5 t)^{2n} = (π/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n / ( (1)_n n! ) ] 0.25^n t^{2n}.

E(√(1 - t²)) = (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_m m! ) ] (1 - t²)^m.

Therefore, the product is (π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n t^{2n} (1 - t²)^m.

The integral becomes 2*(π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n ∫₀¹ t^{2n + 1} (1 - t²)^m dt.

The integral ∫₀¹ t^{2n + 1} (1 - t²)^m dt can be evaluated by substituting u = t², du = 2t dt, so dt = du/(2√u). The integral becomes ∫₀¹ u^{n} (1 - u)^m * (1/(2√u)) du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{n - 1/2} (1 - u)^m du = (1/2) B(n + 1/2, m + 1) = (1/2) Γ(n + 1/2) Γ(m + 1) / Γ(n + m + 3/2).

Therefore, the integral becomes 2*(π/2)^2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n * (1/2) Γ(n + 1/2) Γ(m + 1) / Γ(n + m + 3/2).

Simplifying, this is (π²/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n * Γ(n + 1/2) Γ(m + 1) / Γ(n + m + 3/2).

This expression is quite complex, but perhaps it can be simplified using properties of the Gamma function. Recall that Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π / (4^n n! ), and Γ(m + 1) = m!.

Substituting these in:

Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π / (4^n n! )

Γ(m + 1) = m!.

Γ(n + m + 3/2) = (n + m + 1/2) Γ(n + m + 1/2).

But Γ(n + m + 3/2) = (n + m + 1/2)(n + m - 1/2)...(1/2) √π.

This might not help directly. However, substituting Γ(n + 1/2) and Γ(m + 1):

The expression becomes:

(π²/2) Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! m! ) ] 0.25^n * ( (2n)! √π / (4^n n! ) ) m! / Γ(n + m + 3/2).

Simplifying terms:

Cancel m! in numerator and denominator.

The term (2n)! / (4^n n! ) can be written as (2n)! / (2^{2n} n! )).

Also, 0.25^n = (1/4)^n = 1/2^{2n}.

So 0.25^n * (2n)! / (4^n n! ) = (2n)! / (2^{4n} n! ).

But this seems complicated. The expression is:

(π²/2) √π Σ_{n=0}^∞ Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1/2)_n (1/2)_n (-1/2)_m (1/2)_m / ( (1)_n (1)_m n! ) ] (2n)! / (2^{4n} n! ) * 1 / Γ(n + m + 3/2).

This is extremely complex and likely doesn't have a closed-form. Therefore, I must conclude that the exact answer cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and requires hypergeometric functions or other advanced special functions. Therefore, the exact answer is the original integral expression, and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.105. However, the user requires an exact answer, so I must have missed a key step. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to provide the exact answer in terms of the integral and the numerical approximation.
