Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times the natural logarithm of the square root of x(1-x) plus the square root of 1 + x(1-x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to simplify the expression inside the logarithm first.

First, let me write down the integrand more clearly. The function inside the log is sqrt(x(1 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)). Let me denote the argument of the logarithm as A, so A = sqrt(x(1 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)). Maybe simplifying A could help. Let's compute A squared to see if that leads to something manageable.

Calculating A²:
A² = [sqrt(x(1 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 - x))]^2
= x(1 - x) + 2*sqrt(x(1 - x)(1 + x(1 - x))} + 1 + x(1 - x)
Simplify the terms:
First term: x(1 - x)
Second term: 2*sqrt(x(1 - x)(1 + x(1 - x)))
Third term: 1
Fourth term: x(1 - x)
So combining first and fourth terms: 2x(1 - x) + 1 + 2*sqrt(...)

Wait, let's compute that step by step. Let me compute each part:

A² = x(1 - x) + 2*sqrt{x(1 - x)[1 + x(1 - x)]} + 1 + x(1 - x)
Wait, no, the first term is x(1 - x), then the cross term is 2*sqrt(x(1 - x)) * sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)), and the last term is 1 + x(1 - x). Wait, no, the original expression inside the log is sqrt(x(1 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)). So when we square that, it's [sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)]² = a + 2sqrt(ab) + b, where a = x(1 - x) and b = 1 + x(1 - x). Therefore:

A² = a + b + 2sqrt(ab)
= x(1 - x) + 1 + x(1 - x) + 2sqrt{x(1 - x)[1 + x(1 - x)]}
Simplify the terms:
x(1 - x) + x(1 - x) = 2x(1 - x)
So A² = 2x(1 - x) + 1 + 2sqrt{x(1 - x)[1 + x(1 - x)]}

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let me compute the product inside the square root:

x(1 - x)[1 + x(1 - x)] = x(1 - x) + [x(1 - x)]²

Let me compute that:

First term: x(1 - x) = x - x²
Second term: [x(1 - x)]² = x²(1 - x)^2 = x²(1 - 2x + x²) = x² - 2x³ + x^4

So the product is (x - x²) + (x² - 2x³ + x^4) = x - x² + x² - 2x³ + x^4 = x - 2x³ + x^4

So sqrt(ab) = sqrt(x - 2x³ + x^4). Hmm, maybe factor that expression inside the square root.

x - 2x³ + x^4 = x^4 - 2x³ + x. Let's factor:

Factor out an x: x(x³ - 2x² + 1). Let's check if x³ - 2x² + 1 factors. Let me try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1. Testing x=1: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0. So (x - 1) is a factor.

Divide x³ - 2x² + 1 by (x - 1):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's do synthetic division for x=1:

Coefficients: 1 | -2 | 0 | 1 (Wait, original polynomial is x³ - 2x² + 0x + 1?)

Wait, original is x³ - 2x² + 1. So coefficients are 1, -2, 0, 1. Wait, no, x³ term is 1, x² is -2, x term is 0, constant term is 1. Wait, but when we factor (x - 1), let's check:

At x=1: 1 - 2 + 0 + 1 = 0. So (x - 1) is a factor. Then, divide x³ - 2x² + 1 by (x - 1):

Using synthetic division:

1 | 1  -2  0  1
        1  -1 -1
      1  -1 -1  0

So quotient is x² - x -1. Therefore, x³ - 2x² +1 = (x -1)(x² - x -1). Therefore, the expression inside the square root is x(x -1)(x² - x -1). Wait, but x^4 - 2x³ +x = x(x³ - 2x² +1) = x(x -1)(x² - x -1). Hmm, but x² - x -1 doesn't have real roots, so maybe that's as far as we can factor. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can be made here. Let me think. The integrand is x ln(sqrt(x(1 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 - x))) dx from 0 to 1. Let me denote t = x(1 - x). Then, t = x - x². Then, dt/dx = 1 - 2x. Hmm, but integrating x ln(...) dx. Not sure if substitution helps here.

Alternatively, maybe the expression inside the log can be simplified. Let me look at sqrt(t) + sqrt(1 + t), where t = x(1 - x). Let me compute sqrt(t) + sqrt(1 + t). Let me set u = sqrt(t). Then, the expression becomes u + sqrt(1 + u²). Wait, that's a known form. The expression u + sqrt(1 + u²) is reminiscent of hyperbolic functions. For example, sinh^{-1}(u) = ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)). Wait, but here we have u + sqrt(1 + u²). Let me check:

If we let u = sinh(v), then sqrt(1 + u²) = cosh(v), so u + sqrt(1 + u²) = sinh(v) + cosh(v) = e^v. Therefore, ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)) = v. But here, the argument of the log is u + sqrt(1 + u²) = e^v, so ln(e^v) = v. Therefore, ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)) = sinh^{-1}(u). Wait, but sinh^{-1}(u) = ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)), so actually, ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)) would be ln(sinh^{-1}(u)), but that's not helpful here. Wait, no. Wait, the expression inside the log is u + sqrt(1 + u²), which is equal to e^{sinh^{-1}(u)}. Therefore, ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)) = sinh^{-1}(u). Wait, no, sinh^{-1}(u) is equal to ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)). Therefore, ln(u + sqrt(1 + u²)) = sinh^{-1}(u). Therefore, the integrand becomes x * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) where t = x(1 - x). So maybe we can rewrite the integral as x * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 - x))) dx from 0 to 1.

Hmm, that might be a useful substitution. Let me write that down:

Let’s set t = x(1 - x), so t = x - x². Then, sqrt(t) = sqrt(x(1 - x)). Then, the integrand is x * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) dx. But integrating this with respect to x might not be straightforward. Maybe integration by parts?

Integration by parts: Let’s let u = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)), dv = x dx. Then, du = derivative of sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) with respect to x, and v = x² / 2. Wait, but t is a function of x, so du/dx = derivative of sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) with respect to t times dt/dx. Let me compute that.

First, derivative of sinh^{-1}(z) with respect to z is 1 / sqrt(z² + 1). So here, z = sqrt(t), so derivative is 1 / sqrt(z² + 1) * dz/dt * dt/dx. Wait, chain rule: du/dx = [1 / sqrt(z² + 1)] * dz/dt * dt/dx. But z = sqrt(t), so dz/dt = 1/(2 sqrt(t)). Therefore, du/dx = [1 / sqrt(t + 1)] * [1/(2 sqrt(t))] * dt/dx. Then, dt/dx = 1 - 2x. So putting it all together:

du/dx = [1 / (2 sqrt(t) sqrt(t + 1))] * (1 - 2x)

But t = x(1 - x), so t + 1 = 1 + x - x². Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let me see if integration by parts is feasible here.

So, integration by parts gives:

Integral from 0 to1 of x sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) dx = [ (x² / 2) sinh^{-1}(sqrt(t)) ] from 0 to1 - Integral from 0 to1 of (x² / 2) * du/dx dx

But evaluating the first term at 1 and 0. At x=1, t = 1*(1 -1) =0, so sinh^{-1}(0) = 0. Similarly, at x=0, t=0, so sinh^{-1}(0) =0. Therefore, the first term is 0. So the integral becomes -1/2 times the integral from 0 to1 of x² * du/dx dx.

But du/dx is [1 / (2 sqrt(t) sqrt(t + 1))] * (1 - 2x). So substituting back:

-1/2 * Integral x² * [1 / (2 sqrt(t) sqrt(t + 1))] * (1 - 2x) dx

Simplify constants: -1/(4) Integral [x² (1 - 2x) / (sqrt(t) sqrt(t + 1))] dx

But t = x(1 - x), so sqrt(t) = sqrt(x(1 - x)), and sqrt(t +1) = sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)). Therefore, the denominator is sqrt(x(1 - x)) * sqrt(1 + x(1 - x)).

But the original integrand was x times the log of sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x)), which we transformed into x sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))). So after integration by parts, we have this other integral. Not sure if this is helpful. Maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can simplify the expression. Let me consider substituting x = sin²θ or something trigonometric. Let me try x = sin²θ. Then, dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. The limits when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. Let's see:

But substituting x = sin²θ, then 1 - x = cos²θ, so x(1 -x) = sin²θ cos²θ. Then sqrt(x(1 -x)) = sinθ cosθ. Then, sqrt(1 + x(1 -x)) = sqrt(1 + sin²θ cos²θ). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me compute the argument inside the log:

sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x)) = sinθ cosθ + sqrt(1 + sin²θ cos²θ)

Not sure if that's better. Maybe another substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression inside the log can be rewritten. Let me consider sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a = x(1 -x) and b = 1 + x(1 -x). Then, b = 1 + a. So the expression is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a). Let me set a = sinh²t or something. Wait, if a = sinh²t, then sqrt(a) = sinh t, sqrt(1 + a) = cosh t, so sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a) = sinh t + cosh t = e^t. Then, ln(sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a)) = ln(e^t) = t. But t = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)). Therefore, ln(sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a)) = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)). So that's the same as before. Therefore, the integrand is x * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)) where a = x(1 -x). So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ x sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx. Hmm, so maybe integrating this expression.

But integrating x sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx is still not straightforward. Maybe another substitution. Let me consider substitution for the argument inside sinh^{-1}. Let’s set u = sqrt(x(1 -x)). Then, u² = x - x². Let me compute du:

du/dx = (1 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(x(1 -x))). Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution that can exploit symmetry. The limits are from 0 to1, and x(1 -x) is symmetric around x=0.5. Let me try substitution x = (1 - t)/2. Wait, no, maybe x = 1 - t. Let me check:

Let t = 1 - x. Then, when x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. The integral becomes ∫₁⁰ (1 - t) ln(sqrt((1 - t)t) + sqrt(1 + (1 - t)t)) (-dt). Which is same as ∫₀¹ (1 - t) ln(sqrt(t(1 - t)) + sqrt(1 + t(1 - t))) dt. Adding this to the original integral, which is ∫₀¹ x ln(...) dx. So if we add the original integral I and the transformed integral I', we get I + I' = ∫₀¹ [x + (1 - x)] ln(...) dx = ∫₀¹ ln(...) dx. So I + I' = ∫₀¹ ln(sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x))) dx. But I = I' due to symmetry, so 2I = ∫₀¹ ln(...) dx. Therefore, I = (1/2) ∫₀¹ ln(...) dx. Hmm, interesting. So maybe this reduces the problem to computing the integral of the logarithm term over [0,1], then dividing by 2.

But then we need to compute ∫₀¹ ln(sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x))) dx. Let me denote this integral as J. Then, I = J / 2. So if we can compute J, then we can find I.

But how to compute J? Let me think. Let me recall that earlier, we saw that ln(sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a)) = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)), where a = x(1 -x). So J = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx. Hmm, integrating sinh^{-1} of a quadratic function. Not sure. Maybe another substitution. Let me try substitution t = x - 1/2, so that the function becomes symmetric around t=0. Let x = t + 1/2, then when x=0, t=-1/2; x=1, t=1/2. Then, x(1 -x) = (t + 1/2)(1 - t -1/2) = (t + 1/2)(1/2 - t) = (1/2 - t)(1/2 + t) = (1/4 - t²). So x(1 -x) = 1/4 - t². Therefore, sqrt(x(1 -x)) = sqrt(1/4 - t²). Then, sqrt(1 + x(1 -x)) = sqrt(1 + 1/4 - t²) = sqrt(5/4 - t²). Therefore, the argument of the log becomes sqrt(1/4 - t²) + sqrt(5/4 - t²). So J becomes ∫_{-1/2}^{1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) dt. Wait, no, sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)) where a = x(1 -x) = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the integrand is sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)). But integrating this from -1/2 to 1/2. Maybe this is even function, so J = 2 ∫₀^{1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) dt. Still not obvious.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t². Then, when t=0, u=0; t=1/2, u=1/4. Then, dt = du/(2 sqrt(u)). Hmm, but not helpful. Alternatively, set v = sqrt(1/4 - t²). Then, t = sqrt(1/4 - v²). Then, dt = (-v)/sqrt(1/4 - v²) dv. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe consider polar coordinates or trigonometric substitution. Let me set t = (1/2) sinθ. Then, when t=0, θ=0; t=1/2, θ=π/2. Then, sqrt(1/4 - t²) = sqrt(1/4 - (1/4) sin²θ) = (1/2) sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = (1/2) cosθ. Then, sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) = sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ). Then, dt = (1/2) cosθ dθ. So J becomes 2 * ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) * (1/2) cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) * cosθ dθ. Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe integrating by parts again.

Let me try integrating J = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx. Let’s set u = sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))), dv = dx. Then, du = derivative as before, and v = x. So integration by parts gives:

J = [x sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x)))]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x * du/dx dx

Again, evaluating the first term at 1 and 0. At x=1, sqrt(x(1 -x)) =0, so sinh^{-1}(0)=0. Similarly at x=0, same. So first term is 0. Then, J = - ∫₀¹ x * du/dx dx. Compute du/dx:

As before, du/dx = [1 / sqrt( (x(1 -x)) +1 ) ] * [ derivative of sqrt(x(1 -x)) ]

Wait, derivative of sinh^{-1}(z) is 1 / sqrt(z² +1) * dz/dx. Here, z = sqrt(x(1 -x)). So dz/dx = (1 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(x(1 -x))). Therefore,

du/dx = [1 / sqrt(z² +1)] * (1 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(x(1 -x))) )

But z² = x(1 -x), so z² +1 = x(1 -x) +1 = 1 + x -x². Therefore,

du/dx = (1 - 2x) / [2 sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ]

Therefore, J = - ∫₀¹ x * (1 - 2x) / [2 sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Simplify the integrand:

- (1/2) ∫₀¹ [x(1 - 2x)] / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Let me write x(1 - 2x) as x - 2x². So:

- (1/2) ∫₀¹ (x - 2x²) / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can split the numerator:

= - (1/2) [ ∫₀¹ x / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx - 2 ∫₀¹ x² / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx ]

Simplify each integral:

First integral: ∫ x / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Let me factor sqrt(x) from sqrt(x(1 -x)):

sqrt(x(1 -x)) = sqrt(x) sqrt(1 -x). So:

First integral becomes ∫ x / [sqrt(x) sqrt(1 -x) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx = ∫ sqrt(x) / [sqrt(1 -x) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Similarly, second integral:

2 ∫ x² / [sqrt(x(1 -x)) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx = 2 ∫ x^(3/2) / [sqrt(1 -x) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

Not sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution. Let me consider substitution for the term 1 + x -x². Let me compute 1 + x -x² = -x² +x +1. The quadratic equation, roots at x = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 +4) ] / (-2) = [ -1 ± sqrt(5) ] / (-2). Not sure. Alternatively, complete the square:

1 + x -x² = -x² +x +1 = - (x² -x -1) = - [x² -x + (1/4) - (5/4)] = - [ (x - 1/2)^2 - 5/4 ] = - (x -1/2)^2 + 5/4 = 5/4 - (x -1/2)^2

So 1 + x -x² = 5/4 - (x -1/2)^2. So sqrt(1 + x -x²) = sqrt(5/4 - (x -1/2)^2). This looks like the equation of a circle with radius sqrt(5)/2 centered at x=1/2. So maybe a trigonometric substitution here. Let me set x -1/2 = (sqrt(5)/2) sinθ. Then, dx = (sqrt(5)/2) cosθ dθ. Then, sqrt(5/4 - (x -1/2)^2) = sqrt(5/4 - (5/4 sin²θ)) = (sqrt(5)/2) cosθ. Let's try this substitution for the first integral.

First integral: ∫ sqrt(x) / [sqrt(1 -x) sqrt(1 + x -x²) ] dx

With substitution x =1/2 + (sqrt(5)/2) sinθ. Then, when x=0, θ = arcsin( (-1/2) * 2/sqrt(5) ) = arcsin( -1/sqrt(5) ). Similarly, when x=1, θ = arcsin( (1/2) * 2/sqrt(5) ) = arcsin(1/sqrt(5)). This might complicate the limits, but maybe manageable.

But this seems very involved. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or a symmetry I'm missing. Let me think again.

Wait, going back to the original integral I = ∫₀¹ x ln(sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x))) dx. We found that I = J/2, where J = ∫₀¹ ln(sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 + x(1 -x))) dx. Maybe there's a way to compute J directly.

Alternatively, consider that the expression inside the log is sqrt(a) + sqrt(1 + a), which we related to sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)). So J = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)) dx, where a = x(1 -x). Maybe integrating sinh^{-1}(sqrt(a)) over x from 0 to1.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiate under the integral sign. Let me consider a parameterization. Let’s set J(b) = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(b x(1 -x))) dx. Then, our J is J(1). Compute J’(b) = ∫₀¹ [ derivative w.r. to b of sinh^{-1}(sqrt(b x(1 -x))) ] dx. The derivative of sinh^{-1}(z) with respect to z is 1/sqrt(z² +1). So derivative w.r. to b is [1 / sqrt(b x(1 -x) +1)] * (x(1 -x))/(2 sqrt(b x(1 -x))). Therefore,

J’(b) = ∫₀¹ [x(1 -x) / (2 sqrt(b x(1 -x)) sqrt(b x(1 -x) +1))] dx

Simplify:

= (1/2) ∫₀¹ sqrt(x(1 -x)) / sqrt(b x(1 -x) +1) dx

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe set t = x(1 -x). Then, but x(1 -x) is a quadratic function, so substitution might not be straightforward. Alternatively, for b=1, J’(1) = (1/2) ∫₀¹ sqrt(x(1 -x)) / sqrt(x(1 -x) +1) dx. Which is similar to the integral we had before. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe change variables to t = sqrt(x(1 -x)). Let me try that. Let t = sqrt(x(1 -x)). Then, t² = x -x². So x² -x + t² =0. Solving for x: x = [1 ± sqrt(1 -4t²)] / 2. But this complicates the limits. When x from 0 to1, t goes from 0 to 1/2 (since maximum of x(1 -x) is at x=1/2, t=1/2). So maybe split the integral into two parts from 0 to1/2 and 1/2 to1, but due to symmetry, it's the same. So t ranges from 0 to1/2. Then, dx = derivative of x with respect to t. But since x = [1 ± sqrt(1 -4t²)] / 2, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, use substitution t = x -1/2, as before. Let me try that again. Let x = t +1/2. Then, dx = dt, and when x=0, t=-1/2; x=1, t=1/2. Then, x(1 -x) = (1/2 + t)(1/2 - t) =1/4 - t². So J = ∫_{-1/2}^{1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) dt. Since the integrand is even, J = 2 ∫₀^{1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) dt. Let me set u = t. Then, t from 0 to1/2. Let me set u = (1/2) sinθ. Then, when t=0, θ=0; t=1/2, θ=π/2. Then, sqrt(1/4 - t²) = sqrt(1/4 - (1/4) sin²θ) = (1/2) sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = (1/2) cosθ. Then, sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) = sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ). Then, dt = (1/2) cosθ dθ. So J becomes 2 * ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) * (1/2) cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) cosθ dθ.

Hmm, this seems like a difficult integral, but maybe integrating by parts. Let me set u = sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ), dv = cosθ dθ. Then, du = [1 / sqrt( ( (1/2 cosθ )² +1 ) ] * (-1/2 sinθ ) dθ. And v = sinθ. So integration by parts gives:

uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v du

= [ sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) sinθ ] from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ * [ -1/(2 sqrt( (1/4 cos²θ ) +1 )) sinθ ] dθ

Evaluate the first term:

At θ=π/2, cosθ=0, so sinh^{-1}(0) =0, multiplied by sin(π/2)=1: 0.

At θ=0, cosθ=1, sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1 +1/4)) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(5)/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). So the term is sinh^{-1}(1/2) * 0 =0. So the first term is 0 -0=0.

Therefore, J = - ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ * [ -1/(2 sqrt(1/4 cos²θ +1 )) sinθ ] dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / sqrt(1/4 cos²θ +1 ) ] dθ

Simplify the denominator:

sqrt(1/4 cos²θ +1 ) = sqrt( (cos²θ +4)/4 ) = sqrt(cos²θ +4)/2. Therefore,

J = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / (sqrt(cos²θ +4)/2) ] dθ = (1/2) *2) ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / sqrt(cos²θ +4) ] dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / sqrt(cos²θ +4) ] dθ

Hmm, this integral. Let me consider substitution. Let’s set u = cosθ. Then, du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫₁⁰ [ (1 - u²) / sqrt(u² +4) ] (-du) = ∫₀¹ [ (1 - u²) / sqrt(u² +4) ] du

So J = ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)/sqrt(u² +4) du

This seems more manageable. Let's compute this integral:

∫₀¹ (1 - u²)/sqrt(u² +4) du

Split into two terms:

= ∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(u² +4) du - ∫₀¹ u²/sqrt(u² +4) du

First integral: ∫ 1/sqrt(u² +4) du = sinh^{-1}(u/2) + C. Evaluated from 0 to1: sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1/4 +1)) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )

Second integral: ∫ u²/sqrt(u² +4) du. Let me compute this integral. Let’s set w = u² +4, then dw = 2u du. Not helpful. Alternatively, use substitution u = 2 sinhφ. Then, sqrt(u² +4) = 2 coshφ, du = 2 coshφ dφ. Then, the second integral becomes ∫ (4 sinh²φ) / (2 coshφ) * 2 coshφ dφ = ∫ 4 sinh²φ dφ. Wait, let's compute step by step:

Set u = 2 sinhφ, so when u=0, φ=0; u=1, φ= sinh^{-1}(1/2). Then, sqrt(u² +4) = sqrt(4 sinh²φ +4) = 2 coshφ. du = 2 coshφ dφ. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} ( (4 sinh²φ) / (2 coshφ) ) * 2 coshφ dφ = ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} 4 sinh²φ dφ

Simplify:

= 4 ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} sinh²φ dφ

Using identity sinh²φ = (cosh(2φ) -1)/2:

= 4 * [ (1/2) ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} (cosh(2φ) -1) dφ ] = 2 [ (1/2 sinh(2φ) - φ) ] from 0 to sinh^{-1}(1/2)

Compute sinh(2φ) = 2 sinhφ coshφ. At φ = sinh^{-1}(1/2), sinhφ =1/2, coshφ = sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2) = sqrt(5)/2. Therefore, sinh(2φ) = 2*(1/2)*(sqrt(5)/2) = sqrt(5)/2. So:

= 2 [ (1/2 * sqrt(5)/2 - sinh^{-1}(1/2)) - (0 -0) ] = 2 [ sqrt(5)/4 - sinh^{-1}(1/2) ]

Therefore, the second integral is sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2)

Putting back into J:

J = [ sinh^{-1}(1/2) ] - [ sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) ] = sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2 + 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) = 3 sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2

But sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2)) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Let me compute that:

sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )

Therefore, J = 3 ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/2

Therefore, since I = J /2, then:

I = (3/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/4

So that's the exact answer. Let me verify this result.

Wait, let's check the steps again. We had J = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx. Then, substitution led to J = 3 sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2. Then, I = J/2 = (3/2) sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/4. Since sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ), then substituting back:

I = (3/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/4

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute each term:

First, compute (1 + sqrt(5))/2:

sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2360679775

So (1 + 2.2360679775)/2 ≈ 3.2360679775 /2 ≈ 1.61803398875

ln(1.61803398875) ≈ 0.4812118255

Multiply by 3/2: 0.4812118255 * 1.5 ≈ 0.72181773825

Next, sqrt(5)/4 ≈ 2.2360679775 /4 ≈ 0.559016994375

Therefore, I ≈ 0.72181773825 - 0.559016994375 ≈ 0.162800743875

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.1628007439

But let me verify this calculation with more precise steps.

First, compute sinh^{-1}(1/2):

sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2)) = ln(0.5 + sqrt(1.25)) = ln(0.5 + 1.118033988749895) = ln(1.618033988749895) ≈ 0.4812118253596113

Then, 3/2 * 0.4812118253596113 ≈ 0.721817738039417

sqrt(5)/4 ≈ 2.23606797749979 /4 ≈ 0.5590169943749475

Subtract: 0.721817738039417 - 0.5590169943749475 ≈ 0.1628007436644695

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.1628007437

But let me check with a calculator for the integral. Let me compute the original integral numerically to verify.

Using numerical integration, say with Simpson's rule or using a calculator. Let's approximate ∫₀¹ x ln(sqrt(x(1 -x)) + sqrt(1 +x(1 -x))) dx.

Let me compute the integrand at several points:

At x=0: the integrand is 0 * ln(0 + sqrt(1 +0)) =0.

At x=0.5: x=0.5, x(1 -x)=0.25, sqrt(0.25)=0.5, sqrt(1 +0.25)=sqrt(1.25)=1.118034, sum=0.5 +1.118034=1.618034, ln(1.618034)=0.481212, multiplied by 0.5: 0.240606

At x=1: integrand is 1 * ln(0 + sqrt(1 +0))=1*0=0.

So the function starts at 0, peaks around x=0.5, and ends at 0. Using numerical integration with a few points:

Using Simpson's rule with n=2 intervals (x=0, 0.5,1):

Integral ≈ (1/6)[f(0) +4f(0.5) +f(1)] = (1/6)[0 +4*0.240606 +0] ≈ (0.962424)/6 ≈0.160404

But this is a rough estimate. For better accuracy, use more intervals. Let's use n=4 intervals, step h=0.25:

x=0: 0

x=0.25: x=0.25, x(1 -x)=0.1875, sqrt(0.1875)=0.433013, sqrt(1 +0.1875)=sqrt(1.1875)=1.089724, sum=0.433013+1.089724≈1.522737, ln(1.522737)≈0.420627, multiplied by 0.25:0.105157

x=0.5:0.240606

x=0.75: same as x=0.25 due to symmetry:0.105157

x=1:0

Simpson's rule with n=4:

Integral ≈ (0.25/3)[f(0) +4(f(0.25)+f(0.75)) +2f(0.5) +f(1)] = (0.25/3)[0 +4*(0.105157+0.105157) +2*0.240606 +0] = (0.25/3)[4*0.210314 +0.481212] = (0.25/3)[0.841256 +0.481212] = (0.25/3)(1.322468) ≈0.25*0.4408227≈0.1102057

Wait, this seems lower than previous estimate. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, Simpson's rule for n=4 (4 intervals, 5 points) is (h/3)[f0 +4f1 +2f2 +4f3 +f4], where h=0.25.

So:

h=0.25, so integral ≈ (0.25/3)[0 +4*(0.105157) +2*(0.240606) +4*(0.105157) +0] = (0.25/3)[0 +0.420628 +0.481212 +0.420628 +0] = (0.25/3)(1.322468) ≈0.25 *0.4408227≈0.1102057

But this is conflicting with the previous Simpson's rule with n=2 which gave 0.160404. This inconsistency suggests that the function is not well-approximated by low-order methods. Therefore, perhaps a better numerical approximation is needed. Alternatively, use higher n.

Alternatively, use a calculator or computational tool. But since I need to compute this manually, let's try with n=8 intervals, h=0.125.

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, accept that the analytical result is I = (3/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/4 ≈0.1628007437.

But let's compute this exact expression numerically with high precision.

First, compute (1 + sqrt(5))/2:

sqrt(5) ≈2.2360679775

(1 + 2.2360679775)/2 ≈3.2360679775/2≈1.61803398875

ln(1.61803398875) ≈0.4812118255

Multiply by 3/2:0.4812118255 *1.5≈0.72181773825

sqrt(5)/4≈2.2360679775/4≈0.559016994375

Subtract:0.72181773825 -0.559016994375≈0.162800743875

Rounded to 10 decimal places:0.1628007439

But earlier manual Simpson's with n=4 gave 0.1102, which is different. This suggests a mistake in the analytical solution. Wait, but where?

Wait, let's check the steps again. When we did the substitution for J, we ended up with J = 3 sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2. Then I = J/2. But sinh^{-1}(1/2) is ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ), which is approximately 0.481212. So 3*0.481212≈1.443636, subtract sqrt(5)/2≈1.118034, so J≈1.443636 -1.118034≈0.325602. Then I=0.325602/2≈0.162801, which matches the earlier result. But the numerical approximation using Simpson's rule with n=4 gave 0.1102, which is significantly different. This suggests that there's an error in the analytical solution.

Wait, but where could the mistake be? Let's trace back.

When we computed J = ∫₀¹ sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(1 -x))) dx, we did substitution x = t +1/2, leading to J = 2 ∫₀^{1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(1/4 - t²)) dt. Then, substitution t = (1/2) sinθ, leading to J = ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}( (1/2) cosθ ) cosθ dθ. Then, integration by parts led to J = ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / sqrt(cos²θ +4) ] dθ. Then, substitution u = cosθ, leading to J = ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)/sqrt(u² +4) du. Then, computed as sinh^{-1}(1/2) - [ sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) ] = 3 sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2.

Wait, let's verify the step where we did substitution u = cosθ. The integral after substitution was:

J = ∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / sqrt(cos²θ +4) ] dθ

With u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ. When θ=0, u=1; θ=π/2, u=0. Then, sinθ = sqrt(1 -u²). Therefore, sin²θ =1 -u². Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₁⁰ [ (1 -u²) / sqrt(u² +4) ] * (-du) = ∫₀¹ (1 -u²)/sqrt(u² +4) du

Yes, that's correct. Then, splitting into two integrals:

∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(u² +4) du - ∫₀¹ u²/sqrt(u² +4) du

First integral is sinh^{-1}(u/2) from 0 to1: sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(1/2)

Second integral: ∫₀¹ u²/sqrt(u² +4) du. We used substitution u =2 sinhφ. Let me check that again.

Set u =2 sinhφ, so when u=0, φ=0; u=1, φ= sinh^{-1}(1/2). Then, sqrt(u² +4)=2 coshφ, du=2 coshφ dφ. Then, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} (4 sinh²φ) / (2 coshφ) * 2 coshφ dφ = ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} 4 sinh²φ dφ

Yes, this is correct. Then, using identity sinh²φ = (cosh(2φ) -1)/2:

=4 ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} (cosh(2φ) -1)/2 dφ =2 ∫₀^{sinh^{-1}(1/2)} (cosh(2φ) -1) dφ

=2 [ (1/2 sinh(2φ) -φ) ] from 0 to sinh^{-1}(1/2)

At sinh^{-1}(1/2), φ= sinh^{-1}(1/2). Let’s compute sinh(2φ):

sinh(2φ) =2 sinhφ coshφ. Since sinhφ=1/2, coshφ= sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2)=sqrt(5)/2. Therefore, sinh(2φ)=2*(1/2)*(sqrt(5)/2)=sqrt(5)/2.

Therefore, the evaluated integral is:

2 [ (1/2 * sqrt(5)/2 - sinh^{-1}(1/2)) - (0 -0) ] =2 [ sqrt(5)/4 - sinh^{-1}(1/2) ] = sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2)

Therefore, the second integral is sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2)

Therefore, J = sinh^{-1}(1/2) - ( sqrt(5)/2 - 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) ) = sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2 + 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) =3 sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/2

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, I = J/2 = (3/2) sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sqrt(5)/4

Therefore, the analytical solution is correct. The discrepancy with the numerical approximation must be due to the low number of intervals used in Simpson's rule. Let's try a better numerical approximation.

Alternatively, use the exact expression to compute the numerical value:

(3/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/4

Compute each term:

First term: (3/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )

Compute (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1 +2.2360679775)/2 ≈1.61803398875

ln(1.61803398875) ≈0.4812118255

Multiply by 3/2:0.4812118255 *1.5≈0.72181773825

Second term: sqrt(5)/4 ≈2.2360679775/4≈0.559016994375

Subtract:0.72181773825 -0.559016994375≈0.162800743875

Rounded to 10 decimal places:0.1628007439

Therefore, the exact answer is (3/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - sqrt(5)/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1628007439.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact answer: \boxed{\frac{3}{2} \ln\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}}
