Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to infinity of [1/(x(x² + 1²))] * arctan[(1 * x)/(x² + 1²)] dx. Hmm, let me first write that down properly to make sure I have the integrand right. The integrand is (1/(x(x² + 1))) * arctan(x/(x² + 1)). Wait, the original problem has 1² in the denominator, which is just 1, so that's x² +1. And the argument of the arctan is (1 * x)/(x² +1²), which simplifies to x/(x² +1). So the integral is ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. 

First, I need to think about how to approach this integral. The presence of arctan suggests that maybe a substitution could be useful here. Alternatively, perhaps integration by parts. Let me see. Let's consider substitution first. Let me look at the argument of the arctan: x/(x² +1). Maybe if I set t = x/(x² +1), but I'm not sure if that would help. Alternatively, maybe a substitution that simplifies the denominator x(x² +1). Let's see, the denominator is x times (x² +1), so maybe partial fractions? But partial fractions on 1/(x(x² +1)) would split into A/x + (Bx + C)/(x² +1). Let me check that. 1/(x(x² +1)) = A/x + (Bx + C)/(x² +1). Multiply both sides by x(x² +1):

1 = A(x² +1) + (Bx + C)x

Expanding the right side: A x² + A + B x² + C x

Combine like terms: (A + B)x² + C x + A

Set coefficients equal on both sides (left side is 1, which is 0x² +0x +1):

So, A + B = 0

C = 0

A = 1

Therefore, A =1, B = -1, C=0. So partial fractions decomposition is 1/x - x/(x² +1). So the integrand becomes [1/x - x/(x² +1)] * arctan(x/(x² +1)). Hmm, so the integral can be split into two parts: ∫ [1/x * arctan(x/(x² +1))] dx - ∫ [x/(x² +1) * arctan(x/(x² +1))] dx. Maybe this helps. Let's denote the integral as I = I1 - I2, where I1 is the first integral and I2 the second.

But integrating from 0 to infinity. Let me check if substitution can be applied here. Let's consider substitution for the arctan term. Let me set t = x/(x² +1). Then, perhaps we can express the integral in terms of t. Let's compute dt/dx. 

dt/dx = [ (1)(x² +1) - x(2x) ] / (x² +1)^2 = [x² +1 - 2x²]/(x² +1)^2 = (1 - x²)/(x² +1)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe substitution for x. Let me try substitution x = tanθ. Since x is from 0 to infinity, θ would go from 0 to π/2. Let's try that. Let x = tanθ, so dx = sec²θ dθ. Then x² +1 = tan²θ +1 = sec²θ. Let's substitute into the integrand.

First, the denominator x(x² +1) becomes tanθ * sec²θ. The arctan term is arctan( x/(x² +1) ) = arctan( tanθ / sec²θ ) = arctan( (sinθ/cosθ) / (1/cos²θ) ) = arctan( sinθ cosθ ). Because tanθ / sec²θ = (sinθ/cosθ) / (1/cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ. So arctan(sinθ cosθ). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me compute sinθ cosθ. That's (1/2) sin(2θ). So arctan( (1/2) sin(2θ) ). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let me see. So the integrand becomes [1/(tanθ * sec²θ)] * arctan( (1/2) sin(2θ) ) * sec²θ dθ. Wait, the original integrand is [1/(x(x² +1))] * arctan(...) dx. Substituting x = tanθ, dx = sec²θ dθ. So:

x(x² +1) = tanθ * sec²θ. Therefore, 1/(x(x² +1)) dx becomes 1/(tanθ * sec²θ) * sec²θ dθ = 1/tanθ dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ [1/tanθ] * arctan( (1/2) sin(2θ) ) dθ, with θ from 0 to π/2. So that's ∫ (cotθ) arctan( (1/2) sin(2θ) ) dθ. Hmm, maybe this is a better form? Let's see. Let me check the substitution. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let's consider integrating by parts for I1 and I2. Let's take I1 first: ∫ [1/x] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Let u = arctan(x/(x² +1)), dv = (1/x) dx. Then du would be derivative of arctan(u) times derivative of the argument. Let me compute du. Let me set u = arctan(y), where y = x/(x² +1). Then du/dx = [1/(1 + y²)] * dy/dx. Compute dy/dx: dy/dx = [ (1)(x² +1) - x(2x) ] / (x² +1)^2 = (x² +1 - 2x²)/(x² +1)^2 = (1 - x²)/(x² +1)^2. So du = [1/(1 + y²)] * (1 - x²)/(x² +1)^2 dx. But y = x/(x² +1), so 1 + y² = 1 + x²/(x² +1)^2 = [ (x² +1)^2 + x² ] / (x² +1)^2. Let me compute that: (x² +1)^2 + x² = x^4 + 2x² +1 + x² = x^4 +3x² +1. So 1 + y² = (x^4 +3x² +1)/(x² +1)^2. Therefore, du = [ (x² +1)^2 / (x^4 +3x² +1) ) ] * (1 - x²)/(x² +1)^2 dx = (1 - x²)/(x^4 +3x² +1) dx. So du = (1 - x²)/(x^4 +3x² +1) dx. And dv = (1/x) dx, so v = ln|x|. Therefore, integration by parts gives u*v - ∫ v*du. So I1 = arctan(x/(x² +1)) * lnx | from 0 to ∞ - ∫ lnx * (1 - x²)/(x^4 +3x² +1) dx. Hmm, this seems complicated, especially evaluating the boundary terms. Let me check the limits. As x approaches infinity, arctan(x/(x² +1)) approaches arctan(0) since x/(x² +1) ~ 1/x → 0. So arctan(0) is 0. And lnx approaches infinity. So we have 0 * infinity, which is indeterminate. Similarly, as x approaches 0 from the right, arctan(x/(x² +1)) ~ arctan(x) ~ x, so x * lnx approaches 0. So the boundary term might be 0 - 0 = 0? Wait, but let me check more carefully. Let me compute the limit as x approaches infinity of arctan(x/(x² +1)) * lnx. Let me approximate x/(x² +1) for large x: x/(x² +1) ≈ 1/x. So arctan(1/x) ≈ 1/x for large x. So arctan(1/x) * lnx ≈ (1/x) * lnx. As x approaches infinity, this tends to 0. So the product is 0. At x approaching 0+, arctan(x/(x² +1)) ≈ arctan(x) ≈ x. So x * lnx approaches 0 (since lnx approaches -infty, but x approaches 0, so x lnx → 0). Therefore, the boundary term is 0. So I1 = - ∫₀^∞ lnx * (1 - x²)/(x^4 +3x² +1) dx. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe this approach is not the best way. Let me think about another substitution.

Alternatively, maybe consider symmetry or substitution x = 1/t. Let me try substitution t = 1/x. Then when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. So dx = -1/t² dt. Let's substitute into the original integral:

∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx = ∫∞^0 [1/( (1/t)( (1/t²) +1 ))] arctan( (1/t)/( (1/t²) +1 )) * (-1/t²) dt. Simplify the integral:

= ∫₀^∞ [ t / (1 + t²)/t² ) ] arctan( (1/t)/( (1 + t²)/t² )) * (1/t²) dt

Wait, let's compute the denominator x(x² +1) when x =1/t:

x(x² +1) = (1/t)(1/t² +1) = (1/t)( (1 + t²)/t² ) = (1 + t²)/t^3.

So 1/(x(x² +1)) = t^3/(1 + t²).

The arctan term: x/(x² +1) = (1/t)/( (1/t²) +1 ) = (1/t)/( (1 + t²)/t² ) = t/(1 + t²).

So arctan(t/(1 + t²)).

So the integrand becomes [ t^3/(1 + t²) ] * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) * (1/t²) dt. Because dx = -1/t² dt, and the negative sign flips the limits, so the integrand becomes positive. So:

[ t^3/(1 + t²) ] * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) * (1/t²) dt = [ t/(1 + t²) ] * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) dt.

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ t/(1 + t²) ] arctan(t/(1 + t²)) dt. But this is the same as the original integral but with x replaced by t. Wait, but the original integral was ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. After substitution, we get ∫₀^∞ [ t/(1 + t²) ] arctan(t/(1 + t²)) dt. Wait, but the original integrand is [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)), and after substitution, it's [t/(1 + t²)] arctan(t/(1 + t²)). So these are different. Therefore, the substitution x =1/t gives another integral. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then, after substitution, I = ∫₀^∞ [ t/(1 + t²) ] arctan(t/(1 + t²)) dt. So we have I = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx and also I = ∫₀^∞ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no, the substitution gives I = ∫₀^∞ [t/(t² +1)] arctan(t/(t² +1)) dt. So if we denote that as J, then J = ∫₀^∞ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. So the original integral I is equal to J. But the original I is ∫ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(...) dx, and J is ∫ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx. So I and J are different. Wait, but according to substitution, I = J. Wait, but that would mean that I = J, but I is ∫ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(...) dx and J is ∫ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx. So unless there's a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.

Original substitution: x =1/t, so dx = -1/t² dt. The original integrand is [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Substitute x =1/t:

1/(x(x² +1)) = 1/ [ (1/t)(1/t² +1) ) ] = 1/ [ (1/t)( (1 + t²)/t² ) ] = 1/ [ (1 + t²)/t^3 ] = t^3/(1 + t²).

arctan(x/(x² +1)) = arctan( (1/t)/( (1/t²) +1 )) = arctan( (1/t)/( (1 + t²)/t² )) = arctan( t/(1 + t²) ).

dx = -1/t² dt. So the integrand becomes t^3/(1 + t²) * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) * (-1/t²) dt. The negative sign flips the limits, so integral from ∞ to 0 becomes 0 to ∞. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ t^3/(1 + t²) * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) * (1/t²) ] dt = ∫₀^∞ [ t/(1 + t²) * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) ] dt. So yes, I = ∫₀^∞ [ t/(1 + t²) * arctan(t/(1 + t²)) ] dt. So I = J, where J is ∫₀^∞ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. So now, we have two expressions for I: the original one and J. So if we add them together, I + J = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1)) + x/(x² +1)] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Let's compute the sum inside the integral:

1/(x(x² +1)) + x/(x² +1) = [1 + x²]/(x(x² +1)) = (x² +1)/(x(x² +1)) = 1/x. So I + J = ∫₀^∞ (1/x) arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. But wait, that's just I1 from before. Wait, but I1 was part of the original integral. Wait, but according to partial fractions, the original integrand was split into I1 - I2. But now, we have I = I1 - I2, and J = I2. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The original integral I is ∫ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(...) dx = I1 - I2, where I1 = ∫ [1/x] arctan(...) dx and I2 = ∫ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx. But from substitution, we found that I = J = I2. Therefore, I = I2. But according to partial fractions, I = I1 - I2. Therefore, substituting I = I2 into that equation gives I2 = I1 - I2 → 2I2 = I1 → I1 = 2I2. So if we can compute I1 or I2, we can find the value. But this seems a bit circular. Maybe there's another way. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me see. Let's consider a parameter in the integral. For example, let me define I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +a²))] arctan( (a x)/(x² +a²) ) dx. Then, perhaps differentiating I(a) with respect to a could lead to a solvable differential equation. But the original problem has a=1. Let me try this approach. Let me set a general a and then set a=1 at the end. So I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +a²))] arctan( (a x)/(x² +a²) ) dx. Let me compute dI/da. 

First, note that the integrand is [1/(x(x² +a²))] arctan( (a x)/(x² +a²) ). Let me compute the derivative with respect to a. Let me denote the integrand as f(x,a). Then dI/da = ∫₀^∞ [ ∂f/∂a ] dx. Let's compute ∂f/∂a:

First, f(x,a) = [1/(x(x² +a²))] arctan( (a x)/(x² +a²) )

So derivative with respect to a:

First term: derivative of [1/(x(x² +a²))] with respect to a. Since x is independent of a, this is [1/x] * derivative of 1/(x² +a²) with respect to a. Which is [1/x] * (-2a)/(x² +a²)^2.

Second term: derivative of arctan( (a x)/(x² +a²) ) with respect to a. Let me compute that. Let y = (a x)/(x² +a²). Then dy/da = [x(x² +a²) - a x * 2a ] / (x² +a²)^2 = [x(x² +a²) - 2a² x ] / (x² +a²)^2 = x[ x² +a² - 2a² ] / (x² +a²)^2 = x(x² -a²)/(x² +a²)^2. Then derivative of arctan(y) with respect to a is [1/(1 + y²)] * dy/da. So [1/(1 + (a² x²)/(x² +a²)^2 )] * [x(x² -a²)/(x² +a²)^2]. Let me compute 1 + y² = 1 + (a² x²)/(x² +a²)^2 = [ (x² +a²)^2 + a² x² ] / (x² +a²)^2. The numerator is x^4 + 2a² x² +a^4 +a² x² = x^4 +3a² x² +a^4. So 1 + y² = (x^4 +3a² x² +a^4)/(x² +a²)^2. Therefore, the derivative of arctan(y) is [ (x² +a²)^2 / (x^4 +3a² x² +a^4) ) ] * [x(x² -a²)/(x² +a²)^2 ] = x(x² -a²)/(x^4 +3a² x² +a^4). 

Putting it all together, the derivative ∂f/∂a is:

[ -2a/(x(x² +a²)^2) ) ] * arctan(y) + [1/(x(x² +a²))] * [x(x² -a²)/(x^4 +3a² x² +a^4) ]

Simplify each part:

First term: -2a/(x(x² +a²)^2) * arctan(y)

Second term: [1/(x(x² +a²))] * x(x² -a²)/(x^4 +3a² x² +a^4) = (x² -a²)/[ (x² +a²)(x^4 +3a² x² +a^4) ]

So dI/da = ∫₀^∞ [ -2a/(x(x² +a²)^2) * arctan(y) + (x² -a²)/[ (x² +a²)(x^4 +3a² x² +a^4) ] ] dx

This seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach is not helpful. Let me think of another substitution.

Wait, going back to the substitution x = tanθ. Let me try that again. So x = tanθ, θ from 0 to π/2. Then dx = sec²θ dθ. The denominator x(x² +1) = tanθ * sec²θ. The arctan term is arctan( x/(x² +1) ) = arctan( tanθ / sec²θ ) = arctan( sinθ cosθ ). As before. So the integrand becomes [1/(tanθ * sec²θ)] * arctan(sinθ cosθ) * sec²θ dθ = [1/tanθ] * arctan(sinθ cosθ) dθ. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Because sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ. So arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ). Let me denote φ = 2θ, so when θ goes from 0 to π/2, φ goes from 0 to π. But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe substitution t = θ. Let me think. Let me consider the integral ∫₀^{π/2} cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Let me make substitution t = 2θ. Then θ = t/2, dθ = dt/2. When θ=0, t=0; θ=π/2, t=π. So the integral becomes ∫₀^π cot(t/2) arctan( (1/2) sin t ) * (dt/2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe integrate by parts here. Let me set u = arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ), dv = cotθ dθ. Then du = [1/(1 + ( (1/2 sin2θ )^2 ))] * (1/2) * 2 cos2θ dθ = [1/(1 + (1/4 sin²2θ))] * cos2θ dθ. Wait, derivative of (1/2 sin2θ) with respect to θ is (1/2)*2 cos2θ = cos2θ. So du = [1/(1 + ( (1/2 sin2θ )^2 ))] * cos2θ dθ. And dv = cotθ dθ. The integral of cotθ dθ is ln|sinθ| + C. So integration by parts gives:

uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫ v du. So:

= [ arctan( (1/2 sin2θ ) ) * ln sinθ ] from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} ln sinθ * [ cos2θ / (1 + (1/4 sin²2θ )) ] dθ.

Let me evaluate the boundary term first. At θ=π/2: sinθ =1, sin2θ = sinπ=0, so arctan(0)=0. So term is 0 * ln1 =0. At θ=0: sinθ=0, ln sinθ approaches -infty, but arctan(0)=0. So 0 * (-infty) which is 0. So the boundary term is 0. Therefore, the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/2} ln sinθ * [ cos2θ / (1 + (1/4 sin²2θ )) ] dθ. Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe this is not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding the arctan term into a series. Since arctan(z) can be expressed as a power series for |z| ≤1. Let me check the argument of arctan: x/(x² +1). For x ≥0, x/(x² +1) ≤ 1/2, since maximum occurs at x=1, where 1/(1 +1) =1/2. So the argument is always between 0 and 1/2. Therefore, the power series for arctan(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1), which converges for |z| ≤1. So we can write arctan(x/(x² +1)) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n [x/(x² +1)]^{2n+1}/(2n+1). Then, the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] [x/(x² +1)]^{2n+1} dx. Simplify the integrand: [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x^{2n+1}/(x² +1)^{2n+1}] = x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2}. So the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx. Let me compute the integral ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx. Let me make substitution t = x², so dt = 2x dx, x = sqrt(t), dx = dt/(2 sqrt(t)). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^n / (t +1)^{2n+2} * dt/(2 sqrt(t)) ) = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ t^{n -1/2}/(t +1)^{2n+2} dt. This is a standard Beta function integral. Recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{c -1}/(1 + t)^{c + d} dt = B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). In our case, c = n +1/2, d = (2n +2) - (n +1/2) = n + 3/2. Therefore, the integral is (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = (1/2) [ Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2) ] / Γ(2n +2). 

We know that Γ(n +1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π)/4^n n! and Γ(n +3/2) = (2n +2)! sqrt(π)/4^{n +1} (n +1)! ). Wait, let me recall the properties of the Gamma function. Γ(n +1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π)/4^n n! for integer n. Similarly, Γ(n +3/2) = Γ( (n +1) +1/2 ) = (2(n +1))! sqrt(π)/4^{n +1} (n +1)! ). Therefore, Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2) = [ (2n)! sqrt(π)/4^n n! ) ] * [ (2n +2)! sqrt(π)/4^{n +1} (n +1)! ) ] = π (2n)! (2n +2)! ) / (4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! ) ). Then Γ(2n +2) = (2n +1)! ). So the Beta function becomes:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = [ Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2) ] / Γ(2n +2) = [ π (2n)! (2n +2)! ) / (4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! ) ) ] / (2n +1)! ) = π² (2n)! (2n +2)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ].

Simplify this expression. Let's note that (2n +2)! = (2n +2)(2n +1)(2n)! ). So:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = π² (2n)! * (2n +2)(2n +1)(2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: π² (2n)!^2 (2n +2)(2n +1)

Denominator: 4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! )

But (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)! ), so denominator becomes 4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)(2n)! )

Cancel out (2n)! from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: π² (2n)! (2n +2)(2n +1)

Denominator: 4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1) )

Cancel (2n +1):

Numerator: π² (2n)! (2n +2)

Denominator:4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! )

Note that (2n +2) = 2(n +1), so:

Numerator: π² (2n)! * 2(n +1)

Denominator:4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! )

Simplify 2(n +1)/ (n +1)! ) = 2/(n! )

Wait, (n +1)! = (n +1) n! ), so 2(n +1)/ (n +1)! ) = 2/(n! )

Therefore, numerator becomes π² (2n)! * 2 /n! )

Denominator:4^{2n +1} n! )

So overall:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = π² (2n)! * 2 /n! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! ) ] = 2 π² (2n)! / (n! )^2 ) / 4^{2n +1} )

Wait, 4^{2n +1} = 4 * 16^n. So:

= 2 π² (2n)! / (n! )^2 ) / (4 * 16^n ) ) = (2 π² /4 ) (2n)! / (n! )^2 ) / 16^n ) = (π² /2 ) (2n)! / (n! )^2 ) / 16^n )

But (2n)! / (n! )^2 ) is the central binomial coefficient, which is C(2n, n). So:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = (π² /2 ) C(2n, n) / 16^n )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n +2} dx = (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = (1/2) * (π² /2 ) C(2n, n) / 16^n ) = π² /4 * C(2n, n)/16^n.

Therefore, the original series becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * π² /4 * C(2n, n)/16^n.

So I = π² /4 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * C(2n, n)/16^n.

Hmm, this series might be related to some known series. Let me recall that the generating function for central binomial coefficients is Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) x^n = 1/sqrt(1 -4x). But here we have alternating terms and divided by 16^n and multiplied by 1/(2n+1). Let me see. Let me write the sum as Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n C(2n, n) / (16^n (2n +1)) ].

Let me consider the sum S = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n C(2n, n) / (16^n (2n +1)) ].

Let me recall that ∫₀^1 t^{2n} dt = 1/(2n +1). So S = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n C(2n, n)/16^n ] ∫₀^1 t^{2n} dt = ∫₀^1 Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) (-t²/16)^n dt.

The sum inside is Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) (-t²/16)^n = 1/sqrt(1 +4*(t²/16)) ) = 1/sqrt(1 + t²/4 ) = 2/sqrt(4 + t²). Because the generating function is Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) x^n = 1/sqrt(1 -4x). So replacing x with -t²/16, we get 1/sqrt(1 -4*(-t²/16)) = 1/sqrt(1 + t²/4) = 2/sqrt(4 + t²). Therefore, S = ∫₀^1 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt.

Compute this integral: ∫ 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt. Let me make substitution u = t/2, but actually, standard integral ∫1/sqrt(a² + t²) dt = sinh^{-1}(t/a) + C. So here, a=2. Therefore, ∫ 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt = 2 sinh^{-1}(t/2) + C. Evaluated from 0 to1: 2[ sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sinh^{-1}(0) ] = 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). Since sinh^{-1}(0) =0. Now, sinh^{-1}(z) = ln(z + sqrt(z² +1)). So sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1/4 +1)) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(5)/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, interestingly, this is the natural logarithm of the golden ratio. So S = 2 ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, the original integral I = π² /4 * S = π² /4 * 2 ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) = π²/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ).

But wait, let me check the steps again. The sum S was equal to ∫₀^1 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt = 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). So S = 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). Therefore, I = π² /4 * S = π² /4 * 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) = π²/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2). But sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, I = (π²/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). 

But let me verify this result. Let me compute sinh^{-1}(1/2). As above, sinh^{-1}(x) = ln(x + sqrt(x² +1)). So sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(1/4 +1)) = ln(1/2 + sqrt(5)/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). So yes. Therefore, the integral I is (π²/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). 

But wait, let me check the steps again. The original integral I was expressed as a series, which led to I = π²/4 * S, where S = 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). Therefore, I = π²/4 * 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) = π²/2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). Which is equal to π²/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). 

But let me check if this answer makes sense. Let me compute the numerical value. Let's compute (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1 +2.236067977)/2 ≈ 1.6180339885. Then ln(1.6180339885) ≈ 0.4812118255. Then multiply by π²/2. π² ≈9.8696044, so 9.8696044 /2 ≈4.9348022. Then 4.9348022 * 0.4812118255 ≈ 2.374... Let me compute this more accurately. Let's compute ln((1 + sqrt(5))/2):

sqrt(5) ≈2.2360679775

1 + sqrt(5) ≈3.2360679775

Divide by 2: 1.61803398875

ln(1.61803398875) ≈0.481211825359

π²/2 ≈4.8696044

Wait, π² is approximately 9.8696044, so π²/2 is approximately 4.9348022.

Multiply 4.9348022 * 0.481211825359 ≈ 4.9348022 *0.481211825359 ≈

4.9348022 *0.4 =1.97392088

4.9348022 *0.08 =0.394784176

4.9348022 *0.001211825359 ≈0.005975

Adding up: 1.97392088 +0.394784176=2.368705056 +0.005975≈2.37468. So approximately 2.37468. Let me check with numerical integration. Let me approximate the original integral numerically. Let's compute ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Let me use substitution x from 0 to infinity. Let me split the integral into two parts: from 0 to1 and from1 to infinity. For the second part, use substitution x=1/t. So the integral becomes ∫₀^1 [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx + ∫₀^1 [t/(t² +1)] arctan(t/(t² +1)) dt. Which is 2 times ∫₀^1 [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. So compute numerically ∫₀^1 [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Let me approximate this integral using numerical methods. Let's take x from 0 to1. The integrand at x=0 is undefined, but the limit as x approaches 0 is arctan(0)/0, which is 0/0. Let's compute the limit using L’Hospital's Rule. Let x approach 0. arctan(x/(x² +1)) ~ x/(x² +1) ~x. So the integrand ~ (1/(x(x² +1))) *x ~1/(x² +1) →1. So the integrand approaches 1 as x→0. At x=1, the integrand is [1/(1*(1+1))] arctan(1/(1+1)) = (1/2) arctan(1/2) ≈ (1/2)(0.463647609) ≈0.2318238045. So the integrand is well-behaved. Let me approximate the integral from 0 to1 using Simpson's rule with, say, n=4 intervals. Let's take h=0.25. Compute the function at x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1.

At x=0: limit is 1, but since x=0 is a singularity, we can take a small epsilon, say x=0.0001. Compute f(0.0001)= [1/(0.0001*(0.0001² +1))] * arctan(0.0001/(0.0001² +1)) ≈ [1/(0.0001*1.00000001)] * arctan(0.0001) ≈ (10000) *0.0001 ≈1. So f(0)≈1.

At x=0.25: f(0.25)= [1/(0.25*(0.0625 +1))] * arctan(0.25/(0.0625 +1)) = [1/(0.25*1.0625)] * arctan(0.25/1.0625) = [1/0.265625] * arctan(0.2352941176) ≈3.764705882 *0.231823804 ≈0.873.

At x=0.5: f(0.5)= [1/(0.5*(0.25 +1))] * arctan(0.5/1.25) = [1/(0.5*1.25)] * arctan(0.4) = [1/0.625] *0.380506377 ≈1.6 *0.380506377≈0.60881.

At x=0.75: f(0.75)= [1/(0.75*(0.5625 +1))] * arctan(0.75/1.5625) = [1/(0.75*1.5625)] * arctan(0.48) ≈[1/1.171875] *0.44813195 ≈0.853 *0.44813195≈0.382.

At x=1: f(1)=0.2318238045 as before.

Using Simpson's rule: integral ≈ (h/3)[f(0) +4(f(0.25)+f(0.75)) +2(f(0.5)) +f(1)]

= (0.25/3)[1 +4*(0.873 +0.382) +2*(0.60881) +0.2318]

= (0.0833333)[1 +4*(1.255) +1.21762 +0.2318]

= (0.0833333)[1 +5.02 +1.21762 +0.2318]

= (0.0833333)(7.46942) ≈0.62245.

But this is only with n=4 intervals, which is not very accurate. Let's try with more intervals. Alternatively, use numerical integration tool. Alternatively, use approximate value from the analytical result. The analytical result was approximately 2.37468. Since the integral from 0 to1 is approximately 0.62245, then the total integral would be 2*0.62245≈1.2449, which is not matching the analytical result. So there must be a mistake in the analytical derivation. Wait, this suggests that the analytical result is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the steps.

Wait, let me check the series approach again. The original integral I was expressed as a series leading to I = π²/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). But according to the numerical check, this gives approximately 2.374, but the numerical approximation of the integral from 0 to1 is about 0.62245, and the total integral would be 2*0.62245≈1.2449, which is about half of the analytical result. Therefore, there must be an error in the analytical steps.

Let me retrace the steps. The series expansion: arctan(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n z^{2n+1}/(2n+1). Then the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx. Then, substitution t =x², leading to integral (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2). Then, using Gamma functions, leading to the expression involving central binomial coefficients. Then, expressing the sum as an integral, leading to S = ∫₀^1 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt = 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). Then, I = π²/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2). But according to the numerical check, this is not matching. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the series expansion. Let me check the step where I expressed the integral as a series. The integrand is [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)). When expanding arctan(x/(x² +1)) as a power series, we have to ensure convergence. But x/(x² +1) ≤1/2 for all x≥0, so the series converges. Then, the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/[x(x² +1)^{2n+2}] dx. Wait, the integrand after expansion is [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)]^{2n+1} = x^{2n+1}/[x(x² +1)^{2n+2}] = x^{2n}/ (x² +1)^{2n+2}. So the integral is ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx. Which is correct. Then substitution t =x², leading to (1/2) ∫₀^∞ t^{n -1/2}/(1 +t)^{2n+2} dt. Which is (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2). Then, using properties of the Beta function. Then, expressing in terms of Gamma functions. Then, simplifying to get the expression involving central binomial coefficients. Then, recognizing the sum as an integral. Then, evaluating the integral. But according to the numerical check, the analytical result is about 2.37, but the numerical approximation suggests around 1.24. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, there is a mistake in the analytical derivation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the step where I expressed the sum S as ∫₀^1 2/sqrt(4 + t²) dt. Let me check that again. The sum S was Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n C(2n, n) / (16^n (2n +1)) ] = ∫₀^1 Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) (-t²/16)^n dt. Then, using generating function Σ_{n=0}^∞ C(2n, n) x^n =1/sqrt(1 -4x). So substituting x = -t²/16, we get 1/sqrt(1 -4*(-t²/16)) =1/sqrt(1 + t²/4) =2/sqrt(4 +t²). Therefore, S= ∫₀^1 2/sqrt(4 +t²) dt. This seems correct. Then, integrating 2/sqrt(4 +t²) dt from 0 to1 is 2 sinh^{-1}(t/2) from 0 to1, which is 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). So that's correct. Then, I = π²/4 * S = π²/4 * 2 sinh^{-1}(1/2) = π²/2 sinh^{-1}(1/2). But sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). So I = π²/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). But according to the numerical check, this is approximately 2.374, but the numerical approximation of the integral is about 1.2449. So there's a factor of 2 discrepancy. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the series approach. Let me check the step where I expressed the original integral as the series. The original integral is I = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. Then, expanding arctan(x/(x² +1)) as Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n [x/(x² +1)]^{2n+1}/(2n+1). Then, the integrand becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2}. Then, integrating term-wise. But is this interchange of summation and integration valid? Since the convergence of the series is uniform on [0, ∞)? Maybe not. Perhaps the interchange is not justified, leading to an incorrect result. Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the evaluation of the Beta function. Let me recheck the Beta function calculation.

The integral ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx. Let me compute this integral using substitution. Let me set y =x², dy=2x dx. Then x= sqrt(y), dx= dy/(2 sqrt(y)). The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ y^n/(y +1)^{2n+2} * dy/(2 sqrt(y)) ) = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ y^{n -1/2}/(y +1)^{2n+2} dy. This is (1/2) B(n +1/2, 2n +2 - (n -1/2) -1 +1 ). Wait, the Beta function B(a,b) = ∫₀^∞ y^{a-1}/(1 + y)^{a +b} dy. So here, a =n +1/2, and b= (2n +2) - (n +1/2) =n +3/2. Therefore, B(n +1/2, n +3/2). So the integral is (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2). Which is correct. Then, using Gamma functions:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2)/Γ(2n +2). Then, using Γ(n +1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! )/(4^n n! )) and Γ(n +3/2) = sqrt(π) (2n +2)! )/(4^{n +1} (n +1)! )). Therefore, Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2) = π (2n)! (2n +2)! )/(4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! )). Then, Γ(2n +2) = (2n +1)! ). Therefore, B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = π (2n)! (2n +2)! )/(4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! )). Simplify (2n +2)! = (2n +2)(2n +1)(2n)! ). So:

B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = π (2n)! * (2n +2)(2n +1)(2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ].

Cancel one (2n)!:

= π (2n +2)(2n +1) (2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ].

Cancel (2n +1) in numerator and denominator:

= π (2n +2) (2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n)! ) ].

Cancel (2n)!:

= π (2n +2) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! ) ].

But (2n +2) =2(n +1), so:

= π * 2(n +1) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! ) ].

= π * 2(n +1) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! ) ].

But (n +1)! = (n +1) n! ), so:

= π * 2 / [4^{2n +1} n! n! ) ].

= π * 2 / [4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 ) ].

Therefore, B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = 2 π / (4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 ) ).

Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. So there must be a mistake in the previous steps. Let me re-express:

Γ(n +1/2) = sqrt(π) (2n)! )/(4^n n! )

Γ(n +3/2) = sqrt(π) (2n +2)! )/(4^{n +1} (n +1)! )).

Therefore, Γ(n +1/2)Γ(n +3/2) = π (2n)! (2n +2)! )/(4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! )).

Γ(2n +2) = (2n +1)! ).

Therefore, B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = [ π (2n)! (2n +2)! )/(4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! )) ] / (2n +1)! )

= π (2n)! (2n +2)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ]

= π (2n)! (2n +2)(2n +1)(2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ]

= π (2n +2)(2n)!^2 ) / [4^{2n +1} n! (n +1)! (2n +1)! ) ]

But (2n +2) =2(n +1), and (n +1)! = (n +1) n! ), so:

= π * 2(n +1) (2n)!^2 ) / [4^{2n +1} n! * (n +1) n! ) (2n +1)! ) ]

Cancel (n +1):

= π * 2 (2n)!^2 ) / [4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 (2n +1)! ) ]

But (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)! ), so:

= π * 2 (2n)!^2 ) / [4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 (2n +1)(2n)! ) ]

Cancel one (2n)!:

= π * 2 (2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ]

= 2 π (2n)! ) / [4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ]

= 2 π / (4^{2n +1} (n! )^2 (2n +1) ) ) * (2n)! )

But (2n)! ) / (n! )^2 ) = C(2n, n). So:

= 2 π C(2n, n) / (4^{2n +1} (2n +1) )

Therefore, B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = 2 π C(2n, n) / (4^{2n +1} (2n +1) )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀^∞ x^{2n}/(x² +1)^{2n+2} dx = (1/2) B(n +1/2, n +3/2) = (1/2) * 2 π C(2n, n) / (4^{2n +1} (2n +1) ) ) = π C(2n, n) / (4^{2n +1} (2n +1) )

Therefore, the original series for I is:

I = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(2n+1) * π C(2n, n) / (4^{2n +1} (2n +1) )

= π/4^{2n +1} Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n C(2n, n)/( (2n +1)^2 4^{2n} )

Wait, 4^{2n +1} =4 * 16^n. So:

I = π/4 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n C(2n, n)/( (2n +1)^2 16^n )

This is a different expression than before. So previous step had a mistake in the Beta function evaluation. Therefore, the correct expression for I is π/4 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n C(2n, n)/( (2n +1)^2 16^n ). This series is more complicated and may not have a closed-form expression. Therefore, the previous approach using series expansion might not be the right path.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion in the analytical approach, perhaps I should consider another method. Let me think of substitution or differentiation under the integral sign.

Let me consider the substitution t = x/(x² +1). Let me set t = x/(x² +1). Then, we can express x in terms of t. Let me solve for x. t(x² +1) =x → t x² -x +t =0. Quadratic equation: x = [1 ± sqrt(1 -4t²)]/(2t). But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider substitution u =x² +1. Then du =2x dx. But not sure.

Alternatively, consider integrating with respect to x from 0 to infinity. Let me split the integral into two parts: from 0 to1 and from1 to infinity. For the part from1 to infinity, use substitution x=1/t. Then, as before, the integral becomes ∫₀^1 [t/(t² +1)] arctan(t/(t² +1)) dt. So the original integral I = ∫₀^1 [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx + ∫₀^1 [t/(t² +1)] arctan(t/(t² +1)) dt. Let me denote the first integral as I1 and the second as I2. Then, I = I1 + I2. But from partial fractions earlier, we had I = I1 - I2. Wait, no. Wait, the original integral was split into I1 - I2, but after substitution, we found that I = I2. This seems conflicting. Let me clarify.

Original integral I = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(...) dx. After partial fractions, I = I1 - I2, where I1 = ∫ [1/x] arctan(...) dx and I2 = ∫ [x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx. Then, using substitution x=1/t, we found that I = I2. Therefore, I = I2. But according to partial fractions, I = I1 - I2. Therefore, I2 = I1 - I2 → 2I2 = I1 → I1 = 2I2. Therefore, I = I2 = (I1)/2. But I1 = ∫₀^∞ [1/x] arctan(...) dx. But this seems to diverge, but in reality, due to the behavior of the integrand, it converges. But how to compute I1 or I2?

Alternatively, perhaps consider adding I and J, where J is the integral of [x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx from0 to infinity. But we know that I = J. So I + J = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1)) + x/(x² +1)] arctan(...) dx = ∫₀^∞ [ (1 +x²)/(x(x² +1)) ] arctan(...) dx = ∫₀^∞ [1/x] arctan(...) dx = I1. But since I = J, then I + I = I1 → 2I = I1. But I1 = 2I. But how does this help?

Alternatively, perhaps consider differentiating I with respect to a parameter. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(a x/(x² +1)) dx. Then, compute I(1). Let me compute I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [ x/(x² +1) / (1 + (a x/(x² +1))^2 ) ] dx. Simplify the derivative:

I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [ x/(x² +1) / (1 + a² x²/(x² +1)^2 ) ] dx

= ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [ x/(x² +1) ] / [ (x² +1)^2 + a² x² ) / (x² +1)^2 ) ] dx

= ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [ x/(x² +1) ] * (x² +1)^2 / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx

Simplify:

= ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * x/(x² +1) * (x² +1)^2 / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx

= ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * x (x² +1) / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx

= ∫₀^∞ [1/(x² +1)] * (x² +1) / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx

= ∫₀^∞ 1 / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx

This is a quartic integral. Let me compute this integral. Let me factor the denominator. Let me set x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 = x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1. Let me factor this as (x² + p x +1)(x² - p x +1) = x^4 + (2 - p²) x² +1. Comparing coefficients, 2 - p² =2 +a² → p² = -a². Which is not possible for real p. Therefore, the denominator doesn't factor into real quadratics. Therefore, we can use substitution. Let me use substitution y =x -1/x. Let me try to compute the integral ∫₀^∞ 1/(x^4 + b x² +1) dx, where b=2 +a². The standard integral ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +b x² +1) = π/(2 sqrt(b +2)) ). Let me check. Let me compute this integral. Let me write x^4 +b x² +1 =x^4 +2 x² +1 + (b -2)x²= (x² +1)^2 + (b -2)x². Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution y =x -1/x. Let me set y =x -1/x. Then dy =1 +1/x² dx. Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution x = tanθ. Let me try x = tanθ, dx = sec²θ dθ. Then x^4 +b x² +1 = tan^4θ +b tan²θ +1. Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution x =x. Let me write the denominator as x^4 +b x² +1 =x^4 +2x² +1 + (b -2)x²= (x² +1)^2 + (b -2)x². Not helpful. Alternatively, use partial fractions. Let me recall that ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +c x² +1) = π/(2 sqrt(c +2)) ). Let me check for c=0: ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +1) = π/(2 sqrt(2)) ). Which is correct. For c=2, ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +2x² +1) = ∫₀^∞ dx/(x² +1)^2 = π/4. Which is π/(2 sqrt(2 +2)) = π/(2*2) = π/4. Correct. So the general formula is ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +c x² +1) = π/(2 sqrt(c +2)) ). Therefore, in our case, c=2 +a². Therefore, the integral I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) = π/(2 sqrt( (2 +a²) +2 )) = π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ). Therefore, I’(a) = π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ). Therefore, to find I(a), we integrate I’(a) from a=0 to a=1. Since I(0) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(0) dx =0. Therefore, I(1) = ∫₀^1 I’(a) da = ∫₀^1 π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ) da. Compute this integral:

I = π/2 ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(4 +a²) da. The integral of 1/sqrt(a² +c) da = sinh^{-1}(a/sqrt(c)) + C. So here, c=4. Therefore, ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(a² +4) da = sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(1/2). Therefore, I = π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2). Which is the same as the previous result. But according to the numerical check, this gives approximately 2.374, but the numerical approximation of the integral is about 1.2449. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the numerical approximation. Let me recheck the numerical approximation.

Wait, the numerical approximation I did earlier was for the integral from 0 to1 of [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx, which I approximated as 0.62245 using Simpson's rule with n=4. But according to the analytical result, the total integral I is π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2) ≈ (3.14159265/2) * 0.481211825 ≈1.5707963 *0.481211825 ≈0.756. Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no. Wait, sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ≈0.481211825. So π/2 *0.481211825 ≈1.5707963 *0.481211825 ≈0.756. But this contradicts the previous analytical result of 2.374. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the differentiation under the integral sign approach.

Wait, no. Wait, the differentiation under the integral sign approach gave I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(a x/(x² +1)) dx. Then, I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)] / [1 + (a x/(x² +1))^2 ] dx. Which was simplified to ∫₀^∞ 1/(x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx. Then, using the standard integral, this is π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ). Therefore, integrating I’(a) from 0 to1 gives I(1) = π/2 ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(4 +a²) da = π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2). Which is approximately 0.756. But according to the numerical approximation of the integral from 0 to1 being 0.62245, and the total integral being twice that, which is 1.2449, which is different from 0.756. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the differentiation under the integral sign approach.

Wait, this is impossible. There must be a mistake in the differentiation step. Let me recheck the differentiation step.

Given I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(a x/(x² +1)) dx.

Then, dI/da = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [ x/(x² +1) / (1 + (a x/(x² +1))^2 ) ] dx.

Simplify the integrand:

[1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)] / [1 + a² x²/(x² +1)^2 ]

= [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)] / [ (x² +1)^2 + a² x² ) / (x² +1)^2 ]

= [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)] * (x² +1)^2 / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 )

= [1/(x(x² +1))] * x (x² +1) / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 )

= [1/(x² +1)] * (x² +1) / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 )

= 1 / (x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 )

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ 1/(x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx. Which is a standard integral equal to π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ). Therefore, integrating from a=0 to a=1 gives I(1) = π/2 ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(4 +a²) da = π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2). But sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, I = π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Which is approximately 0.5708 * 0.4812 ≈0.5708*0.4812≈0.275. Wait, no. Wait, π/2 is approximately 1.5708. 1.5708 *0.4812≈0.756. But according to the numerical approximation, the integral from0 to1 is approximately0.62245, and the total integral is twice that, which is1.2449. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the analytical approach. Alternatively, the numerical approximation is incorrect.

Let me compute the integral numerically using a calculator. Let me use numerical integration for the original integral from0 to infinity. Let me use substitution x = tanθ, which transforms the integral to ∫₀^{π/2} cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Let me compute this integral numerically. Let's use θ from0 to π/2. The integrand is cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ). Let me approximate this using Simpson's rule with n=4 intervals. Let θ=0 to π/2, h=(π/2)/4= π/8≈0.3927.

Compute the integrand at θ=0: cotθ approaches infinity, but arctan(0)=0. So the limit is 0. At θ=π/8: cot(π/8)=1/tan(π/8)=sqrt(2)+1≈2.4142. sin2θ=sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2≈0.7071. (1/2) sin2θ≈0.35355. arctan(0.35355)≈0.3398. So integrand≈2.4142*0.3398≈0.820.

At θ=π/4: cot(π/4)=1. sin2θ=sin(π/2)=1. (1/2) sin2θ=0.5. arctan(0.5)≈0.4636. integrand=1*0.4636≈0.4636.

At θ=3π/8: cot(3π/8)=1/tan(3π/8)=sqrt(2)-1≈0.4142. sin2θ=sin(3π/4)=sqrt(2)/2≈0.7071. (1/2) sin2θ≈0.35355. arctan(0.35355)≈0.3398. integrand≈0.4142*0.3398≈0.1407.

At θ=π/2: cot(π/2)=0. So integrand=0.

Using Simpson's rule:

Integral≈ (h/3)[f(0) +4(f(π/8)+f(3π/8)) +2(f(π/4)) +f(π/2)]

= (π/8 /3)[0 +4*(0.820 +0.1407) +2*0.4636 +0]

= (π/24)[4*(0.9607) +0.9272]

= (π/24)[3.8428 +0.9272]

= (π/24)*4.77 ≈ (3.1416/24)*4.77 ≈0.1309*4.77≈0.624. Which is close to the previous numerical approximation of the integral from0 to1. But according to the analytical result, the integral should be approximately0.756. But this is for the transformed integral. Wait, the transformed integral is ∫₀^{π/2} cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Which is equal to the original integral I. But according to the numerical approximation, it's approximately0.624, but according to the analytical result, it's0.756. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the analytical derivation.

Wait, but according to the differentiation under the integral sign approach, the integral I is π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2) ≈0.756. But the numerical approximation gives around0.624. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the analytical steps. Let me check the differentiation under the integral sign approach again.

Given I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(a x/(x² +1)) dx.

Then, I’(a) = ∫₀^∞ [1/(x(x² +1))] * [x/(x² +1)] / [1 + (a x/(x² +1))^2 ] dx.

But this simplifies to ∫₀^∞ 1/(x^4 + (2 +a²) x² +1 ) dx. Which is correct. Then, using the standard integral ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +c x² +1) = π/(2 sqrt(c +2) ). Therefore, c=2 +a². Therefore, I’(a) = π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ). Therefore, integrating from a=0 to a=1:

I(1) = ∫₀^1 π/(2 sqrt(4 +a²) ) da = π/2 ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(4 +a²) da.

The integral ∫₀^1 1/sqrt(4 +a²) da = sinh^{-1}(a/2) evaluated from0 to1 = sinh^{-1}(1/2) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(1/2) = ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, I(1) = π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ≈1.5708 *0.4812≈0.756. But according to the numerical approximation, the integral is approximately0.624. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the analytical approach. Alternatively, the standard integral formula is incorrect.

Wait, let me verify the standard integral ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +c x² +1). Let me check for c=2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +2x² +1) = ∫₀^∞ dx/(x² +1)^2 = π/4. According to the formula, it should be π/(2 sqrt(2 +2)) = π/(2*2) = π/4. Correct. For c=0, ∫₀^∞ dx/(x^4 +1) = π/(2 sqrt(2)) ). Which is correct. Therefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, the analytical result must be correct. Therefore, the numerical approximation must be wrong. Let me check the numerical approximation again.

Let me compute the original integral numerically using a more accurate method. Let me use substitution x = tanθ, leading to ∫₀^{π/2} cotθ arctan( (1/2) sin2θ ) dθ. Let me use numerical integration with higher precision. Let me use the midpoint rule with a large number of intervals. Let me use n=1000 intervals. Let me compute the integral in Python code:

import numpy as np

n = 1000000
a = 0
b = np.pi/2
h = (b - a)/n

integral = 0
for i in range(n):
    theta = a + (i + 0.5)*h
    cot_theta = 1/np.tan(theta)
    sin2theta = np.sin(2*theta)
    arg = 0.5 * sin2theta
    arctan_arg = np.arctan(arg)
    integrand = cot_theta * arctan_arg
    integral += integrand * h

print(integral)

But since I can't run code here, let me estimate. For large n, the integral should approach the analytical result of approximately0.756. However, previous Simpson's rule with n=4 gave0.624, which is lower. Let me try with n=8.

θ=0 to π/2, h=8 intervals. h=π/16≈0.19635.

Compute midpoints at θ= h/2, 3/2h, ..., 15/2h.

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, trust the analytical result. Given that the differentiation under the integral sign approach is rigorous and the standard integral formula is correct, the analytical result must be correct. Therefore, the integral I is π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, the exact answer is (π²/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Wait, no. Wait, the result from differentiation under the integral sign is I = π/2 * sinh^{-1}(1/2) = π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, the exact answer is (π/2) * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Let me compute this:

ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ≈0.4812118255.

π/2 ≈1.57079632679.

Multiply:1.57079632679 *0.4812118255≈0.756. So the exact answer is π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ), and the numerical approximation is approximately0.756. Therefore, the numerical approximation I did earlier must have been incorrect due to using too few intervals. Therefore, the correct analytical result is π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ), which is approximately0.756. Therefore, the final answer is this.

But wait, the original integral is from0 to infinity of [1/(x(x² +1))] arctan(x/(x² +1)) dx. According to the differentiation under the integral sign approach, the answer is π/2 * ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, the exact answer is (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Let me write this in LaTeX:

\frac{\pi}{2} \ln\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)

Numerical approximation: approximately0.756. Let me compute it more precisely. Let me compute ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ):

sqrt(5)≈2.2360679775

1 + sqrt(5)≈3.2360679775

Divide by2:≈1.61803398875

ln(1.61803398875)≈0.481211825359

Multiply by π/2≈1.57079632679:

0.481211825359 *1.57079632679≈0.756. So numerical approximation is approximately0.756.

But let me check with higher precision:

0.481211825359 *1.5707963267948966 = 0.481211825359 *1.5707963267948966 ≈

0.481211825359 *1.5707963267948966 ≈

0.481211825359 *1.5 =0.721817738

0.481211825359 *0.0707963267948966≈0.481211825359 *0.07≈0.033684.827775

Total≈0.721817738 +0.033684.827775≈0.755502565. So approximately0.755502565. Rounded to10 decimal places:0.7555025652.

Therefore, the final answer is exact: (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ), numerical approximation≈0.7555025652.
