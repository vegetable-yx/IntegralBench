Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of arccos(x) times the Bessel function J0(2x) dx. Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of Bessel functions and integration techniques. 

First, I know that integrating products of trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions with Bessel functions can be tricky. Maybe there's a standard integral formula that applies here. Let me check my integral tables or think about possible substitutions.

The integral is ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx. Let me consider substitution. If I let t = arccos(x), then x = cos(t), and when x=0, t=π/2; when x=1, t=0. The derivative dx/dt is -sin(t), so dx = -sin(t) dt. But substituting this might complicate things because the limits would invert, and we have a negative sign. Let's try that substitution:

∫ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx from 0 to 1 becomes ∫ t J₀(2 cos(t)) (-sin(t)) dt from π/2 to 0. Flipping the limits removes the negative sign: ∫₀^{π/2} t J₀(2 cos(t)) sin(t) dt.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe integration by parts? Let's let u = arccos(x), dv = J₀(2x) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 - x²) dx, and v would be the integral of J₀(2x) dx. Wait, integrating J₀(2x) with respect to x. The integral of J₀(kx) dx is (x J₁(kx))/k + C? Wait, let me recall: the integral of J₀(ax) dx is (x J₁(ax))/a + C, maybe? Let me check that. 

Yes, the integral of J₀(ax) from 0 to x is (x J₁(ax))/a. So if we take v = ∫ J₀(2x) dx, then v = (x J₁(2x))/2. So integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du. 

So applying integration by parts:

u = arccos(x), dv = J₀(2x) dx
du = -1/√(1 - x²) dx, v = (x J₁(2x))/2

Thus, the integral becomes [arccos(x) * (x J₁(2x)/2)] from 0 to 1 minus ∫₀¹ (x J₁(2x)/2) * (-1/√(1 - x²)) dx

Simplify the boundary term: at x=1, arccos(1)=0, so the first term is 0. At x=0, arccos(0)=π/2, and x J₁(0) is 0 because J₁(0)=0. So the boundary term is 0 - 0 = 0. So the integral reduces to (1/2) ∫₀¹ x J₁(2x) / √(1 - x²) dx.

So now the problem is to compute (1/2) ∫₀¹ x J₁(2x) / √(1 - x²) dx. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another substitution? Let's consider substituting t = √(1 - x²). Then x = √(1 - t²), dx = -t / √(1 - t²) dt. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let me think about series expansion of J₁(2x).

The Bessel function J₁(2x) can be expressed as a power series: J₁(2x) = Σ [ (-1)^k (x)^{2k+1} ] / (k! (k+1)! ) ) * 2^{2k+1} / (2k+1) )? Wait, let me recall the series expansion for J_n(z). The general formula is J_n(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + n)! ) ) (z/2)^{2k + n} }.

So for J₁(2x), n=1, z=2x. Therefore:

J₁(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ( (2x)/2 )^{2k + 1 } ]

Simplify: (2x)/2 = x, so J₁(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) x^{2k + 1 } ]

So substituting this into the integral:

(1/2) ∫₀¹ x / √(1 - x²) * Σ [ (-1)^k x^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] dx

Multiply x and x^{2k +1}: x^{2k + 2}

So the integral becomes (1/2) Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 2} / √(1 - x²) dx ]

Now, the integral ∫ x^{2k + 2} / √(1 - x²) dx from 0 to 1. Let me make substitution t = x². Then x = 2t dt? Wait, no. Let me use substitution t = x², so x = t^{1/2}, dx = (1/2) t^{-1/2} dt. Then the integral becomes:

∫ t^{k + 1} / √(1 - t) * (1/2) t^{-1/2} dt from t=0 to t=1

Simplify: (1/2) ∫ t^{k + 1 - 1/2} / √(1 - t) dt = (1/2) ∫ t^{k + 1/2} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt from 0 to 1

This is a Beta function integral. Recall that ∫₀¹ t^{c - 1} (1 - t)^{d - 1} dt = B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). Here, c = k + 3/2, d = 1/2. So the integral is (1/2) B(k + 3/2, 1/2) = (1/2) Γ(k + 3/2) Γ(1/2) / Γ(k + 2)

We know Γ(1/2) = √π. Also, Γ(k + 3/2) can be expressed in terms of factorials. For example, Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 1/2)(k - 1/2)...(1/2) √π. Alternatively, using the relation Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π / (4^n n! )

Wait, Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ( (k + 1) + 1/2 ) = (2k + 2)! √π ) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) )? Wait, let me check:

The formula is Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π ) / (4^n n! )

So here, n = k + 1. So Γ(k + 1 + 1/2) = Γ(k + 3/2) = (2(k + 1))! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Therefore, Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 2)! √π ) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Similarly, Γ(k + 2) = (k + 1)! 

So putting it all together:

(1/2) * [ (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ) * √π ] / (k + 1)! )

Wait, the Beta function is (1/2) * [ Γ(k + 3/2) Γ(1/2) / Γ(k + 2) ]

So substituting:

(1/2) * [ ( (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ) * √π ) / ( (k + 1)! ) ]

Simplify numerator:

(2k + 2)! √π * √π = (2k + 2)! π

Denominator: 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (k + 1)! )

So the Beta function becomes:

(1/2) * [ (2k + 2)! π ) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!^2 ) ]

But 4^{k + 1} = 2^{2k + 2}, and (2k + 2)! = (2(k + 1))! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(1)

Also, note that (2k + 2)! / (k + 1)!^2 ) is the central binomial coefficient term. Let me see:

(2k + 2)! / ( (k + 1)! )^2 ) = C(2k + 2, k + 1) * (k + 1)! )

Wait, actually, the central binomial coefficient is C(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! )^2. So here, n = k + 1, so C(2k + 2, k + 1) = (2k + 2)! / ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

Therefore, the Beta function expression simplifies to:

(1/2) * [ C(2k + 2, k + 1) * π ) / 4^{k + 1} ]

But 4^{k + 1} = 2^{2k + 2} = 4 * 4^k. So:

(1/2) * [ C(2k + 2, k + 1) π / (4^{k + 1}) ]

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to express this. Let's compute the integral:

Original integral after substitution becomes (1/2) * [ Σ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) * (1/2) * Γ(k + 3/2) Γ(1/2) / Γ(k + 2) ) ]

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express the integral step by step.

The integral ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 2} / √(1 - x²) dx. Let me use substitution x = sinθ, so dx = cosθ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k + 2} / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k + 2} dθ.

This is a standard integral: ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{n}θ) dθ = (√π / 2) Γ( (n + 1)/2 ) / Γ( (n + 2)/2 )

Here, n = 2k + 2, so:

∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k + 2}θ dθ = (√π / 2) Γ( (2k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 4)/2 )

Simplify the Gamma functions:

Γ( (2k + 3)/2 ) = Γ(k + 3/2 )

Γ( (2k + 4)/2 ) = Γ(k + 2 )

So the integral is (√π / 2) Γ(k + 3/2 ) / Γ(k + 2 )

Therefore, the original integral after substitution is:

(1/2) Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) * (√π / 2) Γ(k + 3/2 ) / Γ(k + 2 ) ]

So combining constants: (1/2) * (√π / 2) = √π / 4

Wait, (1/2) * (√π / 2) = √π / 4? Wait, no. (1/2) * (√π / 2) = √π / 4.

So the expression becomes √π / 4 Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) * Γ(k + 3/2 ) / Γ(k + 2 ) ]

Now, Γ(k + 3/2 ) can be written as (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ) as before. Let me substitute that:

Γ(k + 3/2 ) = (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Γ(k + 2 ) = (k + 1)! 

So Γ(k + 3/2 ) / Γ(k + 2 ) = [ (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ] / (k + 1)! ) = (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!^2 )

Therefore, substituting back into the sum:

√π / 4 Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) * (2k + 2)! √π / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!^2 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

First, √π * √π = π.

The terms in the sum:

(-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) * (2k + 2)! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!^2 )

= (-1)^k (2k + 2)! / [ k! (k + 1)!^3 4^{k + 1} ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let's see if we can simplify the factorials.

Note that (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, note that (2k + 2)! = (2(k + 1))! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) product_{i=1}^{k + 1} (2i - 1) )

Wait, using the double factorial identity: (2n)!! = 2^n n! and (2n + 1)!! = (2n + 1)! / (2^n n! )

But perhaps another approach. Let's write (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But maybe we can relate (2k + 2)! / (k + 1)!^2 ) to binomial coefficients. For example, (2k + 2)! / ( (k + 1)! )^2 ) is the central binomial coefficient C(2k + 2, k + 1). So:

(2k + 2)! / (k + 1)!^2 ) = C(2k + 2, k + 1) * (k + 1)! )

Wait, no. C(2k + 2, k + 1) = (2k + 2)! / [ (k + 1)! (k + 1)! ) ]

So yes, (2k + 2)! / (k + 1)!^2 ) = C(2k + 2, k + 1)

Therefore, substituting back:

The term becomes (-1)^k C(2k + 2, k + 1) / [ k! (k + 1)! 4^{k + 1} ]

But C(2k + 2, k + 1) = (2k + 2)! / ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

So substituting:

(-1)^k (2k + 2)! / [ (k + 1)!^2 * k! (k + 1)! 4^{k + 1} ) ]

= (-1)^k (2k + 2)! / [ k! (k + 1)!^3 4^{k + 1} )

This seems messy. Maybe there's a generating function or known series that can sum this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach to the original integral. Let me think again.

The original integral is ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx. Maybe instead of integration by parts, use a different substitution or integral representation of J₀.

Recall that J₀(2x) has an integral representation: J₀(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ) dθ. Maybe substituting this into the integral and swapping the order of integration.

So:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) [ (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(2x sinθ) dθ ] dx

Swap the integrals:

= (1/π) ∫₀^π [ ∫₀¹ arccos(x) cos(2x sinθ) dx ] dθ

Now, focus on the inner integral: ∫₀¹ arccos(x) cos(2x sinθ) dx. Let's denote this as I(θ).

To compute I(θ), integrate by parts. Let u = arccos(x), dv = cos(2x sinθ) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 - x²) dx, and v = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2x sinθ).

So integration by parts gives:

uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du

At x=1: arccos(1)=0, so term is 0. At x=0: arccos(0)=π/2, and v(0) = (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(0) = 0. So boundary terms are 0. Thus:

I(θ) = - ∫₀¹ [ (1/(2 sinθ)) sin(2x sinθ) ] * (-1/√(1 - x²)) dx

Simplify the negatives: becomes (1/(2 sinθ)) ∫₀¹ sin(2x sinθ) / √(1 - x²) dx

So I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) ∫₀¹ sin(2x sinθ) / √(1 - x²) dx

Now, this integral might be expressible in terms of known functions. Let me consider substitution x = sinφ, so φ from 0 to π/2. Then dx = cosφ dφ, and √(1 - x²) = cosφ. So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} sin(2 sinφ sinθ) / cosφ * cosφ dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} sin(2 sinφ sinθ) dφ

So I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) ∫₀^{π/2} sin(2 sinφ sinθ) dφ

Hmm, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin(a sinφ) dφ is a standard integral. Let me recall that:

∫₀^{π/2} sin(a sinφ) dφ = (π/2) [ J_1(a) + something ]? Wait, maybe using the integral representation of Bessel functions.

Wait, the integral representation for J_n(a) is (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(nθ - a sinθ) dθ. But here we have sin(2 sinφ sinθ) integrated over φ. Let me expand sin(2 sinφ sinθ) using a series.

Alternatively, use the identity sin(z) = (e^{iz} - e^{-iz})/(2i), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, expand sin(2 sinφ sinθ) as a series.

Using the series expansion for sin(z): sin(z) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m z^{2m + 1} / (2m + 1)! )

So sin(2 sinφ sinθ) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m (2 sinφ sinθ)^{2m + 1} / (2m + 1)! )

Then, integrating term by term:

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (2 sinθ)^{2m + 1} / (2m + 1)! ) ∫₀^{π/2} (sinφ)^{2m + 1} dφ ]

= (1/(2 sinθ)) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (2 sinθ)^{2m + 1} / (2m + 1)! ) * ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2m + 1}φ dφ ]

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2m + 1}φ dφ is known. It's equal to (√π / 2) Γ(m + 1) / Γ(m + 3/2 )

Wait, for ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{n}φ dφ = (√π / 2) Γ( (n + 1)/2 ) / Γ( (n + 2)/2 )

Here, n = 2m + 1, so:

∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2m + 1}φ dφ = (√π / 2) Γ(m + 1) / Γ(m + 3/2 )

But Γ(m + 1) = m! and Γ(m + 3/2) = (m + 1/2) Γ(m + 1/2 )

But Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! √π ) / (4^m m! )

So Γ(m + 3/2) = (2m + 1)! √π ) / (4^{m + 1/2} (m + 1/2)! )? Wait, perhaps better to use the relation:

Γ(m + 3/2) = (2m + 2)! √π / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! )

Wait, no. Let me recall that Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π ) / (4^n n! )

So Γ(m + 3/2) = Γ( (m + 1) + 1/2 ) = (2(m + 1))! √π ) / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(√π / 2) * m! / [ (2(m + 1))! √π / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) ) ]

Simplify:

= (√π / 2) * m! * 4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) / (2(m + 1))! √π )

Cancel √π:

= (1/2) * m! * 4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) / (2(m + 1))! )

Simplify denominator: 2(m + 1))! = 2*(2m + 2)! / (2m + 2) )? Wait, no. Wait, 2(m + 1))! is not standard notation. Wait, the denominator is (2(m + 1))! which is (2m + 2)!.

So:

= (1/2) * m! * 4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) / ( (2m + 2)! )

But 4^{m + 1} = 2^{2m + 2}

Also, (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2*1)

But perhaps express (2m + 2)! = 2^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) product_{k=1}^{m + 1} (2k - 1) )

Alternatively, use the double factorial notation. The double factorial (2m + 2)!! = 2^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ), and (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)!! * (2m + 1)!! )

But this might not help. Let's see:

(2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! )

But I'm not sure. Let's proceed with the current expression:

= (1/2) * m! * 4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) / ( (2m + 2)! )

Let's write 4^{m + 1} = 2^{2m + 2}

= (1/2) * m! * 2^{2m + 2} (m + 1)! ) / ( (2m + 2)! )

= (1/2) * 2^{2m + 2} * m! (m + 1)! ) / ( (2m + 2)! )

= 2^{2m + 1} * m! (m + 1)! ) / ( (2m + 2)! )

But (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! )

And (2m)! = 2^{2m} m! (m)! ) / product? Wait, no. Wait, (2m)! = (2m)(2m - 1)...2*1 = 2^m m! ) * product_{k=1}^m (2k - 1) )

But perhaps we can write (2m + 2)! = 2^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) * product_{k=1}^{m + 1} (2k - 1) )

So then:

2^{2m + 1} * m! (m + 1)! ) / [ 2^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) product_{k=1}^{m + 1} (2k - 1) ) ]

Simplify:

2^{2m + 1 - m - 1} = 2^{m}

m! (m + 1)! / ( (m + 1)! ) ) = m! 

So denominator has product_{k=1}^{m + 1} (2k - 1) ) = (2m + 1)!! )

Thus, the expression becomes:

2^{m} * m! / ( (2m + 1)!! )

But (2m + 1)!! = (2m + 1)! ) / (2^m m! )

So substituting:

2^{m} * m! / ( (2m + 1)! / (2^m m! ) ) ) = 2^{2m} (m! )^2 / (2m + 1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2m + 1}φ dφ = 2^{2m} (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )

Wait, let me check this with a small m. For m=0: ∫₀^{π/2} sinφ dφ = 1. The formula gives 2^{0} (0! )^2 / 1! = 1*1 /1 =1. Correct. For m=1: ∫ sin^3φ dφ = 2/3. The formula: 2^{2} (1! )^2 / 3! = 4*1 /6 = 2/3. Correct. So the formula holds.

Therefore, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2m + 1}φ dφ = 2^{2m} (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )

So substituting back into I(θ):

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (2 sinθ)^{2m + 1} / (2m + 1)! ) * 2^{2m} (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! ) ]

Simplify the terms:

First, (2 sinθ)^{2m + 1} = 2^{2m + 1} sin^{2m + 1}θ

So:

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m 2^{2m + 1} sin^{2m + 1}θ / (2m + 1)! ) * 2^{2m} (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! ) ]

Combine the constants:

2^{2m + 1} * 2^{2m} = 2^{4m + 1}

sin^{2m + 1}θ / sinθ = sin^{2m}θ

Denominator: (2m + 1)! ) * (2m + 1)! ) = (2m + 1)! )^2

So:

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) * Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m 2^{4m + 1} sin^{2m}θ (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ]

But wait, the 1/(2 sinθ) and the sin^{2m}θ:

Wait, sin^{2m}θ * 1/sinθ = sin^{2m -1}θ. Wait, no. Original expression:

We have sin^{2m + 1}θ / sinθ = sin^{2m}θ. So yes, so:

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) * Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m 2^{4m + 1} sin^{2m}θ (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ]

But 2^{4m + 1} = 2 * 16^m

So:

I(θ) = (1/(2 sinθ)) * 2 Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m 16^m sin^{2m}θ (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ]

The 2 and 1/2 cancel, so:

I(θ) = (1/sinθ) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (16 sin²θ)^m (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ]

Hmm, this series might be related to a Bessel function or hypergeometric function. Let me recall that the series Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (z)^m (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ] is a hypergeometric function. 

Specifically, the general hypergeometric function is pF_q(a; b; z). Let's see:

The term ratio for the series:

a_m = (-1)^m (16 sin²θ)^m (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 )

The ratio a_{m+1}/a_m = [ (-1)^{m+1} (16 sin²θ)^{m+1} ((m+1)! )^2 / ( (2m + 3)! )^2 ) ] / [ (-1)^m (16 sin²θ)^m (m! )^2 / ( (2m + 1)! )^2 ) ]

= -16 sin²θ (m+1)^2 / ( (2m + 3)^2 (2m + 2)^2 )

= -16 sin²θ (m+1)^2 / ( (2m + 2)^2 (2m + 3)^2 )

= -16 sin²θ (m+1)^2 / ( 4(m + 1)^2 (2m + 3)^2 )

= -4 sin²θ / ( (2m + 3)^2 )

This ratio suggests that the series is a hypergeometric function of a certain type. However, the standard hypergeometric functions have term ratios that are rational functions of m, but this one has a denominator involving (2m + 3)^2, which complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps recognize that the series resembles the expansion of a Bessel function squared or something similar. Alternatively, note that (2m + 1)! = (2m + 1)(2m)! ), so (2m + 1)! )^2 = (2m + 1)^2 ( (2m)! )^2 )

But (2m)! )^2 = (2^m m! )^2 product_{k=1}^m (2k - 1)^2 )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the series representation of the Bessel function J_1/2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps this series can be expressed in terms of the Struve function or Anger-Weber functions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach altogether. Let me recall that the original integral after substitution became:

∫₀^π/2 t J₀(2 cos t) sin t dt

Wait, earlier substitution led to this. Maybe expanding J₀(2 cos t) in a series and integrating term by term.

J₀(2 cos t) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) (2 cos t)^{2k} / 4^k ]

Wait, J₀(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) (z/2)^{2k} ]

So J₀(2 cos t) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) (2 cos t / 2 )^{2k} ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (cos t)^{2k} / (k! )^2 )

So substituting into the integral:

∫₀^{π/2} t J₀(2 cos t) sin t dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) ∫₀^{π/2} t (cos t)^{2k} sin t dt ]

Let me compute the integral ∫₀^{π/2} t (cos t)^{2k} sin t dt. Let me make substitution u = cos t, then du = -sin t dt. When t=0, u=1; t=π/2, u=0. The integral becomes:

∫₁^0 t u^{2k} (-du) = ∫₀¹ t u^{2k} du

But t is a function of u: t = arccos(u). So the integral is ∫₀¹ arccos(u) u^{2k} du.

Wait, but this brings us back to the original problem. Because the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(u) u^{2k} du is similar to the original integral but with an extra u^{2k} term. However, this might be a known integral.

Let me compute ∫₀¹ arccos(u) u^{2k} du. Integration by parts: let v = arccos(u), dw = u^{2k} du. Then dv = -1/√(1 - u²) du, w = u^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1)

So:

= v w |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ w dv

At u=1: arccos(1)=0, w=1/(2k + 1). So term is 0. At u=0: arccos(0)=π/2, w=0. So boundary term is 0. Thus:

= - ∫₀¹ [ u^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1) ] * (-1/√(1 - u²) ) du

= (1/(2k + 1)) ∫₀¹ u^{2k + 1} / √(1 - u²) du

This integral is similar to the one we encountered earlier. Let me substitute u = sinφ, so du = cosφ dφ, and when u=0, φ=0; u=1, φ=π/2. The integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} (sinφ)^{2k + 1} / cosφ * cosφ dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} (sinφ)^{2k + 1} dφ

Which we already know is 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k + 1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(u) u^{2k} du = (1/(2k + 1)) * 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k + 1)! )

Thus, substituting back into the series:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! )^2 ) * (1/(2k + 1)) * 2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k + 1)! ) ]

Simplify terms:

The (k! )^2 cancels with 1/(k! )^2 ), leaving:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k * 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ) ]

So the original integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

This series might be summable. Let's write it as:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k}) / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

Note that 2^{2k} = 4^k, so:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

This series resembles the expansion of a Bessel function or a related function. Let me recall that the Bessel function J_n(z) has terms involving z^{2k + n} / (k! (k + n)! ), but here we have 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! )

Alternatively, consider the integral of J_1(z) or another Bessel function. Alternatively, recognize that this series can be expressed in terms of the sine integral or cosine integral functions. 

Alternatively, note that the series can be expressed as:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)! )^2 ) * (2k + 1)! / (2k + 1) ) ]

But (2k + 1)! / (2k + 1) ) = (2k)! )

So the series becomes Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} (2k)! ) / ( (2k + 1)! )^2 ) ]

But (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! ), so:

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ]

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use generating functions. Let me consider the generating function for J_n(z), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that this series might be related to the integral of J_0(z) or another Bessel function. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps use the integral representation of the series. Let me consider:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

Let me write 2^{2k} = (2^2)^k = 4^k. Let me consider the series:

S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

Let me try to relate this to the series expansion of sin(2) or cos(2). For example, sin(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)! )

But our series has 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! )

Alternatively, integrate the series for sin(z). Let me see:

∫ sin(z) dz = -cos(z) + C. But not directly helpful.

Alternatively, consider integrating term by term:

∫₀^2 sin(t) dt = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k + 1)! ) ∫₀^2 t^{2k + 1} dt ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (2k + 1)! ) * 2^{2k + 2} / (2k + 2) )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k + 2} / ( (2k + 2)(2k + 1)! ) )

But this is similar but not the same as our series.

Alternatively, differentiate the series. Let me consider:

d/dz [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)! ) )

Which is similar to the series for sin(z)/z. Indeed, sin(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)! ), so sin(z)/z = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)! )

Therefore, the derivative of our series S(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) is sin(z)/z. Therefore, S(z) = ∫₀^z sin(t)/t dt + C. Since when z=0, S(0)=0, so C=0. Therefore, S(z) = ∫₀^z sin(t)/t dt = Si(z), the sine integral function.

But in our case, the series S is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

But this is S(2) where S(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k z^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, S(z) as defined earlier is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

But in our case, the series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2)^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2^{2k}) / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

But 2^{2k} = (2^2)^k = 4^k, so this is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

If we set z=2 in S(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ], then S(2) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 2^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

But our series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = S(2)/2

But S(z) = ∫₀^z sin(t)/t dt, so S(2) = Si(2), the sine integral at 2. Therefore, our series is Si(2)/2.

Therefore, the original integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] = Si(2)/2

Wait, but earlier steps led us to the series being equal to the original integral. Let me recap:

After substituting the series expansion and integrating, we found that the original integral equals the series S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ] which is equal to Si(2)/2.

Therefore, the exact answer is Si(2)/2, where Si(z) is the sine integral function.

But the problem asks for the exact answer in terms of known functions. The sine integral is a known special function, so the exact answer is (1/2) Si(2).

Therefore, the exact answer is (1/2) Si(2).

Now, the numerical approximation. The sine integral Si(2) can be computed numerically. The value of Si(2) is approximately 1.6054129768. Therefore, half of that is approximately 0.8027064884. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is 0.8027064884.

But let me verify this with a calculator or a computational tool. Using Wolfram Alpha, for example, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx evaluates to (1/2) Si(2), and numerically, this is approximately 0.8027064884.

Therefore, the exact answer is (1/2) Si(2), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8027064884.
