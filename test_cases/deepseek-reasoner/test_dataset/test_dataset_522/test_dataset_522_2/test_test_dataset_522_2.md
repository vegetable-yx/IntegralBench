Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-2019/(4t²)) divided by t² dt. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that integrals involving exponentials and powers of t can sometimes be tackled with substitution. Let me think about a substitution that would simplify the exponent here.

The exponent is -2019/(4t²). Maybe if I let u be something related to 1/t, because the exponent has 1/t². Let's try substituting u = 1/t. Then, du/dt would be -1/t², which is convenient because the integrand has 1/t² dt. So, when t approaches 0, u approaches infinity, and when t approaches infinity, u approaches 0. That means the limits of integration will switch, right? So the integral becomes the integral from u = ∞ to u = 0 of e^(-2019 u²/4) * (-du). The negative sign flips the limits back to 0 to ∞, so we have ∫₀^∞ e^(-2019 u²/4) du.

Wait, that's a standard Gaussian integral! The integral of e^{-a u²} du from 0 to ∞ is (1/2)√(π/a). Let me confirm that. Yes, the Gaussian integral formula is ∫₀^∞ e^{-k x²} dx = (1/2)√(π/k). So in this case, a is 2019/4. Therefore, substituting a = 2019/4, the integral becomes (1/2) * sqrt(π / (2019/4)) = (1/2) * sqrt(4π/2019) = (1/2)*(2/√2019)*√π = √(π)/√2019.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. Original substitution: u = 1/t, so du = -1/t² dt, which means dt = -t² du. But since t = 1/u, dt = - (1/u²) du. Wait, but the original integral is ∫ (e^{-2019/(4t²)} ) / t² dt. Substituting t = 1/u, dt = -1/u² du. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ (e^{-2019 u² /4}) / (1/u²) * (-1/u²) du. Let me compute that step by step.

Original integral: ∫₀^∞ [e^{-2019/(4t²)}] / t² dt.

Let u = 1/t, so t = 1/u, dt = -1/u² du. When t approaches 0, u approaches infinity; when t approaches infinity, u approaches 0. So changing variables:

Integral becomes ∫_{u=∞}^{u=0} e^{-2019 u² /4} / (1/u²) * (-1/u²) du.

Simplify the terms:

First, 1/t² is (1/(1/u²)) = u². Then, the integrand is e^{-2019 u² /4} * u² * (-1/u²) du. The u² and 1/u² cancel out, leaving -e^{-2019 u² /4} du. The limits are from ∞ to 0, so flipping them and removing the negative sign gives ∫₀^∞ e^{-2019 u² /4} du. That's correct. So the integral is the same as the standard integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-a u²} du, where a = 2019/4.

The standard result is (1/2)√(π/a). So substituting a = 2019/4:

(1/2) * sqrt(π / (2019/4)) = (1/2) * sqrt(4π/2019) = (1/2)*(2/sqrt(2019)) * sqrt(π) = sqrt(π)/sqrt(2019).

Simplify sqrt(π)/sqrt(2019) as sqrt(π/2019). So the exact answer is sqrt(π/2019). Let me check that again. Yes, because sqrt(4π/2019) divided by 2 is sqrt(π/2019). So that's the analytical result.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute sqrt(π/2019). First, compute π ≈ 3.1415926536. Then, 2019 is 2019. So π divided by 2019 is approximately 3.1415926536 / 2019 ≈ 0.00155595. Then take the square root of that. sqrt(0.00155595) ≈ 0.03944345. Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute π ≈ 3.141592653589793. Then π/2019 ≈ 3.141592653589793 / 2019 ≈ 0.0015559543. Then sqrt(0.0015559543) ≈ 0.0394434543. Let me check with a calculator. 0.0394434543 squared is approximately 0.00155595, which matches. So rounding to 10 decimal places, that would be approximately 0.0394434543. Let me check the exact decimal expansion.

Alternatively, use a calculator for sqrt(pi/2019). Let me compute it more precisely. Let's compute pi to more decimals: 3.1415926535897932384626433. Divide by 2019: 3.1415926535897932384626433 / 2019 ≈ 0.0015559543112. Then sqrt(0.0015559543112) ≈ 0.039443454335. So rounding to 10 decimal places: 0.0394434543. Wait, but let me check with a calculator. Let me compute sqrt(pi)/sqrt(2019). Since sqrt(pi) ≈ 1.772453850905516, and sqrt(2019) ≈ 44.94441010848846. Then 1.772453850905516 / 44.94441010848846 ≈ 0.039443454335. So yes, the numerical value is approximately 0.0394434543, which rounds to 10 decimal places as 0.0394434543. Wait, but let's check if the 11th decimal is 5 or more. Let me compute with higher precision.

Alternatively, use a calculator. Let me use Python to compute this. Let's see:

import math
result = math.sqrt(math.pi / 2019)
print("{0:.10f}".format(result))

Calculating this, math.pi is approximately 3.141592653589793. 3.141592653589793 / 2019 = 0.0015559543112422023. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0015559543112422023) ≈ 0.039443454335. So rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 0.0394434543. Wait, but let's check the 11th decimal. The exact value is approximately 0.039443454335... So the 10th decimal is 3, and the 11th is 5, so we round up. Wait, 0.039443454335 would be 0.0394434543 (up to 10 decimals) because the 11th digit is 3, which is less than 5. Wait, no: 0.039443454335 is 0.0394434543 (first 10 decimals) and the 11th is 3, so it stays as 0.0394434543. Wait, but maybe I miscalculated. Let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator. Let me compute sqrt(pi/2019):

pi ≈ 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

pi/2019 ≈ 0.0015559543112422023222512003...

sqrt(0.0015559543112422023222512003) ≈ 0.03944345433500927...

So up to 10 decimal places: 0.0394434543 (since the 11th decimal is 5, which would round the 10th up from 0.0394434543 to 0.0394434544? Wait, wait, let's see:

The number is 0.03944345433500927...

Breaking it down:

0.0394434543 3 5...

The first 10 decimals: 0.0394434543 (positions 1-10). The 11th digit is 3, then 5. Wait, no, after the decimal: positions:

1: 0
2: 3
3: 9
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 5
9: 4
10: 3
11: 5
...

Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's write it out:

0.039443454335...

So after the decimal point:

1: 0
2: 3
3: 9
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 5
9: 4
10: 3
11: 3
12: 5
...

Wait, that can't be. Wait, 0.039443454335 is:

0.0 3 9 4 4 3 4 5 4 3 3 5...

So positions 1 to 10 after the decimal:

1: 0
2: 3
3: 9
4: 4
5: 4
6: 3
7: 4
8: 5
9: 4
10: 3
11: 3
12: 5

So the 10th decimal is 3, the 11th is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't change the 10th. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 0.0394434543 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Wait, but when I compute sqrt(pi/2019) using a calculator, let me check:

pi ≈ 3.141592653589793

2019 is 2019.

pi/2019 ≈ 3.141592653589793 / 2019 ≈ 0.0015559543112422023

sqrt(0.0015559543112422023) ≈ 0.03944345433500927

So 0.03944345433500927. Let's count the decimals:

0.03944345433500927

After the decimal:

0 . 0 3 9 4 4 3 4 5 4 3 3 5 0 0 9 2 7...

So positions:

1: 0

2: 3

3: 9

4: 4

5: 4

6: 3

7: 4

8: 5

9: 4

10: 3

11: 3

12: 5

So up to the 10th decimal place: 0.0394434543 (digits 1-10: 0,3,9,4,4,3,4,5,4,3). The 11th digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 0.0394434543.

So the exact answer is sqrt(π/2019), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.0394434543.
