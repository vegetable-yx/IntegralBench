Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of cos(x + cos x) from 0 to π. Let me start by thinking about how to approach this. Hmm, integrating cos of a function that includes both x and cos x inside... That seems tricky. Maybe there's a substitution or some symmetry I can use here?

First, let me write down the integral again: ∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx. Let's see if substitution helps. If I let u = x + cos x, then du/dx would be 1 - sin x. But that doesn't seem to simplify the integral because we still have cos(u) times dx, and du is (1 - sin x) dx, which doesn't directly relate. Maybe integration by parts? Let's consider that. Let me set u = cos(x + cos x) and dv = dx. Then du would be -sin(x + cos x) * (1 - sin x) dx, and v = x. But integrating by parts would lead to x*cos(x + cos x) evaluated from 0 to π minus ∫ x*(-sin(x + cos x))(1 - sin x) dx. That seems even more complicated. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, maybe there's a symmetry in the integral. The limits are from 0 to π. Let me check if the integrand has any symmetry properties. Let's substitute x with π - t. Let x = π - t, so when x = 0, t = π, and when x = π, t = 0. Then dx = -dt. The integral becomes ∫ from π to 0 of cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫₀^π cos(π - t - cos t) dt. Because cos(π - t) is -cos t. So the argument inside the cosine becomes π - t - cos t. Then, using the identity cos(π - θ) = -cos θ, but here the argument is π - t - cos t. Wait, maybe I can write cos(π - t - cos t) as cos(π - (t + cos t))? Wait, no, because it's π - t - cos t, which is π - (t + cos t). So cos(π - (t + cos t)) = -cos(t + cos t). So the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt. But the original integral is ∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx. So if I call the original integral I, then after substitution, I get I = ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt = -I. Therefore, I = -I, which implies 2I = 0, so I = 0. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, let me check that substitution again. Let me do it step by step. Let x = π - t. Then when x=0, t=π; x=π, t=0. So the integral becomes:

I = ∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx = ∫_{t=π}^{t=0} cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫₀^π cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) dt.

Now, cos(π - t) is equal to -cos t, so cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) becomes cos(π - t - cos t). Let me expand that as cos(π - (t + cos t)). Using the identity cos(π - θ) = -cos θ, but wait, cos(π - θ) is actually -cos θ. Wait, no: cos(π - θ) = -cos θ. So cos(π - (t + cos t)) = -cos(t + cos t). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt = -∫₀^π cos(t + cos t) dt = -I. So we have I = -I, which implies 2I = 0, so I = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero. That's the exact answer?

But that seems surprising. Let me verify this. Let's take a numerical approximation to check. If the integral is zero, then numerically integrating cos(x + cos x) from 0 to π should give a value very close to zero. Let me try a simple approximation. Let's split the interval into two parts, from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. But maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, use a calculator or approximate using some method.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me check with x = π/2. The function at x=0: cos(0 + cos 0) = cos(1). At x=π: cos(π + cos π) = cos(π -1) = cos(π -1) ≈ cos(2.1416) ≈ -0.54. But integrating from 0 to π, the positive and negative areas might cancel out. Wait, but the function isn't necessarily odd. Wait, but through the symmetry substitution, we found that the integral equals its negative, so it must be zero. So the exact answer is zero. Then the numerical approximation should be very close to zero. Let me check with a simple numerical method. Let's approximate the integral with a few points. For example, using the midpoint rule with a few intervals. Let's take n=4 intervals. The width h = π/4. The midpoints are at π/8, 3π/8, 5π/8, 7π/8. Compute the function at these points:

At x=π/8: cos(π/8 + cos(π/8)). Let's compute cos(π/8) ≈ 0.9239, so π/8 ≈ 0.3927. So x + cos x ≈ 0.3927 + 0.9239 ≈ 1.3166. cos(1.3166) ≈ 0.2506.

At x=3π/8 ≈ 1.1781. cos(3π/8) ≈ 0.3827. x + cos x ≈ 1.1781 + 0.3827 ≈ 1.5608. cos(1.5608) ≈ 0.0102.

At x=5π/8 ≈ 1.9635. cos(5π/8) ≈ cos(112.5°) ≈ -0.3827. x + cos x ≈ 1.9635 - 0.3827 ≈ 1.5808. cos(1.5808) ≈ -0.0092.

At x=7π/8 ≈ 2.7489. cos(7π/8) ≈ -0.9239. x + cos x ≈ 2.7489 - 0.9239 ≈ 1.825. cos(1.825) ≈ -0.2513.

So the midpoints contributions: 0.2506, 0.0102, -0.0092, -0.2513. Summing these: 0.2506 + 0.0102 = 0.2608; -0.0092 -0.2513 = -0.2605. Total sum ≈ 0.2608 -0.2605 ≈ 0.0003. Multiply by h=π/4 ≈ 0.7854. So approximate integral ≈ 0.0003 * 0.7854 ≈ 0.000236. That's a very small number, close to zero. With just 4 intervals, the approximation is already near zero. If I take more intervals, it would get even closer. So this supports the analytical result that the integral is zero.

Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places. But wait, maybe the integral is exactly zero? Let me check with another substitution. Suppose we split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Let me see if there's a way to pair terms. Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = π - t as before. But we already did that and found that I = -I, so I=0. So the exact answer is 0. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. But maybe the integral isn't exactly zero? Wait, but according to the substitution, it's exactly zero. Let me check with another approach. Let me consider expanding cos(x + cos x) using the cosine addition formula: cos(x + cos x) = cos x cos(cos x) - sin x sin(cos x). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^π [cos x cos(cos x) - sin x sin(cos x)] dx. Let's split this into two integrals: I1 = ∫₀^π cos x cos(cos x) dx and I2 = ∫₀^π sin x sin(cos x) dx. Let's compute I1 and I2 separately.

For I1: Let me make substitution u = cos x. Then du = -sin x dx. But the integrand is cos x cos(cos x). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let me set u = cos(cos x), dv = cos x dx. Then du = sin(cos x) * sin x dx, and v = sin x. So integration by parts gives uv|₀^π - ∫₀^π v du = [sin x cos(cos x)] from 0 to π - ∫₀^π sin x * sin(cos x) * sin x dx. Evaluating the boundary terms: at x=π, sin π = 0, so term is 0. At x=0, sin 0 = 0. So the first term is 0. Therefore, I1 = - ∫₀^π sin²x sin(cos x) dx. Hmm, not sure if that helps. But then I1 = - ∫ sin²x sin(cos x) dx. Then the original integral I = I1 - I2 = - ∫ sin²x sin(cos x) dx - ∫ sin x sin(cos x) dx. That seems more complex. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, let's look at I2: ∫ sin x sin(cos x) dx. Let substitution u = cos x, then du = -sin x dx. So I2 = - ∫_{u=1}^{u=-1} sin(cos x) (-du) = ∫_{-1}^{1} sin u du. Because when x=0, u=cos 0=1; x=π, u=cos π=-1. So I2 = ∫_{-1}^1 sin u du = -cos u |_{-1}^1 = -cos 1 + cos(-1) = -cos 1 + cos 1 = 0. Because cos is even, so cos(-1)=cos 1. Therefore, I2 = 0. So the original integral I = I1 - I2 = I1 - 0 = I1. But earlier, we found that I1 = - ∫ sin²x sin(cos x) dx. But how does that help? Wait, but if I1 is equal to that integral, and we also have from the previous substitution that I = -I, so I=0. Therefore, combining these results, I1 must be zero. Therefore, the integral I is zero. So this confirms the earlier result.

Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. So the final answer should be {"answer": "0", "numerical_answer": "0.0000000000"}.
