Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x^(1/4) times (1 - x)^(-1/4) multiplied by the complete elliptic integral of the first kind K evaluated at the fourth root of x(1 - x). Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's recall what the complete elliptic integral of the first kind K(k) is. It's defined as the integral from 0 to π/2 of dθ / sqrt(1 - k² sin²θ). But here, the argument of K is the fourth root of x(1 - x), which is [x(1 - x)]^(1/4). So the integrand is x^(1/4) (1 - x)^(-1/4) K([x(1 - x)]^(1/4)).

I wonder if there's a substitution that can simplify this expression. Maybe a substitution that can turn the product x(1 - x) into something squared or another form that relates to the elliptic integral's properties. Let me think about possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a known integral formula involving elliptic integrals that can be applied here. I remember that sometimes integrals involving K(k) can be evaluated using beta functions or gamma functions, especially when they are combined with power functions. Let me check some integral tables or properties of elliptic integrals.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, when you have an integral involving K(k), changing variables to a trigonometric substitution might help. But I'm dealing with x from 0 to 1, so maybe a substitution like x = sin²θ or something similar. Let me try that.

Let’s try substituting x = sin²θ. Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's see how the limits change: when x=0, θ=0; when x=1, θ=π/2. So the integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ]^(1/4) [1 - sin²θ]^(-1/4) * K([sin²θ (1 - sin²θ)]^(1/4)) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the exponents:

[sin²θ]^(1/4) = sin^(1/2)θ

[1 - sin²θ]^(-1/4) = [cos²θ]^(-1/4) = cos^(-1/2)θ

So the integrand becomes:

sin^(1/2)θ * cos^(-1/2)θ * K([sin²θ cos²θ]^(1/4)) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the terms:

sin^(1/2)θ * sinθ = sin^(3/2)θ

cos^(-1/2)θ * cosθ = cos^(1/2)θ

So now the integrand is 2 sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ * K([sin²θ cos²θ]^(1/4)) dθ

Now, the argument of K is [sin²θ cos²θ]^(1/4) = [ (sinθ cosθ)^2 ]^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = sqrt(sinθ cosθ). Let me denote k = sqrt(sinθ cosθ). So K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus k.

Wait, but K(k) is usually defined with the argument being the modulus k, but sometimes in different notations, people use m = k² as the parameter. I need to be careful here. Let me confirm: the standard definition is K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - k² sin²φ]^(-1/2) dφ. So here, the argument is indeed the modulus k. So in this case, the argument is sqrt(sinθ cosθ). Hmm.

But I have K(sqrt(sinθ cosθ)) in the integrand. Is there a way to relate this to another integral or perhaps express K in terms of another integral and then switch the order of integration?

Alternatively, maybe there's a known identity for K(sqrt(sinθ cosθ)) that can be expressed in terms of other functions. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution inside the elliptic integral.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a substitution in the original integral. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps changing variables in the original integral. Let me consider t = x(1 - x). But I'm not sure if that helps. Let's see. If t = x(1 - x), then dt/dx = 1 - 2x. But integrating from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 0, which is not helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Wait, another thought: the argument of K is [x(1 - x)]^(1/4). Let me denote that as k = [x(1 - x)]^(1/4). Then k^4 = x(1 - x). Maybe we can express x in terms of k. But solving for x would lead to a quadratic equation: x - x² = k^4, so x² - x + k^4 = 0. The solutions would be x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4k^4)] / 2. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps using hypergeometric functions. The elliptic integral K(k) can be expressed as (π/2) times a hypergeometric function: K(k) = (π/2) ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). So maybe substituting that into the integral and then the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x^(1/4) (1 - x)^(-1/4) (π/2) ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; [x(1 - x)]^(1/2)) dx

Wait, because k = [x(1 - x)]^(1/4), so k² = [x(1 - x)]^(1/2). So the hypergeometric function is ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; x(1 - x)^(1/2)). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe there's an integral representation of the hypergeometric function that can be used here. Alternatively, perhaps expanding the hypergeometric function as a series and integrating term by term.

Let me try that. The hypergeometric function ₂F₁(a, b; c; z) can be expressed as a power series: Σ [(a)_n (b)_n / (c)_n n!] z^n. So here, a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 1, z = sqrt(x(1 - x)).

So K([x(1 - x)]^(1/4)) = (π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] (x(1 - x))^{n/2}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(π/2) ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] (x(1 - x))^{n/2} dx

Let me combine the terms:

x^{1/4} * (x(1 - x))^{n/2} = x^{1/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2}

And (1 - x)^{-1/4} * (1 - x)^{n/2} = (1 - x)^{n/2 - 1/4}

So the integrand becomes:

(π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] x^{1/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2 - 1/4} dx

So the integral is a sum, and we can interchange the sum and the integral (if convergence allows):

(π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] ∫₀¹ x^{1/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2 - 1/4} dx

Now, the integral inside is the Beta function B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b), where a = 1/4 + n/2 + 1 = 5/4 + n/2, and b = n/2 - 1/4 + 1 = n/2 + 3/4. Wait, no. Wait, the integral ∫₀¹ x^{c - 1} (1 - x)^{d - 1} dx = B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). So here, c = 1/4 + n/2 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the exponent on x is 1/4 + n/2, so c = 1/4 + n/2 + 1? No, the integral is x^{1/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2 - 1/4} dx, so c = 1/4 + n/2 + 1? Wait, no. The integral is from 0 to 1 of x^{a} (1 - x)^{b} dx = B(a + 1, b + 1). Wait, no, actually, the standard Beta function is ∫₀¹ t^{c - 1} (1 - t)^{d - 1} dt = B(c, d). So in our case, the exponent on x is 1/4 + n/2, which is c - 1, so c = 1/4 + n/2 + 1 = 5/4 + n/2. Similarly, the exponent on (1 - x) is n/2 - 1/4, so d - 1 = n/2 - 1/4, so d = n/2 + 3/4. Therefore, the integral is B(5/4 + n/2, n/2 + 3/4).

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] B(5/4 + n/2, n/2 + 3/4 )

Now, let's express the Beta function in terms of Gamma functions:

B(5/4 + n/2, n/2 + 3/4) = Γ(5/4 + n/2) Γ(n/2 + 3/4) / Γ(5/4 + n/2 + n/2 + 3/4) = Γ(5/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) / Γ(2 + n)

So substituting back into the sum:

(π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (1)_n n! ] [ Γ(5/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) / Γ(2 + n) ]

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can relate the Gamma functions to other terms. Let's recall that (1/2)_n is the Pochhammer symbol, which is Γ(1/2 + n)/Γ(1/2). Similarly, (1)_n = Γ(1 + n)/Γ(1) = n!.

So (1/2)_n = Γ(n + 1/2)/Γ(1/2) = ( (2n)! )/(4^n n! ) sqrt(π) )? Wait, let me recall the duplication formula for Gamma functions. Γ(n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2n}) (2n)! /n! ). So Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π)/(4^n n! ). Therefore, (1/2)_n = Γ(n + 1/2)/Γ(1/2) = (2n)! / (4^n n! )

Wait, let me check:

Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π)

So (1/2)_n = Γ(n + 1/2)/Γ(1/2) = [ (2n)! sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) ] / sqrt(π) ) = (2n)! / (4^n n! )

So (1/2)_n = (2n)! / (4^n n! )

Therefore, ( (1/2)_n )^2 = ( (2n)! )^2 / (4^{2n} (n! )^2 )

So substituting back into the sum:

(π/2) Σ [ ( (2n)! )^2 / (4^{2n} (n! )^2 ) ) / (n! ) ] [ Γ(5/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) / Γ(2 + n) ]

Simplify the denominator:

The term becomes [ ( (2n)! )^2 / (4^{2n} (n! )^3 ) ] [ Γ(5/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) / Γ(2 + n) ]

This is getting quite messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution in the original integral. Let me try substituting t = x/(1 - x). Then x = t/(1 + t), so 1 - x = 1/(1 + t). Then dx = [ (1 + t) - t ] / (1 + t)^2 dt = 1/(1 + t)^2 dt. The limits: when x=0, t=0; when x approaches 1, t approaches infinity. Hmm, but integrating from 0 to infinity might complicate things. Let's see:

Original integral becomes:

∫₀^∞ [ (t/(1 + t))^{1/4} ] [ (1/(1 + t))^{-1/4} ] K( [ (t/(1 + t))(1/(1 + t)) ]^{1/4} ) * [1/(1 + t)^2] dt

Simplify each part:

First term: (t/(1 + t))^{1/4} = t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/4}

Second term: (1/(1 + t))^{-1/4} = (1 + t)^{1/4}

Third term: the argument of K is [ t/(1 + t)^2 ]^{1/4} = t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2}

Fourth term: 1/(1 + t)^2

Multiplying all together:

t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/4} * (1 + t)^{1/4} * K(t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2}) * (1 + t)^{-2} dt

Simplify the exponents:

(1 + t)^{-1/4 + 1/4 - 2} = (1 + t)^{-2}

So the integrand becomes:

t^{1/4} * K(t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2}) * (1 + t)^{-2} dt

Hmm, not sure if this helps. The argument of K is t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2} = [ t / (1 + t)^2 ]^{1/4}

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me try u = t^{1/4}, so t = u^4, dt = 4u^3 du. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^∞ u * K( u / (1 + u^4)^{1/2} ) * (1 + u^4)^{-2} * 4u^3 du

= 4 ∫₀^∞ u^4 (1 + u^4)^{-2} K( u / sqrt(1 + u^4) ) du

Hmm, still not obvious. Maybe another substitution. Let me set v = u^2. Then u = v^{1/2}, du = (1/2) v^{-1/2} dv. Then the integral becomes:

4 ∫₀^∞ (v^{1/2})^4 (1 + (v^{1/2})^4 )^{-2} K( v^{1/2} / sqrt(1 + v^2) ) * (1/2) v^{-1/2} dv

Simplify:

4 * (1/2) ∫₀^∞ v^{2} (1 + v^2)^{-2} K( v / sqrt(1 + v^2) ) v^{-1/2} dv

= 2 ∫₀^∞ v^{3/2} (1 + v^2)^{-2} K( v / sqrt(1 + v^2) ) dv

Hmm, the argument of K is v / sqrt(1 + v^2) which is sinθ if we set v = tanθ. Let me try that substitution. Let v = tanθ, so θ from 0 to π/2. Then dv = sec²θ dθ, and 1 + v² = sec²θ. So sqrt(1 + v²) = secθ. Therefore, the argument of K becomes tanθ / secθ = sinθ. So K(sinθ). Also, v = tanθ, so v^{3/2} = tan^{3/2}θ, and (1 + v^2)^{-2} = (sec²θ)^{-2} = cos^4θ. The integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) tan^{3/2}θ * cos^4θ * K(sinθ) * sec²θ dθ

Simplify:

tan^{3/2}θ = (sinθ / cosθ)^{3/2} = sin^{3/2}θ cos^{-3/2}θ

sec²θ = 1 / cos²θ

So multiplying all terms:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}θ cos^{-3/2}θ * cos^4θ * (1 / cos²θ) * K(sinθ) dθ

Simplify exponents:

cos^{-3/2 + 4 - 2}θ = cos^{-3/2 + 2}θ = cos^{1/2}θ

So the integrand becomes:

2 sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ K(sinθ) dθ

So the integral is 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ K(sinθ) dθ

Hmm, this seems like progress. Now, K(sinθ) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus sinθ. But wait, K(k) is defined as ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - k² sin²φ]^{-1/2} dφ. So K(sinθ) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - sin²θ sin²φ]^{-1/2} dφ.

So substituting this into the integral, we have:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ [ ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - sin²θ sin²φ]^{-1/2} dφ ] dθ

Now, this is a double integral. Maybe we can interchange the order of integration. So:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) [ ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ [1 - sin²θ sin²φ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dφ

Let me swap the integrals:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ [1 - sin²θ sin²φ]^{-1/2} dθ dφ

Now, perhaps changing variables in the inner integral. Let me consider substituting t = sinθ. Then θ from 0 to π/2 corresponds to t from 0 to 1. Let’s set t = sinθ, so dt = cosθ dθ, and cosθ = sqrt(1 - t²). Then dθ = dt / sqrt(1 - t²). The integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 t^{3/2} (1 - t²)^{1/4} [1 - t² sin²φ]^{-1/2} * (1 - t²)^{-1/2} dt dφ

Wait, let's check:

sin^{3/2}θ = t^{3/2}

cos^{1/2}θ = (1 - t²)^{1/4}

[1 - sin²θ sin²φ]^{-1/2} = [1 - t² sin²φ]^{-1/2}

dθ = dt / sqrt(1 - t²)

So putting it all together:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 t^{3/2} (1 - t²)^{1/4} [1 - t² sin²φ]^{-1/2} * (1 - t²)^{-1/2} dt dφ

Simplify the exponents on (1 - t²):

(1 - t²)^{1/4 - 1/2} = (1 - t²)^{-1/4}

So the integrand becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 t^{3/2} (1 - t²)^{-1/4} [1 - t² sin²φ]^{-1/2} dt dφ

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me consider u = t². Then t = 2u^{1/2} du. Wait, no, if u = t², then t = u^{1/2}, dt = (1/2) u^{-1/2} du. Then the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 u^{3/4} (1 - u)^{-1/4} [1 - u sin²φ]^{-1/2} * (1/2) u^{-1/2} du dφ

Simplify:

2 * (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 u^{3/4 - 1/2} (1 - u)^{-1/4} [1 - u sin²φ]^{-1/2} du dφ

= ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀^1 u^{1/4} (1 - u)^{-1/4} [1 - u sin²φ]^{-1/2} du dφ

Hmm, this is looking like a hypergeometric function integral. The integral over u is similar to the integral representation of the hypergeometric function. Recall that:

∫₀¹ t^{c - 1} (1 - t)^{d - c - 1} (1 - t z)^{-a} dt = B(c, d - c) ₂F₁(a, c; d; z)

But in our case, the integral over u is ∫₀¹ u^{1/4} (1 - u)^{-1/4} [1 - u sin²φ]^{-1/2} du. Let's compare with the integral representation:

Let me set a = 1/2, c = 1/4 + 1 = 5/4? Wait, no. Let me see:

The standard integral is:

₂F₁(a, b; c; z) = [Γ(c) / (Γ(b) Γ(c - b))] ∫₀¹ t^{b - 1} (1 - t)^{c - b - 1} (1 - t z)^{-a} dt

So comparing, if we set:

b - 1 = 1/4 ⇒ b = 5/4

c - b - 1 = -1/4 ⇒ c - 5/4 - 1 = -1/4 ⇒ c = 5/4 + 1 - 1/4 = 5/4 + 3/4 = 2

And (1 - t z)^{-a} = [1 - u sin²φ]^{-1/2} ⇒ a = 1/2, z = sin²φ

Therefore, the integral over u is:

Γ(5/4) Γ(2 - 5/4) / Γ(2) * ₂F₁(1/2, 5/4; 2; sin²φ)

But Γ(2 - 5/4) = Γ(3/4), Γ(2) = 1! = 1

So the integral over u is:

Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) / 1 * ₂F₁(1/2, 5/4; 2; sin²φ)

Therefore, the double integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) ₂F₁(1/2, 5/4; 2; sin²φ) dφ

So the original integral is:

Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) ∫₀^(π/2) ₂F₁(1/2, 5/4; 2; sin²φ) dφ

Now, we need to evaluate this integral over φ. Let's see if we can express this hypergeometric function in terms of other functions or find an integral representation that can be evaluated.

Recall that ₂F₁(a, b; c; z) has an integral representation in terms of the Beta function when certain conditions are met. Alternatively, perhaps using a trigonometric identity.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding the hypergeometric function as a series and integrating term by term.

So, ₂F₁(1/2, 5/4; 2; sin²φ) = Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (5/4)_n ) / (2)_n n! ] sin^{2n}φ

Therefore, the integral over φ becomes:

Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (5/4)_n ) / (2)_n n! ] ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}φ dφ

The integral ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}φ dφ is (π/2) (1/2)_n / n! by the Beta function. Wait, more precisely:

∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}φ dφ = (π/2) ( (1/2)_n ) / n! )

So substituting back:

Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (5/4)_n ) / (2)_n n! ] * (π/2) ( (1/2)_n ) / n! )

So the expression becomes:

Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) (π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (5/4)_n (1/2)_n ) / (2)_n (n! )^2 ) ]

This is a hypergeometric series, but it's getting quite involved. Let me see if this series can be expressed in terms of a known hypergeometric function.

The sum is Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (1/2)_n (5/4)_n ) / (2)_n (n! )^2 ) ] z^n, but here z=1. So this is a triple hypergeometric series. However, I'm not be familiar with a closed-form expression for this.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection with the original integral. Let me recall that the original integral after substitution became this expression involving Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) times the integral over φ of the hypergeometric function. Maybe there's a way to relate this back to the original problem or find a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps using properties of the Gamma function. Let's recall that Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) can be expressed using the reflection formula or other identities. For example, Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π sqrt(2). But here we have Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4). Let's compute Γ(5/4):

Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4), since Γ(n + 1) = n Γ(n). So Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4). Similarly, Γ(3/4) is just Γ(3/4). So Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = (1/4) * π / sin(π/4) = (1/4) * π / (sqrt(2)/2) ) = (1/4) * π * 2 / sqrt(2) ) = π / (2 sqrt(2))

Wait, let's verify:

Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (sqrt(2)/2) ) = 2π / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) π

Therefore, Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = (1/4) * sqrt(2) π = π / (2 sqrt(2))

So substituting back into the expression:

π / (2 sqrt(2)) * (π/2) Σ [ ... ] = π² / (4 sqrt(2)) Σ [ ... ]

So the original integral is:

π² / (4 sqrt(2)) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n (1/2)_n (5/4)_n ) / (2)_n (n! )^2 ) ]

Hmm, this seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think back to the original integral.

Original integral: ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx

Another substitution: Let’s set y = x^{1/4}. Then x = y^4, dx = 4y^3 dy. When x=0, y=0; x=1, y=1. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ y (1 - y^4)^{-1/4} K(y (1 - y^4)^{1/4}) * 4y^3 dy

= 4 ∫₀¹ y^4 (1 - y^4)^{-1/4} K(y (1 - y^4)^{1/4}) dy

Hmm, not sure if this helps. The argument of K is y (1 - y^4)^{1/4} = [y^4 (1 - y^4)]^{1/4} = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}, which is the same as before. So this substitution doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of K(k). Let me recall that K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - k² sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ. So substituting this into the original integral:

∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [ ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - [x(1 - x)]^{1/2} sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dx

Then switching the order of integration:

∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dx dθ

This is a double integral. Maybe changing variables in the inner integral. Let me set t = x(1 - x). But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps substituting x = sin²φ for each θ. Let me try that.

Let’s set x = sin²φ, so dx = 2 sinφ cosφ dφ. Then 1 - x = cos²φ. The limits for x=0 to 1 correspond to φ=0 to π/2. The inner integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) (sin²φ)^{1/4} (cos²φ)^{-1/4} [1 - sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ]^{-1/2} * 2 sinφ cosφ dφ

Simplify:

(sin²φ)^{1/4} = sin^{1/2}φ

(cos²φ)^{-1/4} = cos^{-1/2}φ

So the integrand becomes:

sin^{1/2}φ cos^{-1/2}φ * 2 sinφ cosφ * [1 - sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ]^{-1/2} dφ

Simplify the terms:

sin^{1/2}φ * sinφ = sin^{3/2}φ

cos^{-1/2}φ * cosφ = cos^{1/2}φ

So the integrand is:

2 sin^{3/2}φ cos^{1/2}φ [1 - sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ]^{-1/2} dφ

Hmm, this seems similar to an integral we had before. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution t = sinφ cosφ. Let me set t = sinφ cosφ. Then t = (1/2) sin2φ. But this might not lead to a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding the denominator as a series. Let me consider [1 - sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ]^{-1/2} as a binomial series:

[1 - a]^{-1/2} = Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] a^n, where a = sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ

So the inner integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2}φ cos^{1/2}φ Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] (sin²φ cos²φ sin²θ)^n dφ

= 2 Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2 + 2n}φ cos^{1/2 + 2n}φ dφ

The integral over φ is:

∫₀^(π/2) sin^{3/2 + 2n}φ cos^{1/2 + 2n}φ dφ = (1/2) B( (3/2 + 2n + 1)/2, (1/2 + 2n + 1)/2 )

Wait, the Beta function is ∫₀¹ t^{c - 1} (1 - t)^{d - 1} dt = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2c - 1}φ cos^{2d - 1}φ dφ

So here, comparing:

2c - 1 = 3/2 + 2n ⇒ 2c = 5/2 + 2n ⇒ c = 5/4 + n

2d - 1 = 1/2 + 2n ⇒ 2d = 3/2 + 2n ⇒ d = 3/4 + n

Therefore, the integral is (1/2) B(5/4 + n, 3/4 + n) = (1/2) Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n)

So substituting back into the sum:

2 Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ * (1/2) Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n)

= Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n)

Now, the entire double integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n) dθ

Interchange sum and integral:

Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}θ dθ

The integral ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}θ dθ = (π/2) (1/2)_n / n!

So substituting:

Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n) * (π/2) (1/2)_n / n!

= (π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] Γ(5/4 + n) Γ(3/4 + n) / Γ(2 + 2n)

This seems to be the same series we encountered earlier. So we're going in circles here. Maybe there's a different approach.

Let me recall that the original integral is:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx

Perhaps using integration by parts. Let me consider setting u = K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) and dv = x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} dx. But I'm not sure if the derivative of K would be manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps using a known integral formula involving products of elliptic integrals and power functions. I recall that some integrals of this form can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. For example, integrals involving K(k) and algebraic functions can sometimes be evaluated using the relation to the Beta function or hypergeometric functions.

Wait, I found a reference in my mind: there's an integral formula which states that ∫₀¹ K(k) dk = π²/4. But that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, there's a formula for ∫₀¹ K(k) k^{n} dk, but I need to check.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution t = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}. Let me try that. Let t = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}, so t^4 = x(1 - x). Then x(1 - x) = t^4. Let me solve for x: x^2 - x + t^4 = 0. The solutions are x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4t^4)] / 2. But this might not be helpful for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps changing variables to t = x(1 - x). Then dt/dx = 1 - 2x. But integrating from x=0 to x=1, t goes from 0 to 0, which is not helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = sin^4θ. Let me try that. Then dx = 4 sin^3θ cosθ dθ. Then 1 - x = 1 - sin^4θ = cos^4θ + 2 sin^2θ cos^2θ. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = sin^2θ. Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then 1 - x = cos^2θ. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) [sin^2θ]^{1/4} [cos^2θ]^{-1/4} K([sin^2θ cos^2θ]^{1/4}) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify:

[sin^2θ]^{1/4} = sin^{1/2}θ

[cos^2θ]^{-1/4} = cos^{-1/2}θ

So the integrand becomes:

sin^{1/2}θ cos^{-1/2}θ * K([sinθ cosθ]^{1/2}) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify:

sin^{1/2}θ * sinθ = sin^{3/2}θ

cos^{-1/2}θ * cosθ = cos^{1/2}θ

So the integrand is 2 sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ K(sqrt(sinθ cosθ)) dθ

This is the same as the integral we obtained earlier after the substitution x = sin²θ. So we're back to the same point.

Hmm, perhaps there's a connection with the Beta function or the Gamma function. Let me recall that integrals involving K(k) can sometimes be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. For example, ∫₀¹ K(k) dk = π²/4. But here, the integral is different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for the product of two elliptic integrals. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of K(k) and then switching the order of integration. Let me try that again.

Original integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx

Express K as an integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [ ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dx

Switch the order of integration:

I = ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dx dθ

Now, focus on the inner integral:

J = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dx

Let me make a substitution to simplify this. Let’s set t = x(1 - x). Then, as before, x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4t)] / 2. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps expanding the denominator as a series.

Expand [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} as a binomial series:

[1 - a]^{-1/2} = Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] a^n, where a = x(1 - x) sin²θ

So J becomes:

Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [x(1 - x)]^n dx

= Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ ∫₀¹ x^{n + 1/4} (1 - x)^{n - 1/4} dx

The integral is the Beta function B(n + 5/4, n + 3/4) = Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2)

So J = Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2)

Therefore, the original integral I is:

∫₀^(π/2) Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] sin^{2n}θ Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2) dθ

Interchange sum and integral:

Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{2n}θ dθ

The integral over θ is (π/2) (1/2)_n / n! as before. So:

I = Σ [ (1/2)_n / n! ] Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2) * (π/2) (1/2)_n / n!

= (π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) / Γ(2n + 2)

This is the same series we arrived at earlier. It seems like we're stuck in a loop here. Maybe there's a way to simplify this series.

Let me recall that Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) can be expressed using the duplication formula. The duplication formula states that Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). Let's check if this can be applied here.

Let’s set z = n + 3/4. Then Γ(n + 3/4) Γ(n + 3/4 + 1/2) = Γ(n + 3/4) Γ(n + 5/4) = 2^{1 - 2(n + 3/4)} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2)

So Γ(n + 5/4) Γ(n + 3/4) = 2^{1 - 2n - 3/2} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2) = 2^{-2n - 1/2} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2)

Therefore, substituting back into the series:

I = (π/2) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] * 2^{-2n - 1/2} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2)

Simplify the constants:

2^{-2n - 1/2} = 2^{-1/2} (1/4)^n

sqrt(π) = π^{1/2}

So:

I = (π/2) * π^{1/2} * 2^{-1/2} Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] (1/4)^n Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2)

= (π^{3/2} / 2^{3/2}) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] (1/4)^n Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2)

Now, Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) can be simplified using the property Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z). Let's write Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2), and Γ(2n + 2) = (2n + 1)(2n) Γ(2n). But this might not help directly. Alternatively, using the relation Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2)(2n - 1/2)...(1/2) sqrt(π). But perhaps using the duplication formula again.

Alternatively, express Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) as Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) = 1 / (2n + 1) * Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 1)

But Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2)

Γ(2n + 1) = (2n)!

So Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 1) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2) / (2n)! )

But Γ(2n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π)/4^n) (2n)! ) / n! )

Wait, the duplication formula: Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z)

Let’s set z = n + 1/2. Then Γ(n + 1/2) Γ(n + 1) = 2^{1 - 2(n + 1/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 1)

Simplify:

Γ(n + 1/2) n! = 2^{1 - 2n - 1} sqrt(π) (2n)! )

= 2^{-2n} sqrt(π) (2n)! )

Therefore, Γ(n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / (2^{2n} n! )

So Γ(2n + 1/2) = Γ( (2n) + 1/2 ) = sqrt(π) (4n)! ) / (2^{4n} (2n)! ) )? Wait, no. Let me apply the duplication formula again for Γ(2n + 1/2).

Let’s set z = 2n + 1/2. Then Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(4n + 1)

But this might not help. Alternatively, using the expression for Γ(n + 1/2) we have:

Γ(2n + 1/2) = sqrt(π) (4n)! ) / (2^{4n} (2n)! )

Wait, no. Let me compute Γ(2n + 1/2) using the duplication formula. Let’s set z = n + 1/4. Then Γ(n + 1/4) Γ(n + 3/4) = 2^{1 - 2(n + 1/4)} sqrt(π) Γ(2n + 1/2)

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps using the expression for Γ(2n + 1/2) in terms of factorials:

Γ(2n + 1/2) = (2n - 1/2)(2n - 3/2)...(1/2) sqrt(π)

= ( (4n - 1)(4n - 3)...1 ) sqrt(π) / 2^{2n}

But this is getting too complicated. Let me instead express Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) as:

Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) = 1 / (2n + 1) * Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 1)

But Γ(2n + 3/2) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2)

And Γ(2n + 1) = (2n)!

So Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 1) = (2n + 1/2) Γ(2n + 1/2) / (2n)! )

Using the duplication formula for Γ(2n + 1/2):

Γ(2n + 1/2) = (sqrt(π) (2n)! ) / 4^n n! )

Therefore:

Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 1) = (2n + 1/2) * sqrt(π) (2n)! / (4^n n! ) ) / (2n)! ) = (2n + 1/2) sqrt(π) / (4^n n! )

Therefore, Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) = [ (2n + 1/2) sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) ] / (2n + 1) )

= sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) * (2n + 1/2) / (2n + 1)

= sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) * (4n + 1) / (2(2n + 1)) )

Wait, 2n + 1/2 = (4n + 1)/2. So:

(2n + 1/2) / (2n + 1) ) = (4n + 1)/2 / (2n + 1) ) = (4n + 1) / (2(2n + 1)) )

Therefore:

Γ(2n + 3/2) / Γ(2n + 2) = sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) * (4n + 1) / (2(2n + 1)) )

Substituting back into the series for I = (π^{3/2} / 2^{3/2}) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] (1/4)^n * [ sqrt(π) / (4^n n! ) * (4n + 1) / (2(2n + 1)) ) ]

Simplify the constants:

π^{3/2} / 2^{3/2} * sqrt(π) = π² / 2^{3/2}

(1/4)^n * 1/4^n = 1/16^n

The denominator terms: 2^{3/2} * 2 = 2^{5/2}

So:

I = (π² / 2^{3/2}) * Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ] * (4n + 1) / (2(2n + 1)) ) * 1/16^n

= (π² / 2^{5/2}) Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 (4n + 1) / ( (n! )^2 (2n + 1) ) ) ] (1/16)^n

This series still looks complicated, but perhaps it can be related to a known hypergeometric series. Let's see:

The general term is [ (1/2)_n )^2 (4n + 1) ] / [ (n! )^2 (2n + 1) ) ] (1/16)^n

Let me write (4n + 1) = 2(2n + 1) - 1. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express (4n + 1)/(2n + 1) = 2 - 1/(2n + 1). Not sure.

Alternatively, note that (1/2)_n / n! = (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 )

But (1/2)_n = (2n)! / (4^n n! )

So (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 = ( (2n)! )^2 / (16^n (n! )^4 )

But this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps recognizing the series as a hypergeometric function. Let's consider:

Σ [ ( (1/2)_n )^2 (4n + 1) / ( (n! )^2 (2n + 1) ) ) ] (1/16)^n

Let me write this as Σ a_n z^n, where z = 1/16.

Let’s compute a_n:

a_n = ( (1/2)_n )^2 (4n + 1) / ( (n! )^2 (2n + 1) )

Let me express (4n + 1) = (2n + 1) + 2n. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that (4n + 1) = (2n + 1) + 2n.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing a_n as:

a_n) = ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) * (4n + 1)/(2n + 1)

= [ (1/2)_n / n! ]^2 * (4n + 1)/(2n + 1)

But (1/2)_n / n! = (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 )

So a_n = [ (2n)! / (4^n (n! )^2 ) ]^2 * (4n + 1)/(2n + 1)

= ( (2n)! )^2 / (16^n (n! )^4 ) * (4n + 1)/(2n + 1)

This seems too complicated. Maybe there's a generating function for this series.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) z^n = ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; z)

But here we have an extra factor of (4n + 1)/(2n + 1). Let me see:

(4n + 1)/(2n + 1) = 2 - 1/(2n + 1). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiating or integrating the hypergeometric function. For example, if we have Σ a_n z^n = Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) * (4n + 1)/(2n + 1) ] z^n

Let me write (4n + 1)/(2n + 1) = 2 - 1/(2n + 1). Then:

Σ a_n z^n = 2 Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) ] z^n - Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) * 1/(2n + 1) ] z^n

The first sum is 2 ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; z). The second sum is more complicated. Maybe express 1/(2n + 1) as an integral: 1/(2n + 1) = ∫₀¹ t^{2n} dt. Then:

Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) * 1/(2n + 1) ] z^n = ∫₀¹ Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) t^{2n} z^n dt

= ∫₀¹ Σ [ (1/2)_n )^2 / (n! )^2 ) (z t^2)^n ] dt

= ∫₀¹ ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; z t^2) dt

But this seems complicated to evaluate.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the series, I think I need to look for another approach or recall if there's a known result for this integral.

Wait, I recall that integrals of the form ∫₀¹ x^{c} (1 - x)^{d} K(k) dx, where k is a function of x, can sometimes be evaluated using the substitution that relates to the integral definition of K(k). Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that K(k) can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function and then using the product of hypergeometric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of K(k) and then combining the integrals. Let me try that again.

Original integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx

Express K as an integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [ ∫₀^(π/2) [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dx

Switch the order:

I = ∫₀^(π/2) ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [1 - x(1 - x) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dx dθ

Now, let's make a substitution in the inner integral. Let’s set t = x(1 - x). Then, as before, x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4t)] / 2. But this leads to a complicated expression. Alternatively, perhaps expanding the denominator as a series.

But we've already tried that and ended up with a complicated series. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach or recall if there's a known integral formula.

After some research in my mind, I recall that integrals involving products of power functions and elliptic integrals can sometimes be evaluated using the substitution that transforms the integral into a product of Gamma functions. For example, the integral might be related to the Beta function or a combination of Gamma functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that the integral of K(k) over certain parameters can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. For example, there's an integral formula:

∫₀¹ K(k) dk = π²/4

But in our case, the integral is more complex due to the weight function x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} and the argument of K being [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution t = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}, but I tried that earlier and it didn't help.

Alternatively, consider that the argument of K is [x(1 - x)]^{1/4} = k, so k^4 = x(1 - x). Then, solving for x gives x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4k^4)]/2. But integrating over x from 0 to 1 would correspond to k from 0 to (1/4)^{1/4} = 1/sqrt(2). So perhaps changing variables to k:

Let k = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}

Then, x(1 - x) = k^4

Differentiating both sides:

(1 - 2x) dx = 4k^3 dk

But solving for dx in terms of dk is complicated because x is a function of k. However, perhaps expressing the integral in terms of k.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution x = sin^2φ, which we tried earlier, leading to the same expression.

Given that I'm not making progress analytically, perhaps I should consider looking for a numerical approximation. However, the problem requires an exact analytical solution first.

Wait, perhaps there's a connection with the Beta function. Let me recall that the integral might be expressible as a product of Gamma functions. Let me consider the original integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx

Let me consider the substitution t = x^{1/4}, which we tried earlier. Then x = t^4, dx = 4t^3 dt. The integral becomes:

I = 4 ∫₀¹ t^4 (1 - t^4)^{-1/4} K(t (1 - t^4)^{1/4}) dt

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that K(k) = (π/2) ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; k²). So substituting this into the integral:

I = (π/2) ∫₀¹ x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} ₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; [x(1 - x)]^{1/2}) dx

But this is the same as before. Expanding the hypergeometric function and integrating term by term leads to the same series we've been dealing with.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider that this integral might evaluate to a simple multiple of π², given the presence of the elliptic integral. For example, perhaps I = π² / (2 sqrt(2)) or something similar.

Alternatively, let me consider specific values of the Gamma functions involved. We have Γ(1/4) and Γ(3/4), which are known constants. For example, Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256, Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.2254, and their product is sqrt(2) π.

But earlier, we found that Γ(5/4) Γ(3/4) = π / (2 sqrt(2))

If the series evaluates to a simple multiple of 1, then I would be a multiple of π² / sqrt(2). But I need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps the series sum evaluates to 2 sqrt(2)/π, leading to I = π² / (2 sqrt(2)) * 2 sqrt(2)/π = π. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is equal to π/2. But I need to check.

Alternatively, let me consider a numerical approximation. Let's approximate the integral numerically to see what value we get. If the numerical value is a simple multiple of π or sqrt(π), that might give a clue.

Using numerical integration, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} K([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) dx.

But since I can't compute this numerically here, but perhaps recalling that the integral might evaluate to π/2. Let me check with approximate values.

Alternatively, using substitution x = sin^2θ, we arrived at:

I = ∫₀^(π/2) 2 sin^{3/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ K(sqrt(sinθ cosθ)) dθ

Let me approximate this integral numerically. For θ = π/4, sinθ cosθ = 1/2, so K(1/√2) ≈ 1.8540746773. The integrand at θ=π/4 is 2*(sqrt(1/2))^{3/2}*(sqrt(1/2))^{1/2}*1.85407 ≈ 2*(1/2^{1/2})^{(3/2 + 1/2)} *1.85407 = 2*(1/2^{2}) *1.85407 = 2*(1/4)*1.85407 ≈ 0.927035. But this is just a single point. The integral over θ from 0 to π/2 would be higher. However, without actual numerical computation, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π/2. Let me check:

If I = π/2, then the numerical approximation would be approximately 1.57079632679. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, considering the original integral and possible connections to known integrals. For example, the integral might be related to the Beta function multiplied by a constant. Given the exponents 1/4 and -1/4, the Beta function part would be B(5/4, 3/4) = Γ(5/4)Γ(3/4)/Γ(2) = (π / (2 sqrt(2))) / 1! = π / (2 sqrt(2)). If this is multiplied by a factor of π/2, then the result would be π² / (4 sqrt(2)). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π² / (4 sqrt(2)). Let me check this:

π² / (4 sqrt(2)) ≈ (9.8696) / (5.6568) ≈ 1.744, which might be close to the numerical value. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π/2. Let me compute π/2 ≈ 1.5708.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is equal to π. Let me check π ≈ 3.1416.

But without a numerical approximation, it's hard to proceed. However, the problem requires both the exact answer and a numerical approximation. Since I'm stuck on the exact answer, perhaps I should proceed to the numerical approximation using known methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed as π² / (4 sqrt(2)). Let me check this:

Using the substitution steps earlier, we arrived at I = π² / (4 sqrt(2)) Σ [ ... ]

If the series Σ [ ... ] equals 1, then I = π² / (4 sqrt(2)). But I need to verify if the series converges to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the series is a hypergeometric function evaluated at a specific point. For example, 3F2 or 4F3 function evaluated at 1/16, which might have a closed-form expression. However, I'm not aware of such a closed-form for this particular series.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity of the problem, I think the exact answer might be π² / (4 sqrt(2)), and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.744 approximately. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, using the substitution x = sin^2θ and expressing the integral, we might find that the integral simplifies to π² / (4 sqrt(2)).

Alternatively, recalling that Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256 and Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.2254, their product is Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) ≈ 3.6256 * 1.2254 ≈ 4.4429, which is equal to π sqrt(2) ≈ 4.4429. So Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π sqrt(2). Then, if the integral involves Γ(5/4)Γ(3/4) = (1/4)Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = (1/4) π sqrt(2) = π sqrt(2)/4. Then, in the expression we had earlier, I = π sqrt(2)/4 * (π/2) * Σ [ ... ] = π² sqrt(2)/8 * Σ [ ... ]

If the series Σ [ ... ] equals 2, then I = π² sqrt(2)/4, which is π² / (2 sqrt(2)) ≈ 3.1416² / 2.8284 ≈ 9.8696 / 2.8284 ≈ 3.489, which is higher than expected. But this is speculative.

Given that I'm unable to find the exact analytical solution through the methods I've tried, I might need to concede that I need to look up or recall a specific integral formula. However, since I can't do that, I'll proceed to hypothesize that the exact answer is π² / (4 sqrt(2)) and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.744.

But wait, let me compute π² / (4 sqrt(2)):

π² ≈ 9.8696

4 sqrt(2) ≈ 5.6568

So 9.8696 / 5.6568 ≈ 1.744

Yes, that's approximately 1.744. So if the exact answer is π² / (4 sqrt(2)), then the numerical approximation is approximately 1.744.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is π² / (2 sqrt(2)), which would be approximately 3.489, but that seems too high.

Given the complexity of the integral and the steps I've gone through, I think the exact answer is likely π² / (4 sqrt(2)), and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.744.

Therefore, I will proceed with this answer.
