Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times arccos x multiplied by the modified Bessel function of the first kind I_0(2x) dx. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what I know about integrating products of functions like arccos x and Bessel functions. The integral involves x arccos x I_0(2x). I remember that Bessel functions often come up in physics and engineering problems, especially in cylindrical coordinates. The modified Bessel function I_0 is a solution to a specific differential equation. But how do I integrate this?

Maybe I can start by considering integration by parts. The integrand is a product of three functions, but arccos x and I_0(2x) are both non-elementary. Wait, arccos x is an inverse trigonometric function, and I_0 is a Bessel function. Integration by parts might still be possible if I choose u and dv appropriately. Let's see: the formula for integration by parts is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.

Let me try letting u be arccos x. Then du would be -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Then dv would be x I_0(2x) dx. But then I need to find v, which is the integral of x I_0(2x) dx. Hmm, do I know how to integrate x times a Bessel function? Let me check.

I recall that the integral of x^n I_0(x) dx might have a known form. Wait, maybe there's a formula for integrating x I_0(ax) dx. Let me look that up in my mind. I think the integral of x I_0(ax) dx is (x/a) I_1(ax) + C, but I need to verify that. Let me differentiate (x/a) I_1(ax) to see if that gives x I_0(ax). 

The derivative of (x/a) I_1(ax) with respect to x is (1/a) I_1(ax) + (x/a) * d/dx [I_1(ax)]. The derivative of I_1(ax) with respect to x is a I_1'(ax). From Bessel function properties, I remember that the derivative of I_1(z) is (I_0(z) - I_2(z))/2, but maybe more straightforwardly, there's a recurrence relation. Wait, the standard recurrence for modified Bessel functions: I_ν'(z) = I_{ν-1}(z) - (ν/z) I_ν(z). For ν=1, that would be I_1'(z) = I_0(z) - (1/z) I_1(z). So, the derivative of I_1(ax) is a [I_0(ax) - (1/(ax)) I_1(ax)]. 

Putting that back into the derivative of (x/a) I_1(ax):

(1/a) I_1(ax) + (x/a) * a [I_0(ax) - (1/(ax)) I_1(ax)] = (1/a) I_1(ax) + x I_0(ax) - (1/a) I_1(ax) = x I_0(ax). 

Yes! So the integral of x I_0(ax) dx is (x/a) I_1(ax) + C. Therefore, in our case, a=2, so the integral of x I_0(2x) dx is (x/2) I_1(2x) + C. Therefore, if we take dv = x I_0(2x) dx, then v = (x/2) I_1(2x). 

So, going back to integration by parts. Let u = arccos x, dv = x I_0(2x) dx. Then du = -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v = (x/2) I_1(2x). 

Therefore, the integral becomes uv evaluated from 0 to 1 minus the integral from 0 to 1 of v du. So:

∫0^1 x arccos x I_0(2x) dx = [arccos x * (x/2) I_1(2x)] from 0 to 1 - ∫0^1 (x/2) I_1(2x) * (-1)/sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Simplify the boundary terms first. At x=1: arccos(1) is 0, so that term is 0. At x=0: arccos(0) is π/2, and x/2 is 0, so the entire boundary term is 0. Therefore, the integral reduces to:

0 - ∫0^1 (x/2) I_1(2x) * (-1)/sqrt(1 - x²) dx = (1/2) ∫0^1 (x I_1(2x))/sqrt(1 - x²) dx

So now the problem is transformed into computing (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x)] / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Wait, no, the x is already there. Wait, the integrand is (x I_1(2x))/sqrt(1 - x²). So, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x)] / sqrt(1 - x²) dx.

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe there's another substitution or another integration technique. Let me think. The integrand now is x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²). Maybe a substitution like t = sqrt(1 - x²), but let's see. Let me try substitution. Let t = x. Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe x = sin θ. Let's try that. Let x = sin θ, so that dx = cos θ dθ, and sqrt(1 - x²) = cos θ. Then when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. Then the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫0^{π/2} [sin θ I_1(2 sin θ) / cos θ] * cos θ dθ = (1/2) ∫0^{π/2} sin θ I_1(2 sin θ) dθ

So that simplifies to (1/2) ∫0^{π/2} sin θ I_1(2 sin θ) dθ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe there's a series expansion for I_1(2 sin θ) that can be integrated term by term.

Recall that the modified Bessel function I_ν(z) has a series expansion:

I_ν(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k + ν} / [k! Γ(k + ν + 1)]

For ν=1, that becomes:

I_1(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k + 1} / [k! (k + 1)!]

So, substituting z=2 sin θ, we have:

I_1(2 sin θ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (2 sin θ)/2 )^{2k + 1} / [k! (k + 1)! ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (sin θ)^{2k + 1} / [k! (k + 1)! ]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫0^{π/2} sin θ * Σ_{k=0}^∞ (sin θ)^{2k + 1} / [k! (k + 1)! ] dθ

= (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (k! (k + 1)! )] ∫0^{π/2} (sin θ)^{2k + 2} dθ

Because sin θ * (sin θ)^{2k + 1} = (sin θ)^{2k + 2}

So, the integral is a sum over k of terms involving the integral of (sin θ)^{2k + 2} from 0 to π/2. The integral of sin^n θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is known as the Wallis integral, which is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n + 1)/2) / Γ((n + 2)/2). Alternatively, for even exponents, when n is even, n=2m, the integral is (π/2) (2m)!)/(2^{2m} (m!)^2) * (1/2). Wait, let me recall the exact formula.

The integral ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2m} θ dθ = (π/2) ( (2m)! ) / (2^{2m} (m!)^2 )

But in our case, the exponent is 2k + 2, which is 2(k + 1). Let m = k + 1. Then the integral becomes:

∫0^{π/2} sin^{2(k + 1)} θ dθ = (π/2) ( (2(k + 1))! ) / (2^{2(k + 1)} ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

Therefore, substituting back into the sum:

(1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (k! (k + 1)! )] * (π/2) ( (2k + 2)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

Simplify this expression. Let's write it step by step.

First, factor out constants:

(1/2) * (π/2) = π/4

Then, the remaining terms inside the sum:

[1 / (k! (k + 1)! )] * ( (2k + 2)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2k + 2)! 

Denominator: k! (k + 1)! * 2^{2k + 2} * (k + 1)!^2 = k! (k + 1)!^3 * 2^{2k + 2}

Wait, let's write it as:

(2k + 2)! / [k! (k + 1)!^3 * 2^{2k + 2}]

But perhaps we can simplify (2k + 2)! as (2(k + 1))! = (2m)! where m = k + 1. Then, using the identity (2m)! = 2^{2m} m! (m - 1/2)! sqrt(π) ? Wait, no, perhaps using the double factorial or another relation. Alternatively, express (2m)! = 2^{2m} m! (1/2)_m, where (1/2)_m is the Pochhammer symbol. Alternatively, recall that (2m)! = (2^m m!) * product_{i=1}^m (2i - 1)). Hmm, maybe not helpful here.

Alternatively, note that (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

But maybe it's better to express the ratio (2k + 2)! / (k! (k + 1)!^3) in terms of binomial coefficients or something else. Let's see:

Let me write m = k + 1. Then, when k = 0, m =1, etc. So:

(2m)! / [ (m - 1)! m!^3 * 2^{2m} ] 

But not sure. Let's try to compute the term for a general k.

Let me compute the term inside the sum:

Term = (2k + 2)! / [k! (k + 1)!^3 * 2^{2k + 2} ]

Let me factor out 2^{2k + 2} as 2^{2(k + 1)}. Then, (2k + 2)! = 2^{2(k + 1)} (k + 1)! (1/2)_{k + 1} }, but I might be mixing up some identities here. Alternatively, use the duplication formula for Gamma functions. The Gamma function duplication formula is Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). But I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's write (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

But perhaps we can write (2k + 2)! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!!, where (2k + 1)!! is the double factorial. But then (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...5.3.1. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's consider the term:

(2k + 2)! / (k! (k + 1)!^3 )

Let me write (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

But (2k + 2) = 2(k + 1), so:

= 2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

Then, the denominator is k! (k + 1)!^3 = k! (k + 1)^3 (k!)^3 )? Wait, no. Wait, (k + 1)! = (k + 1)k!, so (k + 1)!^3 = (k + 1)^3 (k!)^3. Therefore, denominator is k! * (k + 1)^3 (k!)^3 ) = (k!)^4 (k + 1)^3. 

So numerator is 2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

So term becomes:

[2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ] / [ (k!)^4 (k + 1)^3 * 2^{2k + 2} ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

Denominator: (k!)^4 (k + 1)^3 * 2^{2k + 2} ) = (k!)^4 (k + 1)^3 * 4 * 2^{2k} )

So term = [2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ] / [4 * 2^{2k} (k!)^4 (k + 1)^3 ) ]

Simplify constants: 2 / 4 = 1/2

Then:

= [ (2k + 1)(2k)! ] / [ 2^{2k} (k!)^4 (k + 1)^2 ) ]

Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's see if the series can be expressed in terms of known functions or if there's a generating function that matches this series.

Alternatively, perhaps switching the order of integration and summation is not the best approach here. Maybe there's another substitution or identity involving Bessel functions that can be used.

Wait, let's recall that I_0(2x) and I_1(2x) are related. Also, perhaps integrating x arccos x I_0(2x) can be related to some known integral transforms or special functions.

Alternatively, maybe using the integral representation of the Bessel function. The modified Bessel function I_0(z) has an integral representation:

I_0(z) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{z cos θ} dθ

But in our case, the integrand is x arccos x I_0(2x). If I substitute the integral representation of I_0(2x), then we might have a double integral. Let's try that.

So, I_0(2x) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2x cos φ} dφ

Therefore, the original integral becomes:

∫0^1 x arccos x [ (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2x cos φ} dφ ] dx

= (1/π) ∫0^π ∫0^1 x arccos x e^{2x cos φ} dx dφ

Interchange the order of integration:

= (1/π) ∫0^1 x arccos x [ ∫0^π e^{2x cos φ} dφ ] dx

But wait, the inner integral ∫0^π e^{2x cos φ} dφ is actually related to the modified Bessel function. Specifically, I_0(2x) = (1/π) ∫0^π e^{2x cos φ} dφ. So this substitution just brings us back to the original integral. That might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts again. The current integral after the first integration by parts is (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx. Let me consider integrating this expression. Maybe another substitution. Let me set t = sqrt(1 - x²), so that x = sqrt(1 - t²), dx = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Wait, but when x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. So the limits would invert, and the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫1^0 [ sqrt(1 - t²) I_1(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) / t ] * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt

Simplify:

The negative sign inverts the limits back to 0 to 1, and the integrand becomes:

sqrt(1 - t²) I_1(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) / t * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = -I_1(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt

Wait, but the negative from dx and the negative from inverting limits cancel, so overall:

(1/2) ∫0^1 I_1(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt

Hmm, that's simpler. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫0^1 I_1(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Let me make a substitution here. Let u = sqrt(1 - t²). Then, t = sqrt(1 - u²), dt = (-u)/sqrt(1 - u²) du. Wait, but when t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. So again, limits invert and we have:

(1/2) ∫1^0 I_1(2u) * (-u)/sqrt(1 - u²) du = (1/2) ∫0^1 I_1(2u) * u / sqrt(1 - u²) du

But this is the same as the integral we had before. So substitution didn't help. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe expanding I_1(2x) into its power series and integrating term by term. Let's try that.

The modified Bessel function I_1(z) has the series expansion:

I_1(z) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2m + 1} / [m! (m + 1)! ]

So, I_1(2x) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ ( (2x)/2 )^{2m + 1} / [m! (m + 1)! ] = Σ_{m=0}^∞ x^{2m + 1} / [m! (m + 1)! ]

Therefore, the integral (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx becomes:

(1/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [1 / (m! (m + 1)! )] ∫0^1 x^{2m + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Let me compute the integral ∫0^1 x^{2m + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let's make substitution t = x². Then dt = 2x dx, but maybe a better substitution is x = sin θ. Let x = sin θ, dx = cos θ dθ, sqrt(1 - x²) = cos θ. Then the integral becomes:

∫0^{π/2} (sin θ)^{2m + 2} / cos θ * cos θ dθ = ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2m + 2} θ dθ

Which is the same Wallis integral as before. So:

∫0^{π/2} sin^{2m + 2} θ dθ = (π/2) [ (2m + 2)! ] / [2^{2m + 2} ( (m + 1)! )^2 ]

Therefore, substituting back into the sum:

(1/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [1 / (m! (m + 1)! )] * (π/2) [ (2m + 2)! ] / [2^{2m + 2} ( (m + 1)! )^2 ]

Simplify this expression:

First, constants: (1/2) * (π/2) = π/4

Inside the sum:

[ (2m + 2)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)! * 2^{2m + 2} ( (m + 1)! )^2 ]

= [ (2m + 2)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

This is similar to the term we had before. Let me see if this can be simplified. Let's write (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! 

But again, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to relate this to a hypergeometric function. The sum resembles a hypergeometric series. Let's recall that hypergeometric functions are represented as Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (a)_k (b)_k ) / ( (c)_k k! ) z^k. Let's see if we can express our sum in terms of a hypergeometric function.

Let me write the term inside the sum as:

Term = (2m + 2)! / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Let me try to express this in terms of factorials. Let's note that (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! 

But (2m)! = (2^m m! )^2 (1/2)_m / π^{-1/2} }? Not sure. Alternatively, using the duplication formula again.

Alternatively, let's consider the ratio (2m + 2)! / (m! (m + 1)!^3 )

Let me write (2m + 2)! = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! 

Then, (m + 1)! = (m + 1) m!

So, (m + 1)!^3 = (m + 1)^3 (m! )^3 

Therefore, the term becomes:

[ (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)^3 (m! )^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

= [ (2m + 2)(2m + 1) (2m)! ] / [ m!^4 (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

But (2m)! / m!^2 = binomial(2m, m) * m! 

Wait, binomial(2m, m) = (2m)! / (m! )^2. So, (2m)! = binomial(2m, m) m!^2. Therefore, substituting:

= [ (2m + 2)(2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) m!^2 ] / [ m!^4 (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Simplify m!^2 / m!^4 = 1 / m!^2

So:

= [ (2m + 2)(2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [ m!^2 (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Hmm, binomial(2m, m) = (2m)! / (m! )^2, which we already used. This seems to be going in circles. Maybe there's a generating function for this series.

Alternatively, let's consider the term:

Term = (2m + 2)! / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Let me make a substitution k = m + 1. Then m = k - 1. So:

Term = (2k)! / [ (k - 1)! k!^3 2^{2k} ]

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps writing everything in terms of Gamma functions. Recall that n! = Γ(n + 1). So:

Term = Γ(2m + 3) / [ Γ(m + 1) Γ(m + 2)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Using properties of the Gamma function, Γ(2m + 3) = (2m + 2)(2m + 1)Γ(2m + 1), but not sure.

Alternatively, using the duplication formula:

Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z)

Let me set z = m + 3/2. Then:

Γ(m + 3/2)Γ(m + 2) = 2^{1 - 2(m + 3/2)} sqrt(π) Γ(2m + 3)

But this might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps expressing Γ(2m + 3) in terms of factorials. Γ(2m + 3) = (2m + 2)! 

But I'm not making progress here. Maybe this approach is not the way to go. Let's think differently.

Wait, going back to the original integral after the first integration by parts: (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx. Maybe there's a differential equation that this integral satisfies. Let me consider differentiating with respect to a parameter or something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the generating function for I_1(2x). The generating function for modified Bessel functions is e^{(z/2)(t + 1/t)} = Σ_{n=-∞}^∞ I_n(z) t^n. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider integrating x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²). Let me make substitution x = sin θ again. Then dx = cos θ dθ, sqrt(1 - x²) = cos θ. So the integral becomes:

∫0^{π/2} sin θ I_1(2 sin θ) dθ

Which is the same as before. Hmm. Maybe there's an identity involving integrals of Bessel functions over trigonometric functions. Alternatively, look up tables of integrals involving Bessel functions.

I recall that Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's tables might have some relevant integrals. Let me try to recall or imagine some entries.

For example, integral 6.552 in Gradshteyn-Ryzhik: ∫0^1 x (1 - x²)^{ν - 1/2} I_ν(a x) dx = 2^{ν - 1/2} sqrt(π) Γ(ν + 1/2) a^{-ν - 1/2} I_{ν + 1/2}(a)

But I need to check the exact form. Alternatively, if ν=0, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe integral 6.561. For example, 6.561.14: ∫0^a x^{μ - 1} (a^2 - x^2)^{β - 1} I_ν(c x) dx. But I need to check if any of these match our integral.

Alternatively, consider the integral ∫0^1 x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let me denote this integral as J. Let me make substitution t = x^2. Then x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Then:

J = ∫0^1 sqrt(t) I_1(2 sqrt(t)) / sqrt(1 - t) * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt = (1/2) ∫0^1 I_1(2 sqrt(t)) / sqrt(1 - t) dt

Let u = sqrt(t), so t = u^2, dt = 2u du. Then:

J = (1/2) ∫0^1 I_1(2u) / sqrt(1 - u^2) * 2u du = ∫0^1 [u I_1(2u) / sqrt(1 - u^2) ] du

Wait, that's the same as before. Not helpful.

Alternatively, consider expanding I_1(2x) into its power series and integrating term by term. Let's try that again.

I_1(2x) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (x)^{2m + 1} / [m! (m + 1)! ]

So, J = (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx = (1/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [1 / (m! (m + 1)! )] ∫0^1 x^{2m + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

As before, the integral is the Wallis integral, which is (π/2) ( (2m + 2)! ) / (2^{2m + 2} ( (m + 1)! )^2 )

Therefore, J = (1/2) * (π/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 2)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

= (π/4) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 2)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Let me write this as:

(π/4) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 2)(2m + 1)(2m)! ] / [ m! (m + 1)!^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

= (2m + 2)(2m + 1) / [ (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ] * (2m)! / (m!^4 )

But (2m)! / m!^2 = binomial(2m, m) m!^2 / m!^2 = binomial(2m, m). So:

= (π/4) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 2)(2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [ (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Hmm, binomial(2m, m) is central binomial coefficient. This series might be related to hypergeometric functions. Let's see.

Let me write the term as:

Term = (2m + 2)(2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) / [ (m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} ]

Simplify numerator:

(2m + 2)(2m + 1) = 2(m + 1)(2m + 1)

Denominator:

(m + 1)^3 2^{2m + 2} = 2^{2m + 2} (m + 1)^3

So term becomes:

2(m + 1)(2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) / [2^{2m + 2} (m + 1)^3 ] = (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) / [2^{2m + 1} (m + 1)^2 ]

So, J = (π/4) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [2^{2m + 1} (m + 1)^2 ]

= (π/8) Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [2^{2m} (m + 1)^2 ]

Hmm, binomial(2m, m) / 2^{2m} is equal to (2m)! / (m!^2 2^{2m}) which is (1/4^m) binomial(2m, m). But I know that binomial(2m, m) / 4^m is the central binomial coefficient scaled, which is also the term in the expansion of 1/sqrt(1 - x). But not sure.

Alternatively, note that binomial(2m, m) / 4^m = (1/2^{2m}) binomial(2m, m) = (1/2^{2m}) * (2m)! / (m! )^2. This term appears in the expansion of 1/sqrt(1 - x) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) (x/4)^m. But here we have an extra (2m + 1) and divided by (m + 1)^2.

Alternatively, consider generating function for the series Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [2^{2m} (m + 1)^2 ] x^m. If we can find a closed-form for this generating function, we can evaluate the sum.

Let me denote the sum as S = Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) ] / [2^{2m} (m + 1)^2 ]

Let me make substitution k = m + 1. Then m = k - 1. When m=0, k=1. So:

S = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ (2(k - 1) + 1) binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) ] / [2^{2(k - 1)} k^2 ]

= Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ (2k - 1) binomial(2k - 2, k - 1) ] / [2^{2k - 2} k^2 ]

= Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ (2k - 1) binomial(2k - 2, k - 1) ] / [4^{k - 1} k^2 ]

= 4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ (2k - 1) binomial(2k - 2, k - 1) ] / [4^k k^2 ]

But binomial(2k - 2, k - 1) = (2k - 2)! / [ (k - 1)! (k - 1)! ] = central binomial coefficient for 2k - 2.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a generating function identity here. Alternatively, consider that binomial(2m, m) / 4^m = (1/2^{2m}) binomial(2m, m) is the m-th term in the expansion of 1/sqrt(1 - x). So, 1/sqrt(1 - x) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) (x/4)^m.

But our sum involves (2m + 1) binomial(2m, m) / 4^m divided by (m + 1)^2. Let me write this as:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (2m + 1) / (m + 1)^2 ] [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ]

Let me write (2m + 1)/(m + 1)^2 = 2/(m + 1) - 1/(m + 1)^2. So:

S = Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ 2/(m + 1) - 1/(m + 1)^2 ] [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ]

= 2 Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ] / (m + 1) - Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ] / (m + 1)^2

Let me shift the index in each sum. For the first sum, let k = m + 1:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ] / (m + 1) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} ] / k

= 4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^k ] / k

Similarly, the second sum:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ binomial(2m, m) / 4^m ] / (m + 1)^2 = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} ] / k^2

= 4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^k ] / k^2

But binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} = binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 2^{2(k - 1)} = [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 2^{2(k - 1)} ] which is the term in the expansion of 1/sqrt(1 - x) at x=1.

But integrating the generating function might help. Let me recall that:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) (x/4)^m = 1/sqrt(1 - x)

Therefore, Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) x^m / 4^m = 1/sqrt(1 - x)

So, Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) x^m = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)

Wait, no. Wait, binomial(2m, m) x^m = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). So, if we set x = t/4, then Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) (t/4)^m = 1/sqrt(1 - t). Therefore, the generating function is 1/sqrt(1 - t).

Therefore, Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) t^m = 1/sqrt(1 - 4t). So, for our case, we have:

Σ_{m=0}^∞ binomial(2m, m) (x)^m = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)

Therefore, the generating function for binomial(2m, m) / 4^m is 1/sqrt(1 - x).

So, returning to our sums:

First sum: 4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^k ] / k = 4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} ] / (4k) ) = Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} ] / k

Let me denote n = k - 1. Then:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1)

Similarly, the second sum becomes:

4 Σ_{k=1}^∞ [ binomial(2(k - 1), k - 1) / 4^{k - 1} ] / k^2 = Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1)^2

So, S = 2 * Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1) - Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1)^2

Now, these sums are related to integrating the generating function. Let's consider the generating function G(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)

Then, integrating G(x) term by term:

∫0^x G(t) dt = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^{n + 1} / (n + 1) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ binomial(2(n - 1), n - 1) x^n / n

But we have Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) (1/4)^n / (n + 1) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ binomial(2(m - 1), m - 1) (1/4)^{m - 1} / m

Which is the same as ∫0^{1/4} G(t) dt / t. Wait, let's see:

Let me write Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n / (n + 1) = (1/x) Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^{n + 1} / (n + 1) = (1/x) ∫0^x G(t) dt

Because integrating G(t) from 0 to x gives Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^{n + 1} / (n + 1). Therefore:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n / (n + 1) = (1/x) ∫0^x G(t) dt = (1/x) ∫0^x 1/sqrt(1 - 4t) dt

Compute the integral:

∫0^x 1/sqrt(1 - 4t) dt = [ - (1/2) sqrt(1 - 4t) ] from 0 to x = - (1/2) sqrt(1 - 4x) + (1/2) sqrt(1) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/2

Therefore, Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n / (n + 1) = (1/x) * (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/2

For x = 1/4, this becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) (1/4)^n / (n + 1) = (1/(1/4)) * (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/4)))/2 = 4 * (1 - sqrt(0))/2 = 4 * (1 - 0)/2 = 2

So the first sum is 2.

Now, the second sum is Σ_{n=0}^∞ [ binomial(2n, n) / 4^n ] / (n + 1)^2. Let's denote this sum as T.

To compute T, we can consider integrating the previous result. Let me recall that:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n / (n + 1) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x)

Then, integrating this from 0 to x to get the sum involving 1/(n + 1)^2.

Let me denote S1(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) x^n / (n + 1) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x)

Then, integrating S1(x) from 0 to y:

∫0^y S1(x) dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) ∫0^y x^n / (n + 1) dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) y^{n + 1} / (n + 1)^2 = y Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) y^n / (n + 1)^2

Therefore, T = Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) (1/4)^n / (n + 1)^2 = (1/4)^{-1} ∫0^{1/4} S1(x) dx = 4 ∫0^{1/4} (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x) dx

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The expression is:

∫0^y S1(x) dx = y Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) y^n / (n + 1)^2

Therefore, Σ_{n=0}^∞ binomial(2n, n) y^n / (n + 1)^2 = (1/y) ∫0^y S1(x) dx

So for y = 1/4:

T = (1/(1/4)) ∫0^{1/4} S1(x) dx = 4 ∫0^{1/4} (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x) dx

Simplify the integral becomes:

4 * ∫0^{1/4} [1 - sqrt(1 - 4x)] / (2x) dx = 2 ∫0^{1/4} [1 - sqrt(1 - 4x)] / x dx

Let me make substitution u = sqrt(1 - 4x). Then, u^2 = 1 - 4x => x = (1 - u^2)/4, dx = (-2u)/4 du = -u/2 du

When x=0, u=1; x=1/4, u=0. So the integral becomes:

2 ∫1^0 [1 - u] / [(1 - u^2)/4] * (-u/2) du

Simplify:

2 * ∫0^1 [1 - u] / [(1 - u^2)/4] * (u/2) du

= 2 * 4/2 ∫0^1 [1 - u] u / (1 - u^2) du

= 4 ∫0^1 [u(1 - u)] / (1 - u^2) du

Simplify the integrand:

[ u(1 - u) ] / (1 - u^2) = u(1 - u) / [(1 - u)(1 + u)] = u / (1 + u)

Therefore, the integral becomes:

4 ∫0^1 u / (1 + u) du = 4 ∫0^1 [ (1 + u) - 1 ] / (1 + u) du = 4 ∫0^1 [1 - 1/(1 + u)] du

= 4 [ u - ln|1 + u| ] from 0 to 1

= 4 [ (1 - ln 2) - (0 - 0) ] = 4(1 - ln 2)

Therefore, T = 4(1 - ln 2)

So, going back to S:

S = 2 * 2 - 4(1 - ln 2) = 4 - 4 + 4 ln 2 = 4 ln 2

Therefore, J = (π/8) * S = (π/8) * 4 ln 2 = (π/2) ln 2

Wait, that's a clean result! So the integral J = (π/2) ln 2. Therefore, the original integral after the first integration by parts is (1/2) J = (1/2)(π/2 ln 2) = π/4 ln 2.

But wait, let me verify this. Because earlier steps involved multiple substitutions and series expansions, but the final result seems too clean. Let me check the steps:

1. Original integral became after integration by parts: (1/2) ∫0^1 [x I_1(2x) / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx = J/2.

2. Then, through series expansion and evaluating the sum S, we found that J = π/2 ln 2.

3. Therefore, the original integral is J/2 = π/4 ln 2.

But let me verify this numerically. Let's compute the integral numerically and see if it's approximately π/4 ln 2.

Compute π/4 ln 2:

π ≈ 3.1415926536

ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806

π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634

π/4 * ln 2 ≈ 0.7853981634 * 0.6931471806 ≈ 0.5449871041

Now, let's compute the original integral numerically using a calculator or approximate method.

The integral is ∫0^1 x arccos x I_0(2x) dx.

Using numerical integration methods like Gaussian quadrature or adaptive methods. Since I can't compute it here, but I can estimate it.

Alternatively, using approximate values for I_0(2x). The modified Bessel function I_0(z) can be approximated by its series expansion:

I_0(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k} / (k! )^2

For z=2x, I_0(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x)^{2k} / (k! )^2

So, the integrand is x arccos x Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k} / (k! )^2

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k + 1} arccos x / (k! )^2

Integrate term by term:

∫0^1 x^{2k + 1} arccos x dx

This integral can be computed using integration by parts. Let u = arccos x, dv = x^{2k + 1} dx. Then du = -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, v = x^{2k + 2}/(2k + 2)

So, the integral becomes:

uv|0^1 - ∫0^1 v du = [arccos(1) * 0 - arccos(0) * 0]/(2k + 2) + (1/(2k + 2)) ∫0^1 x^{2k + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

But arccos(1) = 0, and at x=0, arccos(0) = π/2, but multiplied by 0, so boundary terms are 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/(2k + 2)) ∫0^1 x^{2k + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Which is the same Wallis integral as before. So:

= (1/(2k + 2)) * (π/2) ( (2k + 2)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

= (π/ (4(k + 1))) * ( (2k + 2)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} ( (k + 1)! )^2 )

Simplify:

(2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! 

And (k + 1)! = (k + 1)k!

So:

= (π/ (4(k + 1))) * (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! / (2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 )

= (π/ (4(k + 1))) * (2(k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) / (2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 )

= (π/4) * (2k + 1)(2k)! / (2^{2k + 2} (k + 1) (k! )^2 )

= (π/4) * (2k + 1) / (2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)) * (2k)! / (k! )^2 

But (2k)! / (k! )^2 = binomial(2k, k)

So:

= (π/4) * (2k + 1) binomial(2k, k) / (2^{2k + 2} (k + 1))

= (π/4) * (2k + 1) binomial(2k, k) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1))

= (π/16) * (2k + 1) binomial(2k, k) / (4^k (k + 1))

But this seems complicated. However, when we sum over k, the original integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k! )^2 ] * (π/16) * (2k + 1) binomial(2k, k) / (4^k (k + 1))

But this seems like a dead end. However, we already derived earlier that the integral equals π/4 ln 2 ≈ 0.5449871041.

Let me check this value numerically. Using a calculator or approximate integration.

Alternatively, using Wolfram Alpha, but since I can't access it, I'll proceed with the analytical result.

Given that the series expansion led us to S = 4 ln 2, and hence J = π/2 ln 2, and the original integral is J/2 = π/4 ln 2, which is approximately 0.5449871041.

Therefore, the exact answer is π/4 ln 2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.5449871041.

So, the final answer should be:

{"answer": "\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\ln 2", "numerical_answer": "0.5449871041"}
