Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) times the square root of (2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it.

First, I need to look for a substitution that can handle the square root part. The expression under the square root is 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Let me see if this can be rewritten in a way that makes the integral more manageable. Sometimes, when there's a polynomial inside a square root and a polynomial multiplied by it, a substitution involving the inner function might work.

Let me consider letting u be the expression under the square root. So, u = 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Then, du/dx would be 8x^3 + 6x. Hmm, but the integrand has x^6 + x^4 + x^2. That doesn't directly match with du. Maybe I need to manipulate the integrand to see if it can be expressed in terms of u and du.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make the square root term simpler. Let me check the degree of the polynomial inside the square root. It's a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. The integrand is a product of a degree 6 polynomial and the square root of a quartic. That's quite high. Maybe there's a way to factor the quartic or express it as a square?

Wait, let me check if 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6 can be written as a perfect square. Suppose it's (ax^2 + bx + c)^2. Expanding that gives a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2. Comparing coefficients with 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6, we see that the x^3 and x terms are zero. So 2ab = 0 and 2bc = 0. If a ≠ 0, then b must be 0. Then, 2ac + b^2 = 3, and c^2 = 6. But c^2 = 6 implies c = sqrt(6) or -sqrt(6). Then 2a*c = 3. So a = 3/(2c) = 3/(2*sqrt(6)) or 3/(2*(-sqrt(6))). Then a^2 would be 9/(4*6) = 3/8, but we need a^2 = 2. 3/8 is not 2. So that doesn't work. Therefore, the quartic isn't a perfect square. So that approach is out.

Hmm, maybe another substitution. Let's see, the integrand is (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6). Let me factor out x^2 from the terms inside the square root. Wait, 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6 = x^2(2x^2 + 3) + 6. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor the polynomial inside the square root. Let me check if it factors. Let me set y = x^2. Then the expression becomes 2y^2 + 3y + 6. Let's check the discriminant: 9 - 48 = -39, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. So that approach is also not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution like t = x^2. Let me try that. Let t = x^2, so dt = 2x dx, which would mean dx = dt/(2sqrt(t)). Then, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of (t^3 + t^2 + t) * sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6) * (dt/(2sqrt(t))). Wait, that seems more complicated. Let me check:

Original integral: ∫ (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6) dx.

With t = x^2, x^6 = t^3, x^4 = t^2, x^2 = t. So the integrand becomes (t^3 + t^2 + t) * sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6) * (dt/(2sqrt(t))). Wait, but sqrt(2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6) becomes sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6)? Wait, no. Wait, 2x^4 is 2t^2, 3x^2 is 3t, so the sqrt becomes sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6). Wait, but the original constant term is 6, so 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6 = 2t^2 + 3t + 6? Wait, no, that's a typo. The original expression is 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. So substituting t = x^2, that becomes 2t^2 + 3t + 6. So sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6). Then, the integrand is (t^3 + t^2 + t) * sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6) * (1/(2sqrt(t))) dt. Simplify the terms:

(t^3 + t^2 + t) / sqrt(t) = t^(3 - 0.5) + t^(2 - 0.5) + t^(1 - 0.5) = t^(2.5) + t^1.5 + t^0.5. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (t^(5/2) + t^(3/2) + t^(1/2)) * sqrt(2t^2 + 3t + 6) dt from t=0 to t=1. Hmm, not sure if that's better. Maybe not. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a substitution where the expression under the square root and the other terms can be related. Let me look at the integrand again: (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6). Let me factor x^2 from the first part: x^2(x^4 + x^2 + 1). So the integrand is x^2(x^4 + x^2 + 1) * sqrt(2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6). Hmm, maybe if I set u = x^4 + x^2 + 1, but then du/dx = 4x^3 + 2x. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe set u = 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Then du/dx = 8x^3 + 6x. Hmm, the integrand has x^6 + x^4 + x^2. Let me see if there's a relation between u and the other terms.

Wait, let's compute the derivative: du = (8x^3 + 6x) dx. If I can express the integrand in terms of u and du. Let's see. The integrand is (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) * sqrt(u) dx. Let me see if x^6 + x^4 + x^2 can be related to u or du. Let's note that u = 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Let me try to express x^6 in terms of u. Hmm, x^6 is x^2 * x^4. But u has x^4 terms. Maybe not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a multiple of du that can be combined with the integrand. Let's see: du = (8x^3 + 6x) dx. The integrand has x^6 + x^4 + x^2. Let me see if x^6 + x^4 + x^2 can be written as a combination of u and x^2. Let's see:

u = 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Let's solve for x^4: x^4 = (u - 3x^2 - 6)/2. Then x^6 = x^2 * x^4 = x^2*(u - 3x^2 - 6)/2. So x^6 + x^4 + x^2 = [x^2*(u - 3x^2 - 6)/2] + (u - 3x^2 - 6)/2 + x^2. Hmm, this seems messy, but let's try:

First term: (x^2 u - 3x^4 -6x^2)/2

Second term: (u - 3x^2 -6)/2

Third term: x^2

Combine all terms:

= (x^2 u - 3x^4 -6x^2)/2 + (u - 3x^2 -6)/2 + x^2

Combine the fractions:

= [x^2 u - 3x^4 -6x^2 + u - 3x^2 -6 + 2x^2]/2

Simplify the numerator:

x^2 u -3x^4 -6x^2 + u -3x^2 -6 +2x^2

= x^2 u -3x^4 + (-6x^2 -3x^2 +2x^2) + u -6

= x^2 u -3x^4 -7x^2 + u -6

But x^4 can be replaced again using u: x^4 = (u -3x^2 -6)/2

So substitute:

= x^2 u -3*( (u -3x^2 -6)/2 ) -7x^2 + u -6

= x^2 u - (3u -9x^2 -18)/2 -7x^2 + u -6

Multiply through:

= x^2 u - (3u/2) + (9x^2/2) + 9 -7x^2 + u -6

Combine like terms:

x^2 u terms: x^2 u

u terms: -3u/2 + u = (-3u/2 + 2u/2) = -u/2

x^2 terms: (9x^2/2 -7x^2) = (9x^2/2 -14x^2/2) = (-5x^2/2)

Constants: 9 -6 = 3

So overall:

x^2 u - (u/2) - (5x^2)/2 + 3

Hmm, this seems to be getting more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the right way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution where the expression under the square root is a multiple of something squared. Let me check if 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6 can be expressed as a multiple of (x^2 + a)^2 + b. Let's try completing the square for the quartic. Wait, quartic terms complicate things. Let me consider 2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6. Let me set y = x^2, so it becomes 2y^2 + 3y + 6. Let's complete the square for this quadratic in y:

2y^2 + 3y +6 = 2(y^2 + (3/2)y) +6

= 2[ y^2 + (3/2)y + (9/16) ] - 2*(9/16) +6

= 2(y + 3/4)^2 - 9/8 +6

= 2(y + 3/4)^2 + 39/8

So 2x^4 +3x^2 +6 = 2(x^2 + 3/4)^2 + 39/8. Hmm, but this might not help much. The square root of that would be sqrt(2(x^2 + 3/4)^2 + 39/8). Not sure if that's helpful for substitution.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution like t = x^2 + 3/4. Then, dt/dx = 2x. But integrating with that might not simplify things. Alternatively, maybe hyperbolic substitution? But given the quartic, that might not be straightforward.

Wait, let's think differently. The integrand is (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let me see if there's a relationship between the polynomial outside the sqrt and the one inside. Let me compute the derivative of the inside function. Let’s let f(x) = 2x^4 +3x^2 +6. Then f’(x) = 8x^3 +6x. If I look at the integrand, it's (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) * sqrt(f(x)). Hmm, maybe if I can express x^6 +x^4 +x^2 in terms of f(x) and f’(x). Let's see:

Let me check if x^6 +x^4 +x^2 can be written as a combination of f(x) and f’(x). Let's see:

f(x) = 2x^4 +3x^2 +6

f’(x) =8x^3 +6x

So, perhaps x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = A*f(x) + B*x*f’(x) + C*x^2 + D. Let's try to find constants A, B, C, D such that:

x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = A*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + B*x*(8x^3 +6x) + C*x^2 + D

Expand the right-hand side:

A*2x^4 + A*3x^2 + A*6 + B*8x^4 + B*6x^2 + Cx^2 + D

Combine like terms:

(2A +8B)x^4 + (3A +6B +C)x^2 + (6A + D)

Set equal to left-hand side x^6 +x^4 +x^2. Wait, but the left-hand side has x^6 term, which is not present on the right-hand side. So this approach might not work. Therefore, maybe we need to include higher terms. Alternatively, perhaps x^6 can be expressed in terms of f(x) and x^2. Let's see:

From f(x) =2x^4 +3x^2 +6, we can solve for x^4:

x^4 = (f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2

Then x^6 =x^2 *x^4 =x^2*(f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2

So x^6 = (x^2 f(x) -3x^4 -6x^2)/2

But x^4 can again be replaced by (f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2:

x^6 = [x^2 f(x) -3*(f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2 -6x^2]/2

Let me compute that:

= [x^2 f(x) - (3f(x) -9x^2 -18)/2 -6x^2 ] /2

Multiply through:

= [ (2x^2 f(x) -3f(x) +9x^2 +18 -12x^2) /2 ] /2

Wait, let me do it step by step:

First term: x^2 f(x)

Second term: -3*(f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2 = -3f(x)/2 +9x^2/2 +9

Third term: -6x^2

Combine all terms:

x^2 f(x) -3f(x)/2 +9x^2/2 +9 -6x^2

= x^2 f(x) - (3/2)f(x) + (9x^2/2 -6x^2) +9

= x^2 f(x) - (3/2)f(x) - (3x^2/2) +9

Then divide by 2:

[ x^2 f(x) - (3/2)f(x) - (3x^2/2) +9 ] /2

= (x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) - (3x^2)/4 + 9/2

So x^6 = (x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) - (3x^2)/4 + 9/2

Therefore, the original integrand x^6 +x^4 +x^2 can be written as:

x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = [ (x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) - (3x^2)/4 + 9/2 ] +x^4 +x^2

But x^4 can be replaced again by (f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2:

= (x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) - (3x^2)/4 +9/2 + (f(x) -3x^2 -6)/2 +x^2

Let's expand this:

= (x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) - (3x^2)/4 +9/2 + f(x)/2 - (3x^2)/2 -3 +x^2

Combine like terms:

Terms with f(x):

(x^2 f(x))/2 - (3/4)f(x) + f(x)/2 = (x^2 f(x))/2 + (-3/4 +1/2)f(x) = (x^2 f(x))/2 - (1/4)f(x)

Terms with x^2:

- (3x^2)/4 - (3x^2)/2 +x^2 = (-3/4 -3/2 +1)x^2 = (-3/4 -6/4 +4/4)x^2 = (-5/4)x^2

Constants:

9/2 -3 = 9/2 -6/2 = 3/2

So overall:

x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = (x^2 f(x))/2 - (1/4)f(x) - (5/4)x^2 + 3/2

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe substituting back into the integral:

Integral becomes ∫ [ (x^2 f(x))/2 - (1/4)f(x) - (5/4)x^2 + 3/2 ] * sqrt(f(x)) dx

But f(x) =2x^4 +3x^2 +6, so sqrt(f(x)) is sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). So the integral is split into four terms:

(1/2) ∫x^2 f(x) sqrt(f(x)) dx - (1/4) ∫f(x) sqrt(f(x)) dx - (5/4) ∫x^2 sqrt(f(x)) dx + (3/2) ∫sqrt(f(x)) dx

But this seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let me think of another way.

Wait, perhaps there's a substitution where the integrand is proportional to the derivative of the function inside the square root. Let me check:

Let’s consider the substitution u = 2x^4 +3x^2 +6. Then du/dx =8x^3 +6x. The integrand is (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) sqrt(u) dx. If I can express x^6 +x^4 +x^2 in terms of u and du/dx. Let's see:

We have du = (8x^3 +6x) dx. Let me see if x^6 +x^4 +x^2 can be expressed as a combination of u and x*(du/dx). Let's compute x*(du/dx):

x*(8x^3 +6x) =8x^4 +6x^2. Hmm, 8x^4 +6x^2. Let me see:

We have u =2x^4 +3x^2 +6. So 4u =8x^4 +12x^2 +24. Then 4u - (8x^4 +6x^2) = (8x^4 +12x^2 +24) -8x^4 -6x^2 =6x^2 +24. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe express 8x^4 +6x^2 in terms of u:

From u =2x^4 +3x^2 +6, multiply both sides by 4: 4u =8x^4 +12x^2 +24. Then 8x^4 +6x^2 =4u -6x^2 -24. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let's see:

x^6 +x^4 +x^2 =x^2(x^4 +x^2 +1). Let me see if x^4 +x^2 +1 can be related to u. From u =2x^4 +3x^2 +6, maybe express x^4 in terms of u:

x^4 = (u -3x^2 -6)/2. Then x^4 +x^2 +1 = (u -3x^2 -6)/2 +x^2 +1 = (u -3x^2 -6 +2x^2 +2)/2 = (u -x^2 -4)/2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe this is a dead end. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps integration by parts. Let's consider integrating by parts, where we let one part be the sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) and the other part be the polynomial. But integration by parts usually requires choosing u and dv such that du and v are manageable. Let me try:

Let’s set v’ = sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) and u =x^6 +x^4 +x^2. Then du = (6x^5 +4x^3 +2x) dx, and v would be the integral of sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) dx, which seems even more complicated. So that might not help.

Alternatively, reverse the choice: let u = sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6), then du/dx = (1/(2*sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)))*(8x^3 +6x). Then dv = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) dx. But integrating dv would require integrating x^6 +x^4 +x^2, which is straightforward, but then v would be (x^7)/7 + (x^5)/5 + (x^3)/3. Then the integration by parts formula would be uv - ∫v du. But du has a term with 8x^3 +6x over sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6), which might not simplify things. Let me see:

Integration by parts gives:

uv|0^1 - ∫0^1 v du

But uv at 1 and 0 would be [sqrt(2+3+6) * (1/7 +1/5 +1/3)] - [sqrt(6) *0] = sqrt(11) * ( (15 +21 +35)/105 ) = sqrt(11)*(71/105). Then the integral becomes this minus the integral of v du. But the remaining integral would be ∫v * (8x^3 +6x)/(2 sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)) dx. This seems more complicated than the original integral. So integration by parts might not be helpful here.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me think if there's a substitution that can make the integral a standard form. Let's consider the expression under the square root: 2x^4 +3x^2 +6. If I factor out a 2, it becomes 2(x^4 + (3/2)x^2 +3). But not sure. Alternatively, maybe a substitution like t =x^2. Let me try that again. Let t =x^2, dt=2x dx, so x dx=dt/2. Then, the integral becomes:

Original integral: ∫0^1 (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) dx.

With t =x^2, x=0→0, x=1→1. Then x^6 =t^3, x^4 =t^2, x^2 =t. The integrand becomes (t^3 +t^2 +t) sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6) dx. But dx = dt/(2sqrt(t)). So the integral becomes:

∫0^1 (t^3 +t^2 +t) sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6) * (1/(2sqrt(t))) dt

Simplify the terms:

(t^3 +t^2 +t)/sqrt(t) = t^(3 -0.5) + t^(2 -0.5) + t^(1 -0.5) = t^(2.5) + t^1.5 + t^0.5

So the integral is (1/2) ∫0^1 (t^(5/2) + t^(3/2) + t^(1/2)) sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6) dt

Hmm, still complicated. Maybe another substitution here. Let me set u =2t^2 +3t +6. Then du/dt =4t +3. But the integrand has terms with t^(5/2), t^(3/2), t^(1/2). Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like u = sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6). Then du/dt = (1/(2sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6)))*(4t +3). But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe expand the sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6) into a power series and integrate term by term. But that would lead to an infinite series, which might not be helpful for an exact answer.

Wait, but the problem is asking for an exact analytical solution. So there must be a substitution that simplifies the integral. Let me think again. Maybe the integrand is a perfect derivative of some function involving sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let's suppose that the integrand is the derivative of some function multiplied by sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let's assume that the antiderivative is of the form (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let's differentiate this and see if we can match the integrand.

Let’s set F(x) = (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Then F’(x) = [5A x^4 +3B x^2 +C] * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x) * (1/(2 sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)))*(8x^3 +6x)

We want F’(x) to equal (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let's equate the two expressions:

[5A x^4 +3B x^2 +C] * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x) * (8x^3 +6x)/(2 sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)) = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) to eliminate the denominator:

[5A x^4 +3B x^2 +C]*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x)*(8x^3 +6x)/2 = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Let me compute each term:

First term: [5A x^4 +3B x^2 +C]*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Expand this:

5A x^4 *2x^4 =10A x^8

5A x^4 *3x^2 =15A x^6

5A x^4 *6 =30A x^4

3B x^2 *2x^4 =6B x^6

3B x^2 *3x^2 =9B x^4

3B x^2 *6 =18B x^2

C *2x^4 =2C x^4

C *3x^2 =3C x^2

C *6 =6C

So first term total:

10A x^8 + (15A +6B) x^6 + (30A +9B +2C) x^4 + (18B +3C) x^2 +6C

Second term: (A x^5 + B x^3 + C x)*(8x^3 +6x)/2

First, multiply out:

(A x^5 *8x^3 +A x^5 *6x +B x^3 *8x^3 +B x^3 *6x +C x *8x^3 +C x *6x)/2

= (8A x^8 +6A x^6 +8B x^6 +6B x^4 +8C x^4 +6C x^2)/2

Divide by 2:

4A x^8 +3A x^6 +4B x^6 +3B x^4 +4C x^4 +3C x^2

So second term total:

4A x^8 + (3A +4B) x^6 + (3B +4C) x^4 +3C x^2

Now, sum the first and second terms:

First term + second term:

10A x^8 +4A x^8 =14A x^8

(15A +6B) x^6 + (3A +4B) x^6 = (15A +6B +3A +4B) x^6 =18A +10B x^6

(30A +9B +2C) x^4 + (3B +4C) x^4 =30A +9B +2C +3B +4C =30A +12B +6C x^4

(18B +3C) x^2 +3C x^2 =18B +6C x^2

6C

So total sum:

14A x^8 + (18A +10B) x^6 + (30A +12B +6C) x^4 + (18B +6C) x^2 +6C

This must equal the right-hand side: (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Let's expand the right-hand side:

x^6*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) =2x^10 +3x^8 +6x^6

x^4*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) =2x^8 +3x^6 +6x^4

x^2*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) =2x^6 +3x^4 +6x^2

Sum all terms:

2x^10 +3x^8 +6x^6 +2x^8 +3x^6 +6x^4 +2x^6 +3x^4 +6x^2

Combine like terms:

x^10: 2x^10

x^8:3x^8 +2x^8=5x^8

x^6:6x^6 +3x^6 +2x^6=11x^6

x^4:6x^4 +3x^4=9x^4

x^2:6x^2

So right-hand side is 2x^10 +5x^8 +11x^6 +9x^4 +6x^2

Now, equate coefficients from the left-hand side (sum of first and second terms) and the right-hand side:

Left-hand side:

14A x^8 + (18A +10B) x^6 + (30A +12B +6C) x^4 + (18B +6C) x^2 +6C

Right-hand side:

2x^10 +5x^8 +11x^6 +9x^4 +6x^2

But notice that the left-hand side has no x^10 term, while the right-hand side has 2x^10. This suggests that our initial assumption of the antiderivative form is missing a term. Therefore, this approach might not work unless we include higher-degree terms in the assumed antiderivative.

Alternatively, maybe the antiderivative includes a term with x^5 multiplied by the sqrt function. But even then, the x^10 term would require a higher power. This suggests that this method might not be feasible, as the assumed form of the antiderivative is insufficient to produce the x^10 term on the right-hand side.

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a different substitution or method I'm missing. Let me think again about the original integrand: (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let me check if the polynomial outside the sqrt is related to the derivative of the polynomial inside the sqrt. The derivative of 2x^4 +3x^2 +6 is 8x^3 +6x. The polynomial outside is x^6 +x^4 +x^2. Let me see if x^6 +x^4 +x^2 can be expressed as a combination of x^3*(8x^3 +6x) and lower-degree terms. Let's see:

Let’s compute x^3*(8x^3 +6x) =8x^6 +6x^4. Compare to x^6 +x^4 +x^2. If we take (1/8)x^3*(8x^3 +6x) =x^6 + (6/8)x^4 =x^6 + (3/4)x^4. Then, x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = (1/8)x^3*(8x^3 +6x) + (1/4)x^4 +x^2. But this still leaves us with (1/4)x^4 +x^2. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps write x^6 +x^4 +x^2 = (x^2)(x^4 +x^2 +1). Let me see if x^4 +x^2 +1 can be expressed in terms of the derivative or the original function. Not obviously. 

Wait, another idea: Maybe the entire integrand can be expressed as the derivative of something involving the square root. Let me consider that the integrand is of the form f'(x) * sqrt(f(x)), which would integrate to (2/3)f(x)^(3/2). But in our case, the integrand is (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). If we can write this as f'(x) * sqrt(f(x)), then the integral would be straightforward. Let's check if (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) = f'(x) / sqrt(f(x)). Wait, but f(x) is 2x^4 +3x^2 +6. So f'(x) =8x^3 +6x. So (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) = (8x^3 +6x)/sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). But that would mean the integrand is (8x^3 +6x)/sqrt(f(x)) * sqrt(f(x)) =8x^3 +6x, which is not the case. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand can be expressed as a multiple of f'(x) times sqrt(f(x)) plus some other terms. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let's try to think of substitution u = x^2. Then, as before, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (t^(5/2) + t^(3/2) + t^(1/2)) sqrt(2t^2 +3t +6) dt from t=0 to t=1. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of a derivative. Let me set v =2t^2 +3t +6. Then dv/dt =4t +3. The integrand has terms like t^(5/2) sqrt(v). Maybe integrating by parts here. Let me try integrating the term t^(5/2) sqrt(v):

Let’s take the first term: t^(5/2) sqrt(v). Let’s set u1 = t^(5/2), dv1 = sqrt(v) dt. Then du1 = (5/2)t^(3/2) dt, and v1 = ∫sqrt(v) dt. But integrating sqrt(v) dt where v=2t^2 +3t +6 is not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. This seems to be going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can rationalize the square root. For quartic polynomials under a square root, sometimes substitutions like t = x^2 can reduce it to a quadratic, but we already tried that. Alternatively, maybe a trigonometric substitution, but I don't see an obvious one.

Wait, let's consider the substitution z = x^2. Then, as before, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (z^(5/2) + z^(3/2) + z^(1/2)) sqrt(2z^2 +3z +6) dz. Let me check if 2z^2 +3z +6 can be expressed as a quadratic in z, which it is. The square root of a quadratic might be handled by a standard substitution. For example, integrals involving sqrt(az^2 +bz +c) can sometimes be integrated using hyperbolic substitutions or other methods. Let me recall the standard integral forms.

The integral of z^n sqrt(az^2 +bz +c) dz can sometimes be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals, but since the problem asks for an exact analytical solution, perhaps there's a way to express it in elementary functions. However, given the complexity, I'm starting to think that maybe the integral is designed to have a substitution that simplifies it to something manageable.

Wait, let's go back to the original integrand: (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Let me try to factor the polynomial outside the sqrt. x^6 +x^4 +x^2 =x^2(x^4 +x^2 +1). The expression x^4 +x^2 +1 can be factored as (x^2 +x +1)(x^2 -x +1), but I'm not sure if that helps. Let me check:

x^4 +x^2 +1 =x^4 +2x^2 +1 -x^2 = (x^2 +1)^2 -x^2 = (x^2 +x +1)(x^2 -x +1). Yes, that's correct. So x^4 +x^2 +1 factors into (x^2 +x +1)(x^2 -x +1). But how does that help with the integral? Maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can combine the factors. Let me consider the expression under the square root:2x^4 +3x^2 +6. Let me see if this can be related to the factors of x^4 +x^2 +1. For example, 2x^4 +3x^2 +6 =2(x^4 +x^2 +1) +x^2 +4. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe not.

Wait, another idea: Let me check if the derivative of the expression under the square root is proportional to the polynomial outside. The derivative of 2x^4 +3x^2 +6 is 8x^3 +6x. The polynomial outside is x^6 +x^4 +x^2. If I factor x^2 from the polynomial outside, I get x^2(x^4 +x^2 +1). The derivative is 8x^3 +6x =2x(4x^2 +3). Not directly related, but maybe there's a connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand can be expressed as a combination of the derivative and the original function. Let me try:

Suppose we have:

(x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) = A*(8x^3 +6x)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + B*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)^(3/2)

Then, integrating this would be easier, as the first term is A times the derivative of the sqrt function, and the second term is B times the sqrt function to the 3/2 power. Let's see if this is possible.

Let’s expand the right-hand side:

A*(8x^3 +6x)sqrt(f(x)) + B*f(x)^(3/2)

We want this to equal (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(f(x)). Divide both sides by sqrt(f(x)):

A*(8x^3 +6x) + B*f(x) =x^6 +x^4 +x^2

Substitute f(x) =2x^4 +3x^2 +6:

A*(8x^3 +6x) + B*(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) =x^6 +x^4 +x^2

Expand:

8A x^3 +6A x +2B x^4 +3B x^2 +6B =x^6 +x^4 +x^2

Arrange terms by degree:

x^6: 0x^6

x^4:2B x^4

x^3:8A x^3

x^2:3B x^2

x:6A x

constants:6B

This must equal x^6 +x^4 +x^2. So equate coefficients:

x^6:0 =1 → Contradiction. So this approach doesn't work unless we include higher terms. Therefore, this method is not sufficient.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let me think again about the original integral:

∫0^1 (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) dx.

Let me try to make a substitution that combines both the polynomial outside and inside the square root. Let me set u =x^2. Then, as before, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫0^1 (u^{5/2} +u^{3/2} +u^{1/2}) sqrt(2u^2 +3u +6) du.

Let me consider the expression under the square root:2u^2 +3u +6. Let me complete the square for this quadratic in u:

2u^2 +3u +6 =2(u^2 + (3/2)u) +6 =2[(u + 3/4)^2 - (9/16)] +6 =2(u +3/4)^2 -9/8 +6 =2(u +3/4)^2 +39/8.

So sqrt(2u^2 +3u +6) =sqrt(2(u +3/4)^2 +39/8). This resembles the form sqrt(a^2 +t^2), which suggests a hyperbolic substitution. Let me try substituting t =u +3/4. Then, u =t -3/4, du =dt. The integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫_{u=0}^{u=1} ( (t -3/4)^{5/2} + (t -3/4)^{3/2} + (t -3/4)^{1/2} ) * sqrt(2t^2 +39/8) dt.

But this seems more complicated due to the shifted t terms. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like v = sqrt(2u^2 +3u +6). Then, v^2u^2 +3u +6. Differentiating both sides: 2v dv/du =4u +3. So dv/du = (4u +3)/(2v). But I don't see how this helps with the integrand.

Alternatively, perhaps express the integral in terms of v:

The integral is (1/2) ∫ (u^{5/2} +u^{3/2} +u^{1/2}) v du. If I can express u in terms of v, but this seems difficult.

At this point, I'm starting to think that maybe there's a clever substitution that I'm missing, or perhaps the integral is designed to be recognized as a derivative of a product involving the square root term. Let me try one more time to see if the integrand can be expressed as the derivative of some function involving the square root.

Suppose we consider d/dx [ (ax^5 +bx^3 +cx) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) ].

Wait, let's compute the derivative:

Let F(x) = (ax^5 +bx^3 +cx) * (2x^4 +3x^2 +6)^{1/2}

Then F’(x) = (5ax^4 +3bx^2 +c) * (2x^4 +3x^2 +6)^{1/2} + (ax^5 +bx^3 +cx) * (1/2)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)^{-1/2}*(8x^3 +6x)

We want F’(x) to equal (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)^{1/2}

Let me write this out:

(5ax^4 +3bx^2 +c) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (ax^5 +bx^3 +cx)*(8x^3 +6x)/(2 sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)) = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6):

(5ax^4 +3bx^2 +c)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (ax^5 +bx^3 +cx)(8x^3 +6x)/2 = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

This is the same equation as before when we tried this approach. As before, expanding and equating coefficients leads to a system of equations. Let's proceed to set up the equations.

From the previous expansion, we have:

Left-hand side:

14A x^8 + (18A +10B) x^6 + (30A +12B +6C) x^4 + (18B +6C) x^2 +6C

Right-hand side:

2x^10 +5x^8 +11x^6 +9x^4 +6x^2

But the left-hand side has no x^10 term, while the right-hand side has 2x^10. This suggests that our initial assumption of the form of F(x) is missing a term with x^5 or higher. Therefore, perhaps we need to include a higher-degree term in the assumed antiderivative. Let's try adding a term with x^7:

Let’s assume F(x) = (A x^7 + B x^5 + C x^3 + D x) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Then F’(x) = (7A x^6 +5B x^4 +3C x^2 +D) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (A x^7 + B x^5 + C x^3 + D x) * (8x^3 +6x)/(2 sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6))

Set this equal to (x^6 +x^4 +x^2) sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6). Multiply both sides by sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6):

(7A x^6 +5B x^4 +3C x^2 +D)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6) + (A x^7 + B x^5 + C x^3 + D x)(8x^3 +6x)/2 = (x^6 +x^4 +x^2)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Expand the left-hand side:

First term: (7A x^6 +5B x^4 +3C x^2 +D)(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Multiply term by term:

7A x^6 *2x^4 =14A x^10}

7A x^6 *3x^2 =21A x^8

7A x^6 *6 =42A x^6

5B x^4 *2x^4 =10B x^8

5B x^4 *3x^2 =15B x^6

5B x^4 *6 =30B x^4

3C x^2 *2x^4 =6C x^6

3C x^2 *3x^2 =9C x^4

3C x^2 *6 =18C x^2

D *2x^4 =2D x^4

D *3x^2 =3D x^2

D *6 =6D

So first term total:

14A x^10} + (21A +10B) x^8 + (42A +15B +6C) x^6 + (30B +9C +2D) x^4 + (18C +3D) x^2 +6D

Second term: (A x^7 + B x^5 + C x^3 + D x)(8x^3 +6x)/2

Expand:

[A x^7 *8x^3 +A x^7 *6x +B x^5 *8x^3 +B x^5 *6x +C x^3 *8x^3 +C x^3 *6x +D x *8x^3 +D x *6x]/2

= [8A x^{10} +6A x^8 +8B x^8 +6B x^6 +8C x^6 +6C x^4 +8D x^4 +6D x^2]/2

Divide by 2:

4A x^{10} +3A x^8 +4B x^8 +3B x^6 +4C x^6 +3C x^4 +4D x^4 +3D x^2

So second term total:

4A x^{10} + (3A +4B) x^8 + (3B +4C) x^6 + (3C +4D) x^4 +3D x^2

Now, sum first and second terms:

First term + second term:

x^{10}:14A +4A =18A

x^8:21A +10B +3A +4B =24A +14B

x^6:42A +15B +6C +3B +4C =42A +18B +10C

x^4:30B +9C +2D +3C +4D =30B +12C +6D

x^2:18C +3D +3D =18C +6D

Constants:6D

This must equal the right-hand side:2x^{10} +5x^8 +11x^6 +9x^4 +6x^2

Equate coefficients:

x^{10}:18A =2 → A=2/18=1/9

x^8:24A +14B =5. Substitute A=1/9:

24*(1/9) +14B =5 → 8/3 +14B =5 →14B=5 -8/3=7/3 → B=7/(3*14)=1/6

x^6:42A +18B +10C =11. Substitute A=1/9, B=1/6:

42*(1/9) +18*(1/6) +10C =11 → 14/3 +3 +10C =11 → 14/3 +9/3 +10C=11 →23/3 +10C=11 →10C=11 -23/3=10/3 →C=10/(3*10)=1/3

x^4:30B +12C +6D =9. Substitute B=1/6, C=1/3:

30*(1/6) +12*(1/3) +6D =9 →5 +4 +6D=9 →9 +6D=9 →6D=0 →D=0

x^2:18C +6D =6. Substitute C=1/3, D=0:

18*(1/3) +0=6 →6=6 ✓

Constants:6D=0. Which is true since D=0.

So we have A=1/9, B=1/6, C=1/3, D=0.

Therefore, the antiderivative is:

F(x) = ( (1/9)x^7 + (1/6)x^5 + (1/3)x^3 ) * sqrt(2x^4 +3x^2 +6)

Now, we can compute the definite integral from 0 to 1:

F(1) - F(0)

Compute F(1):

(1/9*1^7 +1/6*1^5 +1/3*1^3) * sqrt(2*1^4 +3*1^2 +6)

= (1/9 +1/6 +1/3) * sqrt(2 +3 +6)

Convert to common denominator (18):

= (2/18 +3/18 +6/18) * sqrt(11)

= (11/18) * sqrt(11)

F(0):

(0 +0 +0) * sqrt(0 +0 +6) =0

Therefore, the integral is 11/18 * sqrt(11)

Now, the exact answer is (11√11)/18.

For the numerical approximation, compute 11*sqrt(11)/18:

sqrt(11) ≈3.31662479036

11*3.31662479036 ≈36.482872694

36.482872694 /18 ≈2.0268262608

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 2.0268262608

So the final answer is {"answer": "\\dfrac{11\\sqrt{11}}{18}", "numerical_answer": 2.0268262608}
</think>

{"answer": "\\dfrac{11\\sqrt{11}}{18}", "numerical_answer": "2.0268262608"}
