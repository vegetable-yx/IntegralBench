Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of tan(cos(x)) from 0 to 2π. Let me start by recalling some integral properties and techniques. Hmm, the function inside the integral is tan(cos(x)). That seems a bit complicated. Let me think about whether there's any symmetry or substitution that can help here.

First, the limits of integration are from 0 to 2π. Trigonometric functions over a full period often have symmetry properties. Let me check if the integrand is an even or odd function, or if there's some periodicity that can be exploited.

The function tan(cos(x))... Well, cosine is an even function, so cos(-x) = cos(x). But tan is an odd function, so tan(-cos(x)) = -tan(cos(x)). However, since we're integrating over 0 to 2π, which is a full period, maybe there's a way to split the integral or use substitution.

Wait, another thought: Let's consider substitution. Let me try substituting x = 2π - t. Then, when x goes from 0 to 2π, t goes from 2π to 0. The differential dx becomes -dt. So the integral becomes the integral from 2π to 0 of tan(cos(2π - t)) (-dt), which is the same as the integral from 0 to 2π of tan(cos(2π - t)) dt. But cos(2π - t) is equal to cos(t), because cosine is periodic with period 2π and cos(2π - t) = cos(t). So the integrand becomes tan(cos(t)). Therefore, the integral is equal to the same integral from 0 to 2π of tan(cos(t)) dt. But that's the same as the original integral. So this substitution doesn't help us simplify it; it just shows that the integral is equal to itself. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another substitution. Let's consider splitting the integral into two parts: from 0 to π and from π to 2π. Let me see if there's a relationship between the integrand in these intervals. For example, substituting x = π + t in the second interval. Let's try that. Let x = π + t in the integral from π to 2π. Then when x = π, t = 0, and when x = 2π, t = π. The differential dx is dt. The integrand becomes tan(cos(π + t)). But cos(π + t) = -cos(t), so tan(cos(π + t)) = tan(-cos(t)) = -tan(cos(t)) because tan is odd. Therefore, the integral from π to 2π of tan(cos(x)) dx becomes the integral from 0 to π of -tan(cos(t)) dt. So if we add the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(x)) dx and the integral from π to 2π, which is the integral from 0 to π of -tan(cos(t)) dt, the total integral from 0 to 2π would be the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(x)) dx minus the same integral from 0 to π, which gives zero. Wait, does that mean the integral over the full period is zero?

Wait, let me verify that again. Let me split the integral I = ∫₀²π} tan(cos(x)) dx into I₁ = ∫₀^π tan(cos(x)) dx and I₂ = ∫π²π tan(cos(x)) dx. Then, substitute x = π + t in I₂. Then, as x goes from π to 2π, t goes from 0 to π. So I₂ becomes ∫₀^π tan(cos(π + t)) dt. But cos(π + t) = -cos(t), so tan(cos(π + t)) = tan(-cos(t)) = -tan(cos(t)) because tan is odd. Therefore, I₂ = ∫₀^π -tan(cos(t)) dt = -I₁. Therefore, the total integral I = I₁ + I₂ = I₁ - I₁ = 0. So the integral from 0 to 2π of tan(cos(x)) dx is zero. Is that correct?

But wait, is there a mistake here? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have an odd function over a symmetric interval. For example, integrating sin(x) from -a to a gives zero. But here, the function tan(cos(x))... Is the function tan(cos(x)) odd with respect to some point? The substitution suggests that over the interval [0, 2π], the integral cancels out because the function is symmetric in such a way that the positive and negative areas cancel. But is that actually the case?

Wait, let's test with a specific value. Let's take x = 0. Then cos(0) = 1, so tan(cos(0)) = tan(1). At x = π, cos(π) = -1, so tan(cos(π)) = tan(-1) = -tan(1). But when we integrate from 0 to π, the function isn't necessarily odd around π/2. Wait, but the substitution we did was shifting by π. So the function from π to 2π is a shifted and negated version of the function from 0 to π. Therefore, their integrals cancel each other. Therefore, the total integral is zero. That seems to be the case. So the exact answer is zero?

But wait, let me check with a numerical approximation. If the integral is zero, then numerically integrating tan(cos(x)) from 0 to 2π should give a value very close to zero. Let me try a quick numerical estimate. Let's approximate the integral by taking sample points. For example, using the midpoint rule with a few intervals. Let's take x = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π. Compute tan(cos(x)) at these points:

At x=0: cos(0)=1, tan(1) ≈ 1.5574

At x=π/2: cos(π/2)=0, tan(0)=0

At x=π: cos(π)=-1, tan(-1)= -tan(1)≈-1.5574

At x=3π/2: cos(3π/2)=0, tan(0)=0

At x=2π: cos(2π)=1, tan(1)≈1.5574

If we naively sum these values multiplied by the interval width (which is π/2 here), but this is a very rough approximation. However, notice that the values at 0 and π are 1.5574 and -1.5574, and at 2π again 1.5574. But since the integral is over 0 to 2π, the positive and negative areas might cancel out. But this is a very rough estimation. However, using symmetry, the integral from 0 to π cancels with the integral from π to 2π. Therefore, the exact answer is zero.

But wait, is there a case where the function is not odd over the interval? Let me think. The substitution shows that the integral from π to 2π is the negative of the integral from 0 to π. Therefore, adding them gives zero. Therefore, the exact value is zero. Therefore, the analytical answer is 0, and the approximation should be very close to zero.

But let me check with a better numerical method. Let's use a more accurate numerical integration method. For example, using the trapezoidal rule with more intervals. Let's compute the integral numerically. Alternatively, since I can't compute it here step by step, but I can recall that for odd periodic functions over their period, the integral is zero. However, tan(cos(x)) is not an odd function, but the integral over the full period might still be zero due to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the function tan(cos(x)) is an odd function with respect to x = π. Let's check: f(2π - x) = tan(cos(2π - x)) = tan(cos(x)) because cos(2π - x) = cos(x). Wait, that's not odd. If f(2π - x) = f(x), then it's even about x = π. But then integrating from 0 to 2π would be twice the integral from 0 to π. But earlier substitution suggested that the integral from π to 2π is the negative of the integral from 0 to π. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's re-examine the substitution. Let me set t = x - π. Then, x = t + π. When x = π, t = 0; when x = 2π, t = π. Then, dx = dt. The integral from π to 2π of tan(cos(x)) dx becomes the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(t + π)) dt. But cos(t + π) = -cos(t). So tan(cos(t + π)) = tan(-cos(t)) = -tan(cos(t)). Therefore, the integral from 0 to π of -tan(cos(t)) dt. Therefore, the integral from π to 2π is -∫₀^π tan(cos(t)) dt. Therefore, the total integral is ∫₀^π tan(cos(t)) dt + (-∫₀^π tan(cos(t)) dt) = 0. Therefore, the integral over 0 to 2π is zero. So the exact answer is zero.

Therefore, the analytical solution is 0, and the numerical approximation should be a very small number close to zero, possibly due to rounding errors. However, let me confirm this with a numerical method. For example, using a calculator or software. But since I can't do that here, I can reason that due to the symmetry, the integral cancels out exactly. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.
