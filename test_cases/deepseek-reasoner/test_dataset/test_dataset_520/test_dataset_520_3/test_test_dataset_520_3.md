Okay, so I need to calculate the definite integral of tan(cos(x)) from 0 to 2π. Let me start by thinking about how to approach this. Hmm, integrating tan(cos(x)) over a full period. First, I remember that integrating trigonometric functions over 0 to 2π can sometimes be simplified using symmetry or periodicity. Let me check if the integrand is an even or odd function, or if there's some symmetry here.

The function inside the integral is tan(cos(x)). Let's consider substitution. If I let t = x - π, shifting the interval, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe using properties of even and odd functions. Let's see, cos(x) is an even function, so cos(-x) = cos(x). Then tan(cos(-x)) = tan(cos(x)), so the integrand is even. But the interval here is from 0 to 2π, which is symmetric around π. Wait, but maybe splitting the integral into two parts from 0 to π and π to 2π.

Alternatively, consider substitution u = x - π. Then when x goes from 0 to 2π, u goes from -π to π. The integrand becomes tan(cos(u + π)). But cos(u + π) = -cos(u), so tan(cos(u + π)) = tan(-cos(u)) = -tan(cos(u)). So the integrand is an odd function with respect to u around 0, because if we shift by π, the function becomes odd. Therefore, integrating from -π to π of an odd function would give zero. Wait, does that mean the original integral is zero?

Wait, let me check that again. Let me make the substitution u = x - π. Then dx = du, and when x=0, u=-π; x=2π, u=π. The integral becomes ∫ from -π to π of tan(cos(u + π)) du. As cos(u + π) = -cos(u), so tan(cos(u + π)) = tan(-cos(u)) = -tan(cos(u)). Therefore, the integrand is -tan(cos(u)). So the integral becomes ∫_{-π}^{π} -tan(cos(u)) du. But since the integrand is -tan(cos(u)), and the interval is symmetric around 0. The function tan(cos(u)) is even because cos(u) is even, so tan(cos(-u)) = tan(cos(u)). Therefore, the integrand -tan(cos(u)) is an odd function? Wait, no. If we have f(u) = -tan(cos(u)), then f(-u) = -tan(cos(-u)) = -tan(cos(u)) = f(u). Wait, that's even. Because cos(-u) = cos(u), so f(-u) = -tan(cos(u)) = f(u). So the integrand is even. Therefore, the integral from -π to π of -tan(cos(u)) du is equal to -2 times the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(u)) du. But that doesn't immediately help. Wait, but the original integral is equal to this expression. So maybe this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the integral over 0 to 2π of tan(cos(x)) dx. Let me check if the integrand is periodic with period 2π, which it is, since cos(x) is 2π periodic, so tan(cos(x)) is also 2π periodic. So integrating over any interval of length 2π would give the same result. But how to compute this integral analytically? The integrand is tan(cos(x)), which is a complicated function. I don't recall a standard integral formula for tan(cos(x)). Maybe expanding tan(cos(x)) into a Fourier series or a power series?

Alternatively, maybe using substitution. Let me try substitution t = sin(x), but that might not help. Let's see, the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), but tan(cos(x)) is a function of cos(x), so perhaps substitution y = cos(x). Then dy = -sin(x) dx. But then, the integral becomes ∫_{x=0}^{x=2π} tan(cos(x)) dx. If I let y = cos(x), then when x goes from 0 to π, y goes from 1 to -1, and then from π to 2π, y goes back from -1 to 1. So the integral can be split into two parts: from 0 to π and from π to 2π. But integrating with substitution y = cos(x), we have dx = - dy / sin(x). But sin(x) is sqrt(1 - y^2), but with a sign depending on the interval. So maybe:

Integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(x)) dx = ∫_{1}^{-1} tan(y) * (-dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2) [since sin(x) is positive in [0, π]]

Similarly, integral from π to 2π of tan(cos(x)) dx = ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) * (-dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2) [but here, sin(x) is negative in [π, 2π], so sqrt(1 - y^2) would be multiplied by -1? Wait, let's be precise. When x is in [π, 2π], cos(x) = y, and sin(x) = -sqrt(1 - y^2). So dx = - dy / (-sqrt(1 - y^2)) = dy / sqrt(1 - y^2). So the integral from π to 2π would be ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) * (dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2). 

Therefore, combining both integrals:

Total integral = ∫_{1}^{-1} tan(y) * (-dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2) + ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) * (dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2)

But the first integral is from 1 to -1, so reversing the limits:

= ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) / sqrt(1 - y^2) dy + ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) / sqrt(1 - y^2) dy

Wait, but the first integral after substitution becomes:

Original first integral (0 to π): ∫_{1}^{-1} tan(y) * (-dy)/sqrt(1 - y^2) = ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) / sqrt(1 - y^2) dy

Second integral (π to 2π): ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) / sqrt(1 - y^2) dy

So total integral is 2 * ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y) / sqrt(1 - y^2) dy

But tan(y) is an odd function, and 1/sqrt(1 - y^2) is even. So the product is an odd function (odd * even = odd). Therefore, integrating an odd function from -1 to 1 would give zero. Therefore, the total integral is 2 * 0 = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the integral of tan(cos(x)) from 0 to 2π is zero? But let me verify this step again. Because if the integrand after substitution is an odd function, then integrating from -a to a would be zero. So here, after substitution, the integral becomes 2 * ∫_{-1}^{1} [tan(y)/sqrt(1 - y^2)] dy. But tan(y) is odd, 1/sqrt(1 - y^2) is even, so their product is odd. Therefore, the integral over symmetric limits (-1 to 1) of an odd function is zero. Therefore, the total integral is 2 * 0 = 0. So the exact answer is zero?

But wait, is that correct? Let me check with a numerical approximation. If the integral is zero, then numerically integrating tan(cos(x)) from 0 to 2π should give a very small number, close to zero. Let me try a simple numerical approximation. For example, using symmetry, maybe the positive and negative areas cancel out.

Alternatively, let's consider the function tan(cos(x)). Since cos(x) is symmetric around π, so cos(2π - x) = cos(x). Therefore, tan(cos(2π - x)) = tan(cos(x)). But when x is in [0, π], and x' = 2π - x in [π, 2π], then the function at x and x' are the same. But how does that affect the integral? Wait, but if we split the integral into [0, π] and [π, 2π], each part would be the same? But that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, no. Wait, if the function is symmetric around π, then the integral from 0 to π and from π to 2π would be equal. But according to substitution, they are equal but with opposite signs? Wait, no. Wait, in the substitution step, we found that the integral from 0 to 2π is equal to 2 * ∫_{-1}^{1} tan(y)/sqrt(1 - y^2) dy, which is zero. But if the function is even around π, then the integral over [0, 2π] would be twice the integral over [0, π]. But according to substitution, it's zero. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps my substitution step is wrong.

Wait, let me re-examine the substitution. Let me go back. Original integral: ∫₀²π tan(cos(x)) dx. Let me split it into ∫₀^π tan(cos(x)) dx + ∫π²π tan(cos(x)) dx. For the second integral, let me set u = 2π - x. Then when x = π, u = π; x = 2π, u = 0. Then dx = -du. The integral becomes ∫π²π tan(cos(x)) dx = ∫π^0 tan(cos(2π - u)) (-du) = ∫₀^π tan(cos(2π - u)) du. But cos(2π - u) = cos(u), so tan(cos(2π - u)) = tan(cos(u)). Therefore, the second integral is ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du. Therefore, the total integral is ∫₀^π tan(cos(x)) dx + ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(x)) dx. So according to this, the integral is twice the integral from 0 to π. But earlier substitution suggested it's zero. So there's a mistake in the previous substitution approach. Therefore, my previous conclusion that the integral is zero is incorrect. So where did I go wrong?

Let me check the substitution when I set u = x - π. Then x = u + π, dx = du. The integral becomes ∫_{-π}^{π} tan(cos(u + π)) du. Now, cos(u + π) = -cos(u). So tan(cos(u + π)) = tan(-cos(u)) = -tan(cos(u)). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{-π}^{π} -tan(cos(u)) du = -∫_{-π}^{π} tan(cos(u)) du. Now, tan(cos(u)) is an even function because cos(-u) = cos(u), so tan(cos(-u)) = tan(cos(u)). Therefore, the integral from -π to π of tan(cos(u)) du is 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du. Therefore, the original integral is -2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du. But earlier splitting the integral gave 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du. Therefore, this implies that -2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du, which would imply that 4 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 0, so ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 0, and hence the original integral is zero. But this contradicts the previous splitting approach. Wait, but according to substitution u = x - π, the integral becomes -2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du, but according to splitting into two integrals, it's 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du. Therefore, combining these two results, we have -2 I = 2 I, which implies that 4 I = 0, so I = 0. Therefore, the original integral is zero. So both methods lead to the conclusion that the integral is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is zero.

But why does splitting into two integrals give 2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du, but substitution gives -2 ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du? That seems contradictory unless ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 0. Therefore, the only way both can be true is if ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du = 0, which would make the original integral zero. But is ∫₀^π tan(cos(u)) du actually zero?

Wait, let's check numerically. Let me approximate ∫₀^π tan(cos(x)) dx numerically. Let's take a simple approximation, like using the midpoint rule with a few intervals. For example, take x = 0 to π, step size π/2. Midpoints at π/4 and 3π/4. Compute tan(cos(π/4)) and tan(cos(3π/4)). cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, tan(√2/2) ≈ tan(0.7071) ≈ 0.8541. cos(3π/4) = -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071, tan(-√2/2) ≈ -0.8541. The average of these two is (0.8541 - 0.8541)/2 = 0. Multiply by π (since the interval is π, and two intervals of π/2 each, but midpoint rule would be (π/2)*(f(π/4) + f(3π/4)) ) which is (π/2)*(0.8541 -0.8541) = 0. So even with this rough approximation, it's zero. But this is a very rough approximation. Let's try with more points. Let's take four intervals, each of π/4. Midpoints at π/8, 3π/8, 5π/8, 7π/8. Compute tan(cos(π/8)), tan(cos(3π/8)), tan(cos(5π/8)), tan(cos(7π/8)).

cos(π/8) ≈ 0.9239, tan(0.9239) ≈ 1.3764

cos(3π/8) ≈ 0.3827, tan(0.3827) ≈ 0.4040

cos(5π/8) ≈ -0.3827, tan(-0.3827) ≈ -0.4040

cos(7π/8) ≈ -0.9239, tan(-0.9239) ≈ -1.3764

Sum of these values: 1.3764 + 0.4040 -0.4040 -1.3764 = 0. Multiply by π/4 (step size) gives 0. So again, the approximation gives zero. Interesting. So maybe the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(x)) dx is indeed zero, which would make the original integral zero. But why is that?

Alternatively, perhaps the function tan(cos(x)) is an odd function about x = π/2. Let's check. For x and π - x. Let me take x and π - x. cos(π - x) = -cos(x). So tan(cos(π - x)) = tan(-cos(x)) = -tan(cos(x)). So if we consider the integral from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Let u = π - x in the integral from π/2 to π. Then, when x = π/2, u = π/2; x = π, u = 0. The integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^π tan(cos(x)) dx = ∫_{0}^{π/2} tan(cos(π - u)) (-du) = ∫_{0}^{π/2} tan(-cos(u)) du = -∫_{0}^{π/2} tan(cos(u)) du. Therefore, the integral from 0 to π is ∫₀^{π/2} tan(cos(u)) du + ∫_{π/2}^π tan(cos(x)) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} tan(cos(u)) du - ∫₀^{π/2} tan(cos(u)) du = 0. Therefore, the integral from 0 to π of tan(cos(x)) dx is zero. Therefore, the original integral from 0 to 2π is 2 * 0 = 0. So the exact value is zero.

Therefore, the analytical answer is 0. For the numerical approximation, integrating tan(cos(x)) over 0 to 2π would give a value very close to zero. Let me confirm with a numerical method. Using a calculator or software, but since I don't have access, I'll use a few more manual approximations. For example, using Simpson's rule with more intervals. Let's take n=4 intervals over 0 to 2π. But Simpson's rule requires even number of intervals. Let's take n=4, so step size h=(2π)/4=π/2. The points are 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π. The function values:

At x=0: tan(cos(0)) = tan(1) ≈ 1.5574

At x=π/2: tan(cos(π/2)) = tan(0) = 0

At x=π: tan(cos(π)) = tan(-1) ≈ -1.5574

At x=3π/2: tan(cos(3π/2)) = tan(0) = 0

At x=2π: tan(cos(2π)) = tan(1) ≈ 1.5574

Applying Simpson's rule: (h/3)[f(0) + 4f(π/2) + 2f(π) + 4f(3π/2) + f(2π)] = (π/2)/3 [1.5574 + 4*0 + 2*(-1.5574) + 4*0 + 1.5574] = (π/6)[1.5574 -3.1148 +1.5574] = (π/6)[0] = 0. So Simpson's rule with n=4 gives exactly zero. If I use more points, say n=6, but that's tedious. But given the symmetry, it's likely that the integral is exactly zero.

Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is also 0.0000000000.
