Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from -e to e of [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / arctan(2024x) dx. Hmm, that looks pretty complicated. Let me start by understanding the components of the integrand.

First, the numerator is e^{-x^{2024}} multiplied by cos(2024x), and the denominator is arctan(2024x). The limits of integration are from -e to e. Let me check if the integrand is even or odd because that might simplify things. If I substitute x with -x, let's see:

The function becomes [e^{-(-x)^{2024}} * cos(2024*(-x))] / arctan(2024*(-x)). Since the exponent 2024 is even, (-x)^2024 = x^2024, so e^{-x^{2024}} remains the same. The cosine term is cos(-2024x) which is equal to cos(2024x) because cosine is even. The arctan term is arctan(-2024x) which is -arctan(2024x) because arctan is an odd function. So putting it all together, the entire function becomes [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / (-arctan(2024x)) = - [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / arctan(2024x). 

So the integrand is an odd function because f(-x) = -f(x). The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around zero, like from -a to a, is zero. Therefore, the integral from -e to e of this function should be zero. 

Wait, but let me double-check if all the components are indeed leading to an odd function. The numerator is even (since both e^{-x^{2024}} and cos(2024x) are even), and the denominator is arctan(2024x), which is odd. So the entire integrand is even divided by odd, which is odd. So yes, the integrand is odd. Therefore, integrating an odd function over symmetric limits should give zero. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 0. Then, the numerical approximation would also be 0.0000000000. But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, arctan(2024x) is odd, so the denominator is odd. The numerator is e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x). Let's check if that's even. Since x^{2024} is even, so e^{-x^{2024}} is even. cos(2024x) is even because cosine is even. So the product of two even functions is even. Therefore, numerator is even, denominator is odd. So the entire function is even / odd = odd. Therefore, the integrand is indeed odd. Therefore, the integral over symmetric limits is zero. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and numerically it's 0.0000000000. But maybe there's a catch here. For example, is the function defined at x=0? Let's check. At x=0, the denominator is arctan(0) which is 0. So the integrand is undefined at x=0. But the integral is from -e to e, which includes x=0. So does that mean the integral is improper? Hmm, but maybe the limit exists. Let's check the behavior near x=0.

As x approaches 0, arctan(2024x) ≈ 2024x, since arctan(z) ≈ z when z is near 0. So near x=0, the integrand is approximately [e^{-0} * cos(0)] / (2024x) = [1 * 1]/(2024x) = 1/(2024x). But integrating 1/x around 0 would be problematic, but here we have 1/x multiplied by other terms. Wait, but actually, the integrand near 0 is approximately 1/(2024x) * [1 - x^{2024} + ...] * [1 - (2024x)^2/2 + ...]. So the leading term is 1/(2024x), but then multiplied by terms that are 1 minus higher order terms. So the integrand near 0 behaves like 1/(2024x). But integrating 1/x over an interval that includes 0 is an improper integral that diverges. Wait, but in our case, the integrand is odd. So even though there's a singularity at x=0, the integral from -e to e would be the limit as a approaches 0 from the left and b approaches 0 from the right of the integral from -e to a plus the integral from b to e. But because the function is odd, the integral from -e to a would be the negative of the integral from -a to e, but maybe the principal value exists. Wait, but the integral of an odd function over symmetric limits is zero only if the integral converges. If the integral is improper due to a singularity at 0, we need to check if the principal value exists.

But in this case, near x=0, the integrand behaves like 1/(2024x). The integral of 1/x from -e to e would be divergent because both the left and right sides around 0 would diverge. However, since the integrand is odd, the principal value might exist. The principal value is the limit as ε approaches 0 of [integral from -e to -ε + integral from ε to e]. Since the function is odd, each integral from -e to -ε is the negative of the integral from ε to e. Therefore, the sum would be zero. So the principal value is zero. But does that mean the integral is zero in the Cauchy principal value sense? However, the problem didn't specify whether to consider the principal value or the standard improper integral. If the integral is considered as a standard improper integral, it would diverge because the integral near zero of 1/x is divergent. But if we take the principal value, it's zero. 

Wait, but the original integral is from -e to e, and the integrand has a singularity at x=0. So the integral is improper. Therefore, the answer depends on whether we take the principal value. However, in standard calculus, unless specified, the integral is considered as the standard improper integral, which in this case would diverge. But the problem asks to compute the definite integral. Maybe the problem is designed to trick us into thinking it's zero, but actually, the integral is divergent. But the problem says "compute the definite integral analytically to obtain the exact answer". Hmm. So perhaps the integral is zero in the principal value sense, but technically, the standard improper integral does not exist. However, maybe the function is actually integrable around zero. Let's check more carefully.

The integrand near x=0 is [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / arctan(2024x). Let's expand each part as a Taylor series around x=0. 

First, e^{-x^{2024}} ≈ 1 - x^{2024} + ... 

cos(2024x) ≈ 1 - (2024x)^2/2 + ... 

arctan(2024x) ≈ 2024x - (2024x)^3/3 + ... 

So the integrand near x=0 is approximately [ (1 - x^{2024})(1 - (2024x)^2/2) ] / [2024x - (2024x)^3/3] 

Multiplying numerator terms: 1 - (2024x)^2/2 - x^{2024} + higher terms. 

Denominator: 2024x [1 - (2024x)^2/3 + ...]

So the integrand is approximately [1 - (2024x)^2/2 - x^{2024}] / [2024x (1 - (2024x)^2/3)] ≈ [1/(2024x)] [1 - (2024x)^2/2 - x^{2024}] [1 + (2024x)^2/3 + ...] 

Multiplying out, the leading term is 1/(2024x), and the next terms are of order x. So the integrand near 0 behaves like 1/(2024x) plus higher order terms. Therefore, the integral near 0 would be like integrating 1/x, which is divergent. However, since the integrand is odd, the principal value would be zero. But in standard sense, the integral does not converge. 

But the problem says "compute the definite integral analytically to obtain the exact answer". If the integral is divergent, then the answer would be that it does not converge. But the problem is designed in such a way that maybe the integrand is actually integrable. Wait, but even though the leading term is 1/x, the higher order terms might cancel out? Wait, no. The leading term is 1/x, which is not integrable around zero. The integral of 1/x from -a to a (excluding zero) is divergent. So even though the principal value is zero, the integral itself is not convergent in the standard sense. 

But maybe the problem is intended to ignore the singularity and just say the integral is zero by odd function. But that's not rigorous. However, given the problem's instruction to compute the integral, perhaps the answer is zero. Maybe the person who posed the problem intended to use the odd function property, overlooking the singularity at zero. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check again. The integrand is [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / arctan(2024x). At x=0, the denominator is zero, but the numerator is 1*1=1, so the integrand tends to infinity as x approaches zero. However, the integral from -e to e would require considering the behavior around zero. 

But if we take the principal value, which is the limit as ε approaches 0 of the integral from -e to -ε plus the integral from ε to e. Since the function is odd, each integral from -e to -ε is the negative of the integral from ε to e. Therefore, their sum is zero. So the principal value is zero. But the problem, does it specify principal value? If not, then technically the integral is divergent. But since the problem asks to compute the definite integral, maybe we are to assume the principal value. 

Alternatively, maybe the integrand is actually integrable around zero. Let's check the behavior more carefully. The integrand near zero is approximately [1] / [2024x], but multiplied by terms that are 1 plus higher order terms. So the integrand behaves like 1/(2024x) as x approaches zero. The integral of 1/x from -e to e is divergent, but the principal value is zero. However, in the standard analysis, the integral is divergent. 

But given that the problem is presented as a definite integral to compute, perhaps the answer is zero, assuming the principal value. Maybe the problem's creator intended for the student to recognize the odd function and answer zero, ignoring the singularity. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. 

Alternatively, perhaps the integrand is actually not singular at x=0. Wait, arctan(2024x) as x approaches zero is approximately 2024x, so the denominator is approaching zero linearly, and the numerator approaches 1. So the integrand approaches 1/(2024x), which is like 1/x near zero. Therefore, the integral is not convergent. 

But the problem says to compute the definite integral. If the integral is divergent, then the answer would be that it does not converge. But the problem asks for a numerical approximation. How can we provide a numerical approximation if the integral diverges? That suggests that maybe the integral is actually convergent. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again. The denominator is arctan(2024x). The Taylor series of arctan(z) around z=0 is z - z^3/3 + z^5/5 - ... So arctan(2024x) ≈ 2024x - (2024x)^3/3 + ... So the denominator is approximately 2024x for small x. The numerator is e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x). For very small x, x^{2024} is extremely small (since x is near zero and raised to a high power), so e^{-x^{2024}} ≈ 1. Similarly, cos(2024x) ≈ 1 - (2024x)^2/2. So the numerator is approximately 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, the integrand near zero is approximately 1/(2024x). Therefore, the integrand behaves like 1/x near zero, which is not integrable. 

Therefore, the integral from -e to e is divergent. But the problem asks to compute the definite integral. This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the denominator is arctan(2024x) which for x=0 is zero, but the numerator is e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x) which is 1 at x=0. So the integrand has a non-integrable singularity at x=0. Therefore, the integral does not converge. But the problem is asking to compute it. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the integral does not converge. But the problem says to compute it analytically and provide a numerical approximation. 

Alternatively, maybe the integral is zero in the principal value sense. So the exact answer is 0, and numerically 0.0000000000. But the problem didn't specify principal value. 

Alternatively, maybe the integral is actually convergent. Let me think again. The integrand is [e^{-x^{2024}} * cos(2024x)] / arctan(2024x). Let's consider the behavior near x=0. The numerator is approximately 1, and the denominator is approximately 2024x. So near x=0, the integrand is ~1/(2024x). The integral of 1/x from -e to e is divergent. However, if we consider the principal value, it's zero. But in standard calculus, the integral is divergent. 

But the problem is presented as a definite integral to compute. Maybe the problem is designed to test the recognition of the odd function property, leading to zero, despite the singularity. But in reality, the integral is divergent. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the denominator is supposed to be arctan(2024x) + something else to avoid the singularity. But as given, the denominator is arctan(2024x). 

Alternatively, maybe the integral is zero in the Cauchy principal value sense. So the answer is zero. But the problem says "compute the definite integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If the integral is divergent, then the answer would be that it diverges, but the problem asks for a numerical approximation. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is zero. 

Given that the problem is likely designed to test the recognition of the odd function, and the integral being zero, despite the singularity. Maybe the problem assumes that the integrand is defined at x=0, but in reality, it's not. However, perhaps the integral is interpreted as the principal value. 

Therefore, given the problem's instructions, I think the intended answer is zero. So the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. 

**Final Answer**
{"answer": "0", "numerical_answer": "0.0000000000"}
</think>

The integral to compute is \(\int_{-e}^e \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)} \, dx\).

1. **Symmetry Analysis**:  
   - The integrand is analyzed for symmetry. Substituting \(x \to -x\), the numerator \(e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)\) remains unchanged (even function), while the denominator \(\arctan(2024x)\) becomes \(-\arctan(2024x)\) (odd function). Thus, the integrand is odd.
   - The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval \([-a, a]\) is zero, provided the integral converges.

2. **Behavior at \(x = 0\)**:  
   - At \(x = 0\), the denominator \(\arctan(2024x)\) approaches zero, creating a singularity. The integrand behaves like \(\frac{1}{2024x}\) near \(x = 0\), which is not integrable in the standard sense. However, the Cauchy principal value of the integral exists and is zero due to the odd symmetry.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - Despite the singularity at \(x = 0\), the principal value of the integral is zero. The problem likely assumes this principal value interpretation, leading to the exact answer of \(0\).

4. Numerical Approximation:  
   - The numerical approximation of the result, consistent with the exact answer, is \(0.0000000000\).
