Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to √3 of (arctan(x) + arccot(x))/x dx. Hmm, first, I need to recall the properties of arctan and arccot functions. Wait, arccot(x) is the inverse cotangent, right? And I remember that arctan(x) + arccot(x) might have a known sum. Let me think. Oh yeah! For all real x, arctan(x) + arccot(x) equals π/2. Is that correct? Let me verify.

If I take x = 1, arctan(1) is π/4, and arccot(1) is also π/4, so their sum is π/2. Similarly, if x is any positive real number, arctan(x) + arccot(x) should be π/2 because they are complementary angles. So that simplifies the integrand a lot. Instead of dealing with both functions, I can replace their sum with π/2. That makes the integral much simpler.

So the integral becomes ∫₁^√3 (π/2)/x dx. That's just (π/2) times the integral of 1/x from 1 to √3. The integral of 1/x is ln|x|, so evaluating from 1 to √3 gives ln(√3) - ln(1). Since ln(1) is 0, it's just ln(√3). But ln(√3) can be written as (1/2) ln(3). Therefore, multiplying by π/2 gives (π/2)*(1/2) ln(3) = (π/4) ln(3). So the exact answer should be π ln(3)/4.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute π ≈ 3.1415926536, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122887. Multiplying these together: 3.1415926536 * 1.0986122887 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 1.0986122887. Let me calculate that. 3 * 1.0986 is about 3.2958, 0.14159 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.1555, so total approx 3.2958 + 0.1555 ≈ 3.4513. Then divide by 4: 3.4513 / 4 ≈ 0.8628. But let me do a more precise calculation. Let's use more decimal places.

π ≈ 3.141592653589793
ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098
Multiplying them: 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098. Let's compute this step by step.

First, 3 * 1.0986122886681098 = 3.2958368660043294
0.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.1555034057749805
Adding those gives 3.2958368660043294 + 0.1555034057749805 ≈ 3.45134027177931
Now divide by 4: 3.45134027177931 / 4 ≈ 0.8628350679448275

Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8628350679. Let me check with a calculator to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can compute π*ln(3)/4 directly. Let me use more precise values. π is approximately 3.141592653589793, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986122886681098. Multiplying gives 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098. Let's compute this:

3.141592653589793 * 1 = 3.141592653589793
3.141592653589793 * 0.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.3100627668020192 (since 3.14159 * 0.09 ≈ 0.282743, and 3.14159 * 0.008612 ≈ 0.02707, so total ≈ 0.282743 + 0.02707 ≈ 0.30981, but precise calculation would be better)
Adding 3.141592653589793 + 0.3100627668020192 ≈ 3.451655420391812. Then divide by 4: 3.451655420391812 /4 ≈ 0.862913855097953. Wait, this is slightly different from the previous calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me use a calculator for precise multiplication.

Alternatively, use a calculator: π * ln(3) ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098. Let me compute this using the formula (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator step.

Alternatively, note that 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 1.09861228866811. Let me compute this:

First, 3 * 1.09861228866811 = 3.29583686600483
0.141592653589793 * 1.09861228866811 ≈ 0.141592653589793 * 1 = 0.141592653589793
0.141592653589793 * 0.09861228866811 ≈ 0.0139654325
So total ≈ 0.141592653589793 + 0.0139654325 ≈ 0.155558086
Adding to the 3.29583686600483 gives 3.29583686600483 + 0.155558086 ≈ 3.451394952. Then divide by 4: 3.451394952 /4 ≈ 0.862848738. So approximately 0.862848738. But this is conflicting with previous estimates. Maybe I need to use a calculator for precise value.

Alternatively, use a calculator: π * ln(3) ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098. Let me compute this using a calculator:

3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098

Let me compute this step by step:

First, 3 * 1.0986122886681098 = 3.2958368660043294

Then, 0.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098:

Compute 0.1 * 1.0986122886681098 = 0.10986122886681098

0.04 * 1.0986122886681098 = 0.04394449154672439

0.001592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.001592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098

First, 0.001 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.0010986122886681098

0.000592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.000592653589793 * 1 ≈ 0.000592653589793, and 0.000592653589793 * 0.0986122886681098 ≈ approx 0.00005844

So total ≈ 0.000592653589793 + 0.00005844 ≈ 0.00065109

Adding to the 0.0010986122886681098 gives ≈ 0.0017497

So total for 0.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.10986122886681098 + 0.04394449154672439 + 0.0017497 ≈ 0.15555542141353537

Adding to the 3.2958368660043294 gives total π*ln(3) ≈ 3.2958368660043294 + 0.15555542141353537 ≈ 3.4513922874178647

Divide by 4: 3.4513922874178647 /4 ≈ 0.8628480718544662

So approximately 0.8628480718544662. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8628480719. Wait, but earlier I had 0.8628350679. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Wait, let's check again.

Wait, the exact answer is (π/4) * ln(3). Let me compute this using a calculator. Let me use a calculator to compute π/4 first. π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634. Then multiply by ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122887. So 0.7853981634 * 1.0986122887. Let's compute this:

0.7 * 1.0986122887 ≈ 0.7690286021

0.08 * 1.0986122887 ≈ 0.0878889831

0.0053981634 * 1.0986122887 ≈ approx 0.0053981634 * 1 = 0.0053981634, and 0.0053981634 * 0.0986122887 ≈ 0.000532. So total ≈ 0.0053981634 + 0.000532 ≈ 0.005930

Adding all parts: 0.7690286021 + 0.0878889831 + 0.005930 ≈ 0.8628475852. So approximately 0.8628475852. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8628475852. But when I did the previous step-by-step, I got 0.8628480719, which is slightly different. The exact value might be around 0.862848... So perhaps the correct numerical approximation is approximately 0.862848072 or similar. Let me check using a calculator.

Alternatively, use a calculator to compute (π * ln(3))/4:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793
ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098
Multiply them: 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 = ?

Using a calculator for precise multiplication:

3.141592653589793 × 1.0986122886681098

Let me compute this:

First, 3 × 1.0986122886681098 = 3.2958368660043294

0.141592653589793 × 1.0986122886681098:

Compute 0.1 × 1.0986122886681098 = 0.10986122886681098

0.04 × 1.0986122886681098 = 0.04394449154672439

0.001592653589793 × 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.001592653589793 × 1 = 0.001592653589793

0.001592653589793 × 0.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.000157079632679

So total for 0.001592653589793 × 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.001592653589793 + 0.000157079632679 ≈ 0.001749733222472

Adding the parts: 0.10986122886681098 + 0.04394449154672439 + 0.001749733222472 ≈ 0.15555545363500737

Now, total π × ln(3) ≈ 3.2958368660043294 + 0.15555545363500737 ≈ 3.4513923196393367

Divide by 4: 3.4513923196393367 / 4 ≈ 0.8628480799098342

So approximately 0.8628480799, which rounds to 0.8628480799 when rounded to 10 decimal places. So the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8628480799. Let me check with an online calculator to confirm.

Alternatively, using a calculator, π*ln(3)/4:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793
ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098
Multiply: 3.141592653589793 * 1.0986122886681098 = 3.451392319683774
Divide by 4: 3.451392319683774 / 4 = 0.8628480799209435

So the numerical value is approximately 0.8628480799 when rounded to 10 decimal places. Therefore, the exact answer is π ln(3)/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8628480799.
