Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is from 0 to 1 of x^{-0.5}(1 - x)^{−(−0.5 + 0.25)/2 −1} multiplied by (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{2*0.25} and ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the exponents first.

First, let me parse the exponents correctly. The term (1 - x) has an exponent of −(−0.5 + 0.25)/2 −1. Let's compute that. The inner part is -0.5 + 0.25, which is -0.25. Then, the negative of that is 0.25. Divided by 2 gives 0.125. Then subtract 1, so 0.125 - 1 = -0.875. So the exponent for (1 - x) is -0.875, which is the same as -7/8. Wait, 0.875 is 7/8, so negative is -7/8. Let me check that again: original exponent is −(−0.5 + 0.25)/2 −1. So inside the brackets: -0.5 + 0.25 = -0.25. Then negative of that is 0.25. Divided by 2 is 0.125. Then subtract 1: 0.125 -1 = -0.875. Yes, so exponent is -7/8. So (1 - x)^{-7/8}.

Then the term (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{2*0.25} is (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{0.5}, which is the square root of (1 + sqrt(1 - x)).

The logarithm term is ln(x / sqrt(1 - x))^1, so just ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)). Let me rewrite the integral for clarity:

Integral from 0 to 1 of x^{-1/2} (1 - x)^{-7/8} (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{1/2} ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)) dx.

Hmm, maybe substitution can help here. Let's see. The presence of sqrt(1 - x) suggests substituting t = sqrt(1 - x). Let me try that.

Let t = sqrt(1 - x). Then t^2 = 1 - x, so x = 1 - t^2. Then dx = -2t dt. When x = 0, t = 1. When x = 1, t = 0. So the limits will invert, and the negative sign will flip them back. So the integral becomes:

Integral from t=1 to t=0 of (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (t^2)^{-7/8} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) (-2t) dt.

Simplify the signs and limits: the integral becomes 2t times the integrand from 0 to 1. Let's write that:

2 ∫₀¹ t * (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (t^2)^{-7/8} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) dt.

Simplify the exponents. Let's handle each term:

First term: (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} is from x^{-1/2} where x = 1 - t^2.

Second term: (t^2)^{-7/8} = t^{-7/8 * 2}? Wait, no. Wait, (t^2)^{-7/8} is t^{-7/4}.

Third term: (1 + t)^{1/2}.

Multiply by t from the substitution: t * t^{-7/4} = t^{1 - 7/4} = t^{-3/4}.

So combining all terms:

2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) dt.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Let's see if we can simplify the logarithm term. ln((1 - t^2)/t) = ln(1 - t^2) - ln t. So we can split the integral into two parts:

2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} [ln(1 - t^2) - ln t] dt.

Which is 2 [∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln(1 - t^2) dt - ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln t dt].

Hmm, maybe this splitting can help. Let's look at each integral separately.

But before that, perhaps simplifying the (1 - t^2) terms. Note that (1 - t^2) = (1 - t)(1 + t). So (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} = (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{-1/2}. Then the (1 + t)^{1/2} term would multiply that, giving (1 + t)^{-1/2 + 1/2} = (1 + t)^0 = 1. So that simplifies!

So let's re-express (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} as (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{-1/2} * (1 + t)^{1/2} = (1 - t)^{-1/2}.

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} [ln(1 - t^2) - ln t] dt.

So that's 2 [∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t^2) dt - ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt].

Let me handle these two integrals separately. Let's denote them as I1 and I2:

I1 = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t^2) dt

I2 = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt

So the original integral is 2(I1 - I2).

Let's first compute I2, which might be a standard integral. The integral of t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} ln t dt is a known form. In general, ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} ln t dt = B(a+1, b+1) [ψ(a+1) - ψ(a + b + 2)], where B is the beta function and ψ is the digamma function. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the formula for the integral of t^{c-1} (1 - t)^{d-1} ln t dt is B(c, d) [ψ(c) - ψ(c + d)]. So in our case, for I2, the integrand is t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t. So c = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4, d = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Therefore, I2 = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(1/4 + 1/2)] = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4)].

Similarly, for I1, we have ln(1 - t^2). Let's see if we can express that in terms of t. Note that 1 - t^2 = (1 - t)(1 + t). So ln(1 - t^2) = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t). Therefore, I1 can be split into two integrals:

I1 = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t)] dt = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt + ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt.

Let's denote these as I1a and I1b.

I1a = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt

I1b = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt

For I1a, similar to I2, we can use the same formula. The integral ∫₀¹ t^{c -1} (1 - t)^{d -1} ln(1 - t) dt = B(c, d) [ψ(d) - ψ(c + d)]. So here, c = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4, d = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Therefore, I1a = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

So I1a = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)] )

Now, I1b is ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt. This seems trickier. Maybe we can expand ln(1 + t) as a series? Let's consider that.

We know that ln(1 + t) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} t^n / n for |t| < 1. But t is between 0 and 1, so convergence is okay except at t=1. But integrating near t=1, but since (1 - t)^{-1/2} is integrable. So perhaps we can interchange sum and integral.

So I1b = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} t^n / n dt = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n ∫₀¹ t^{n - 3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt.

The integral inside is the Beta function: B(n - 3/4 + 1, 1 - 1/2 + 1) = B(n + 1/4, 1/2). Wait, the integral ∫₀¹ t^{a} (1 - t)^{b} dt = B(a + 1, b + 1). So here, a = n - 3/4, b = -1/2. Wait, but (1 - t)^{-1/2} is (1 - t)^{b} where b = -1/2. So the Beta function is B(a + 1, b + 1) = B(n - 3/4 + 1, -1/2 + 1) = B(n + 1/4, 1/2).

But Beta function B(n + 1/4, 1/2) is Γ(n + 1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(n + 1/4 + 1/2) = Γ(n + 1/4)√π / Γ(n + 3/4).

Therefore, I1b = √π ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n * Γ(n + 1/4)/Γ(n + 3/4).

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps using differentiation under the integral sign. Let me consider a parameter in the integral. Let's set I1b = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt.

Alternatively, consider introducing a parameter s into the integrand such that differentiating with respect to s will bring down the ln(1 + t). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe express ln(1 + t) as an integral. For example, ln(1 + t) = ∫₀^1 t / (1 + ut) du. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let u = t. Then, maybe not. Alternatively, let me check if the integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or other special functions. But this might be getting too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps use integration by parts. Let me try that. Let u = ln(1 + t), dv = t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt. Then du = 1/(1 + t) dt, and v = ∫ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt. But integrating dv is not straightforward. The integral of t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt is the same as Beta function but with variable limits. So v = B(t; 1/4, 1/2), the incomplete Beta function, which might not help.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me try u = sqrt(t). Let u = t^{1/2}, so t = u^2, dt = 2u du. Then I1b becomes ∫₀¹ (u^2)^{-3/4} (1 - u^2)^{-1/2} ln(1 + u^2) * 2u du.

Simplify exponents: (u^2)^{-3/4} = u^{-3/2}, multiplied by u gives u^{-3/2 + 1} = u^{-1/2}. So:

2 ∫₀¹ u^{-1/2} (1 - u^2)^{-1/2} ln(1 + u^2) du.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me try u = 1 - t. Then when t = 0, u = 1; t =1, u=0. Then dt = -du. So I1b becomes ∫₁⁰ (1 - u)^{-3/4} u^{-1/2} ln(2 - u) (-du) = ∫₀¹ (1 - u)^{-3/4} u^{-1/2} ln(2 - u) du. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps numerical integration? But the problem says to compute it analytically. So maybe there's a trick I'm missing.

Wait, let's recall that the original integral had x^{-0.5} and (1 - x) to some exponent. This resembles the Beta function integral, which is ∫₀¹ x^{c -1} (1 - x)^{d -1} dx = B(c, d). But here, we have additional terms: the (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{0.5} and the logarithm term. Maybe the integral can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the Beta function with respect to parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution t = x/(sqrt(1 - x)). Wait, the logarithm term is ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)). Let me set u = x / sqrt(1 - x). Then, solving for x in terms of u. Let me try that.

Let u = x / sqrt(1 - x). Then, u^2 = x^2 / (1 - x). So u^2 (1 - x) = x^2. Then u^2 - u^2 x = x^2. Rearranged: x^2 + u^2 x - u^2 = 0. This is a quadratic in x: x^2 + u^2 x - u^2 = 0. Solving for x: x = [-u^2 ± sqrt(u^4 + 4u^2)] / 2. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe not the best substitution.

Alternatively, let me consider the substitution y = sqrt(1 - x). Then, similar to before, but we tried t = sqrt(1 - x) earlier. Maybe another substitution.

Wait, going back to the original integral before substitution. The original integral is:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/2} (1 - x)^{-7/8} (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{1/2} ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)) dx.

Let me try to express x in terms of another variable. Let me set t = sqrt(1 - x). Then, as before, x = 1 - t^2, dx = -2t dt, and the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} [ln((1 - t^2)/t)] dt.

Wait, we already did that. So maybe we need to proceed with the split into I1 and I2, and compute them using Beta and digamma functions.

So, let's first compute I2:

I2 = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4)].

Similarly, I1a = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

And I1b is the remaining term. So I1 = I1a + I1b.

But I1b is ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt. Let's see if we can relate this to some known function or use series expansion.

As before, expanding ln(1 + t) as a power series:

ln(1 + t) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} t^n / n.

Then, I1b = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n ∫₀¹ t^{n - 3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt.

The integral inside is B(n - 3/4 + 1, 1 - 1/2) = B(n + 1/4, 1/2).

So, I1b = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n * B(n + 1/4, 1/2).

But B(n + 1/4, 1/2) = Γ(n + 1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(n + 3/4).

We know that Γ(1/2) = √π. So,

I1b = √π ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n * Γ(n + 1/4)/Γ(n + 3/4).

Hmm, this series might be expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let's recall that Γ(n + a)/Γ(n + b) can be expressed using Pochhammer symbols. The ratio Γ(n + a)/Γ(a) = (a)_n, where (a)_n is the rising factorial. So Γ(n + 1/4)/Γ(1/4) = (1/4)_n, and Γ(n + 3/4)/Γ(3/4) = (3/4)_n. Therefore, Γ(n + 1/4)/Γ(n + 3/4) = Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n.

But (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n = (1/4)(5/4)...(1/4 + n -1) / (3/4)(7/4)...(3/4 + n -1) ) = product_{k=0}^{n-1} (1/4 + k) / (3/4 + k) = product_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 + 4k)/ (3 + 4k) ) / 4^{-n} ? Not sure. Alternatively, this ratio is the same as (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n = 1/( (3/4)_n / (1/4)_n ) = 1/( (3/4)(7/4)...( (4n -1)/4 ) / (1/4)(5/4)...( (4n -3)/4 ) ) = product_{k=0}^{n-1} (3 + 4k)/ (1 + 4k) ) / 4^{n} ?

Alternatively, perhaps express this ratio in terms of the beta function or hypergeometric series.

Alternatively, note that the sum becomes:

I1b = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n * (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n.

This resembles the definition of a hypergeometric function. The hypergeometric function _pF_q is defined as ∑_{n=0}^∞ (a1)_n ... (ap)_n / (b1)_n ... (bq)_n * z^n /n!.

But here, we have a sum over n starting from 1, with terms (-1)^{n+1}/n * (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n. Let's adjust indices to start from n=0. Let m = n -1. Then:

∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n * (1/4)_n / (3/4)_n = -∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/(m+1) * (1/4)_{m+1} / (3/4)_{m+1}.

But (1/4)_{m+1} = (1/4)(5/4)_m and (3/4)_{m+1} = (3/4)(7/4)_m. So:

-∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^{m+1}/(m+1) * (1/4)(5/4)_m / (3/4)(7/4)_m = (1/4)/(3/4) ∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^{m}/(m+1) * (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m.

Which is (1/3) ∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m / (m +1) * (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m.

But (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m = (5/4)(9/4)...( (4m +1)/4 ) / (7/4)(11/4)...( (4m +3)/4 ) ) = product_{k=0}^{m-1} (5 +4k)/ (7 +4k) ) / 4^{m} / 4^{m} ? Not sure. Alternatively, this can be written using the Pochhammer symbols as (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m = Γ(5/4 + m)/Γ(5/4) * Γ(7/4)/Γ(7/4 + m).

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, note that 1/(m +1) = ∫₀¹ t^m dt. So:

∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m / (m +1) * (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m = ∫₀¹ ∑_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m t^m (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m dt.

The sum inside is ∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m (-t)^m / 0! which is the hypergeometric function _1F_1(5/4; 7/4; -t) or maybe _2F_1 if it's a different type. Wait, hypergeometric functions: the general form for _pF_q is with p numerator parameters and q denominator parameters. Here, we have one numerator parameter (5/4) and one denominator parameter (7/4), so it's a _1F_1 hypergeometric function.

But _1F_1(5/4; 7/4; -t) = ∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m (-t)^m / m!.

But in our case, the sum is ∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m (-t)^m. So that's m! times the hypergeometric function. Therefore, the sum is ∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m (-t)^m = _1F_1(5/4; 7/4; -t) * m! ?

Wait, no. The standard hypergeometric series is ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m * z^m / m! = _1F_1(a; b; z). So if we have ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m z^m = _1F_1(a; b; z) * m! ? No, that's not correct. Let me check:

For example, _1F_1(a; b; z) = ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m * z^m / m!.

Therefore, ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m z^m = ∑_{m=0}^∞ m! * [ (a)_m / (b)_m * z^m / m! ] * 1/m! ? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If we have ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m z^m = ∑_{m=0}^∞ (a)_m / (b)_m z^m. This is not a standard hypergeometric function, but it can be related by factoring out m!.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as:

∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m / (7/4)_m (-t)^m = ∑_{m=0}^∞ (5/4)_m (-t)^m / (7/4)_m.

This is similar to the hypergeometric function _1F_1 but without the m! in the denominator. So it's not a standard hypergeometric function. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use integral representations of hypergeometric functions. But this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or identity that I'm missing.

Alternatively, let's consider that the original integral might be related to the derivative of some Beta function with respect to a parameter. For example, if we have an integral of the form ∫ t^{c} (1 - t)^{d} ln(1 + t) dt, perhaps we can differentiate a Beta function with respect to a parameter that's introduced.

Let me think. Suppose we consider the integral ∫₀¹ t^{c} (1 - t)^{d} (1 + t)^k dt. If we differentiate with respect to k, we get ∫₀¹ t^{c} (1 - t)^{d} (1 + t)^k ln(1 + t) dt. Then setting k=0 would give us the integral involving ln(1 + t). But in our case, k is not present. However, in our case, the exponent on (1 + t) is 1/2, but in the transformed integral I1b, we have (1 + t)^{1/2} already incorporated into the substitution. Wait, no, in the transformed integral after substitution, the (1 + t)^{1/2} term canceled out. Wait, no, in the original substitution, we had (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{0.5} which became (1 + t)^{0.5}, but then when we expressed (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} as (1 - t)^{-1/2}, so that term canceled. So in the current integral I1b, we don't have the (1 + t)^{1/2} term anymore. Wait, no, in the current I1b, which is part of the integral after substitution, the integrand is t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t). So the (1 + t) term is only inside the logarithm. So perhaps differentiating a Beta function with respect to a parameter.

Alternatively, consider introducing a parameter s into the integrand such that when we differentiate with respect to s, we get the ln(1 + t) term. For example, consider the integral ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^s dt. Then, differentiating with respect to s and evaluating at s=0 would give us I1b. Let's try that.

Let F(s) = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^s dt.

Then, dF/ds |_{s=0} = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt = I1b.

So if we can compute F(s) and then differentiate it, we can find I1b.

So first, compute F(s) = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^s dt.

This integral might be expressible in terms of the hypergeometric function. Recall that ∫₀¹ t^{c} (1 - t)^{d} (1 + t)^s dt can be expressed using the hypergeometric function _2F_1.

The integral ∫₀¹ t^{c} (1 - t)^{d} (1 + zt)^s dt is related to the hypergeometric function, but here we have (1 + t)^s. Let me check.

We can expand (1 + t)^s as a binomial series: (1 + t)^s = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k t^k / k! where (s)_k is the Pochhammer symbol. Then,

F(s) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k / k! ∫₀¹ t^{k - 3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt.

The integral is B(k - 3/4 + 1, 1 - 1/2 + 1) = B(k + 1/4, 1/2).

So,

F(s) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k / k! B(k + 1/4, 1/2).

Again, B(k + 1/4, 1/2) = Γ(k + 1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(k + 3/4).

So,

F(s) = Γ(1/2) ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k Γ(k + 1/4) / (k! Γ(k + 3/4)).

This can be written as √π ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k Γ(k + 1/4) / (k! Γ(k + 3/4)).

But Γ(k + 1/4)/Γ(k + 3/4) = [Γ(1/4) (1/4)_k ] / [Γ(3/4) (3/4)_k ] = Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * (1/4)_k / (3/4)_k.

Therefore,

F(s) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) ∑_{k=0}^∞ (s)_k (1/4)_k / (3/4)_k / k!.

This sum is the definition of the hypergeometric function _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1). Wait, the hypergeometric function _2F_1(a, b; c; z) is ∑_{k=0}^∞ (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k z^k / k!.

So here, we have ∑_{k=0}^∞ (1/4)_k (s)_k / (3/4)_k / k! * 1^k. Therefore, F(s) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1).

But the hypergeometric function _2F_1(a, b; c; 1) converges if Re(c - a - b) > 0. Here, a = 1/4, b = s, c = 3/4. So c - a - b = 3/4 - 1/4 - s = 1/2 - s. For convergence at z=1, we need Re(1/2 - s) > 0, i.e., Re(s) < 1/2. But we need to evaluate the derivative at s=0, which is within the convergence region.

Now, using Gauss's theorem, which _2F_1(a, b; c; 1) = Γ(c)Γ(c - a - b)/Γ(c - a)Γ(c - b), provided Re(c - a - b) > 0. Here, c = 3/4, a = 1/4, b = s. So c - a - b = 3/4 - 1/4 - s = 1/2 - s. So for s=0, this is 1/2 > 0, so it converges.

Therefore, _2F_1(1/4, 0; 3/4; 1) where s0=0 is Γ(3/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4 - 0)Γ(3/4 - 1/4) = Γ(3/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4)Γ(1/2) = 1. Wait, but s=0, so b=0. But the hypergeometric function _2F_1(a, 0; c; z) = 1 for any a, c, z, since all terms with k≥1 vanish. So when s=0, F(0) = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt = B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4). But according to the expression above, F(0) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * _2F_1(1/4, 0; 3/4; 1) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * 1. Which matches, since Γ(1/2) = √π, so B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4). So that's consistent.

But we need F(s) in general. However, we need to compute dF/ds at s=0. So let's write F(s) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1).

The derivative dF/ds at s=0 is √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * d/ds [_2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1)]_{s=0}.

The derivative of the hypergeometric function with respect to the parameter b (which is s here) is given by:

d/db [_2F_1(a, b; c; z)] = (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k * [ψ(b + k) - ψ(b)] z^k / k! summed over k from 0 to ∞. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, use the integral representation.

Alternatively, use the formula for the derivative of the hypergeometric function with respect to a parameter. For _2F_1(a, b; c; z), the derivative with respect to b is:

∑_{k=0}^∞ (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k [ψ(b + k) - ψ(b)] z^k / k!.

But evaluating this at b=0 might be complicated. Alternatively, since we are evaluating at s=0, and the hypergeometric function becomes _2F_1(1/4, 0; 3/4; 1) = 1, but the derivative would involve terms from the series expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps use the integral representation of the hypergeometric function and differentiate under the integral sign.

Recall that _2F_1(a, b; c; z) = Γ(c)/(Γ(b)Γ(c - b)) ∫₀¹ t^{b -1} (1 - t)^{c - b -1} (1 - zt)^{-a} dt for Re(c) > Re(b) >0.

But in our case, z=1, which is on the boundary of convergence. However, perhaps using this representation:

_2F_1(a, b; c; 1) = Γ(c)Γ(c - a - b)/(Γ(c - a)Γ(c - b)) when Re(c - a - b) >0.

But we need the derivative with respect to b. Let's denote this as F(b) = _2F_1(a, b; c; 1) = Γ(c)Γ(c - a - b)/(Γ(c - a)Γ(c - b)).

Then, dF/db = Γ(c) [ -Γ'(c - a - b)Γ(c - b) - Γ(c - a - b)Γ'(c - b) ] / [Γ(c - a)Γ(c - b)^2 ].

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, use the digamma function:

d/db ln F(b) = ψ(b) - ψ(c - b - a).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use logarithmic differentiation.

Given F(b) = Γ(c)Γ(c - a - b)/(Γ(c - a)Γ(c - b)),

ln F(b) = ln Γ(c) + ln Γ(c - a - b) - ln Γ(c - a) - ln Γ(c - b).

Then, d/db ln F(b) = -ψ(c - a - b) + ψ(c - b).

Therefore, dF/db = F(b) [ -ψ(c - a - b) + ψ(c - b) ].

So, for our case, a=1/4, b=s, c=3/4.

Thus, d/ds _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1) = _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1) [ -ψ(3/4 - 1/4 - s) + ψ(3/4 - s) ].

At s=0, this becomes [ -ψ(3/4 - 1/4) + ψ(3/4) ] * _2F_1(1/4, 0; 3/4; 1).

But _2F_1(1/4, 0; 3/4; 1) =1, and 3/4 -1/4 = 1/2. So,

d/ds _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1) |_{s=0} = [ -ψ(1/2) + ψ(3/4) ].

Therefore, the derivative dF/ds at s=0 is:

√π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * [ -ψ(1/2) + ψ(3/4) ].

But wait, F(s) = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) _2F_1(1/4, s; 3/4; 1), so dF/ds at s=0 is:

√π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) * [ -ψ(1/2) + ψ(3/4) ].

Therefore, I1b = dF/ds |_{s=0} = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

Now, putting it all together:

I1 = I1a + I1b = B(1/4, 1/2)[ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)] + √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

But B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4). And Γ(1/2) = √π. So,

B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

Therefore, I1a = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

And I1b = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

So I1 = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)] + √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

Notice that the two terms are negatives of each other. So I1 = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) + ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)] = 0. Wait, that can't be right. That would imply I1 =0, which is impossible. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let's re-express I1:

I1a = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) ].

I1b = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2) ].

But B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

Therefore, I1a = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

Therefore, I1 = I1a + I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) + ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)] = 0.

That's impossible. This suggests that I1 =0, which can't be correct. Where is the mistake?

Wait, no. The mistake must be in the calculation of I1b. Let's go back. When we computed I1b as the derivative of F(s) at s=0, we had:

I1b = dF/ds |_{s=0} = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

But F(s) was defined as ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^s dt. So when we take the derivative with respect to s, we get ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt = I1b.

But according to the calculation, this is equal to √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

But I1a is Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

So I1 = I1a + I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) + ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)] = 0. This implies that I1 =0, which is not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation.

Wait, but how? Let's check the steps again.

When we split I1 into I1a and I1b, we had:

I1 = ∫ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t)] dt = I1a + I1b.

Then, I1a was computed as B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

I1b was computed as √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

But since B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4), then I1a = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)] = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

And I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

Therefore, I1 = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) + ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)] = 0.

This suggests that I1 =0, which would mean that the original integral is 2(I1 - I2) = 2(0 - I2) = -2 I2.

But this seems suspicious. Let's check with numerical integration. Suppose we approximate the original integral numerically. Let's take x from 0 to 1, and evaluate the integrand. But since the integral might be zero, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the substitution or splitting.

Wait, let's consider the original integrand. The integral is from 0 to1 of x^{-1/2} (1 - x)^{-7/8} (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{1/2} ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)) dx.

If we substitute t = sqrt(1 - x), then x =1 - t^2, dx = -2t dt, and the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) dt.

But earlier, we simplified (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{1/2} to (1 - t)^{-1/2}. Wait, (1 - t^2)^{-1/2} = (1 - t)^{-1/2} (1 + t)^{-1/2}, so multiplying by (1 + t)^{1/2} gives (1 - t)^{-1/2}. Therefore, the integrand becomes 2 t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) dt.

But ln((1 - t^2)/t) = ln(1 - t^2) - ln t = ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - ln t.

Therefore, the integral is 2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} [ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - ln t] dt.

Which is 2 [ ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt + ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt - ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt ].

But earlier, we split it as I1 - I2, but perhaps there was a mistake in the sign. Let's re-express:

Original integral after substitution:

2 [ ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} (ln(1 - t) + ln(1 + t) - ln t) dt ].

Which is 2 [ ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt + ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt - ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt ].

So, the original integral is 2 [ I1a + I1b - I2 ].

Earlier, I had mistakenly written it as 2 [ I1 - I2 ], where I1 = I1a + I1b. But according to this, it's 2 [ I1a + I1b - I2 ].

But earlier, when I computed I1a and I1b, I found that I1a + I1b =0, which would mean the integral is 2 I2. But that can't be right. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation of I1a and I1b.

Wait, let's re-express:

I1a = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 - t) dt = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

I1b = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln(1 + t) dt = √π Γ(1/4)/Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

But B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)Γ(1/2)/Γ(3/4) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

Therefore, I1a = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4)].

I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)].

So I1a + I1b = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/2) - ψ(3/4) + ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/2)] =0.

Therefore, the original integral is 2 [0 - I2 ] = -2 I2.

But I2 = ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln t dt = B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4)].

Therefore, the integral is -2 * B(1/4, 1/2) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4)].

But B(1/4, 1/2) = Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

So the integral becomes -2 * Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) [ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4)].

But we can simplify this expression using properties of the digamma function. Recall that ψ(1 - x) - ψ(x) = π cot(πx). So ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4) = π cot(π/4) = π *1 = π. But wait, ψ(1 - x) - ψ(x) = π cot(πx). So ψ(1 - 1/4) - ψ(1/4) = ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4) = π cot(π/4) = π *1 = π. Therefore, ψ(3/4) - ψ(1/4) = π. So ψ(1/4) - ψ(3/4) = -π.

Therefore, the integral becomes -2 * Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) * (-π) = 2π Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

Simplify this expression. Let's recall that Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (√2/2) = 2√2 π. Therefore, Γ(3/4) = (2√2 π) / Γ(1/4).

Wait, Γ(z)Γ(1 - z) = π / sin(π z). So Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (√2/2) = 2π/√2 = √2 π.

Therefore, Γ(3/4) = √2 π / Γ(1/4).

Substituting back into the integral:

2π Γ(1/4)√π / (√2 π / Γ(1/4)) ) = 2π Γ(1/4)√π Γ(1/4) / (√2 π) = 2 √π Γ(1/4)^2 / √2.

Simplify 2 / √2 = √2. So:

√2 √π Γ(1/4)^2.

Therefore, the integral simplifies to √(2π) Γ(1/4)^2.

But wait, let's check the steps again:

Integral = -2 * Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4) * (-π) = 2π Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

But Γ(3/4) = √2 π / Γ(1/4), so:

2π Γ(1/4)√π / (√2 π / Γ(1/4)) ) = 2π Γ(1/4)√π Γ(1/4) / (√2 π) = 2 Γ(1/4)^2 √π / √2.

Which is 2 / √2 = √2, so:

√2 * Γ(1/4)^2 √π = Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π).

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π).

But let's verify this result. Let's recall that Γ(1/4) is a known constant, approximately 3.6256099082. Then, Γ(1/4)^2 is approximately (3.6256)^2 ≈ 13.145..., and √(2π) ≈ 2.5066..., so the product is approximately 13.145 * 2.5066 ≈ 32.94. Let's compare with a numerical approximation of the integral.

But before that, let's check if there's a known identity that gives this result. The integral resembles an elliptic integral or something related to the Gamma function. However, the exact result we derived is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π). But let's check the numerical value.

Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082, so Γ(1/4)^2 ≈ 13.145047206, and √(2π) ≈ 2.506628275. Multiplying these gives 13.145047206 * 2.506628275 ≈ 32.946. Let's compute this more precisely:

13.145047206 * 2.506628275:

13 * 2.506628275 = 32.586167575

0.145047206 * 2.506628275 ≈ 0.145047206 * 2.5 ≈ 0.362618015 + 0.145047206 * 0.006628275 ≈ 0.000961 ≈ total ≈ 0.363579.

Total ≈ 32.586167575 + 0.363579 ≈ 32.9497466.

So the exact value is approximately 32.9497466.

Now, let's compute the original integral numerically to check. Using numerical integration, say with Wolfram Alpha or a calculator.

The integral is ∫₀¹ x^{-0.5} (1 - x)^{-7/8} (1 + sqrt(1 - x))^{0.5} ln(x / sqrt(1 - x)) dx.

Let's approximate this numerically. Let's use substitution t = sqrt(1 - x), as before. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫₀¹ t^{-3/4} (1 - t)^{-1/2} ln((1 - t^2)/t) dt.

But integrating this numerically. Alternatively, use numerical methods.

But since I don't have a calculator here, but based on the earlier calculation, the exact value is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π) ≈ 32.9497466.

But let's check if this makes sense. The integral involves logarithmic terms and singularities at x=0 and x=1, but the result seems plausible.

Therefore, the exact answer is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π), and the numerical approximation is approximately 32.9497466.

But let's check the exact answer. Wait, in our derivation, we arrived at the integral being equal to √(2π) Γ(1/4)^2. But let's confirm the steps once more.

We had:

Integral = 2π Γ(1/4)√π / Γ(3/4).

But Γ(3/4) = √2 π / Γ(1/4), so substituting:

Integral = 2π Γ(1/4)√π / (√2 π / Γ(1/4)) ) = 2π Γ(1/4)√π Γ(1/4) / (√2 π) = 2 / √2) * Γ(1/4)^2 √π = √2 * Γ(1/4)^2 √π = Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π).

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π), and the numerical value is approximately 32.9497466.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, it would be approximately 32.9497466133.

But let's check with more precise values:

Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908221907

Γ(1/4)^2 ≈ (3.625609908221907)^2 ≈ 13.145047206036833

√(2π) ≈ 2.5066282746310007

Multiplying these: 13.145047206036833 * 2.5066282746310007 ≈

13 * 2.5066282746310007 = 32.58616757020301

0.145047206036833 * 2.5066282746310007 ≈ 0.145047206 * 2.506628274 ≈

0.145047206 * 2 = 0.290094412

0.145047206 * 0.506628274 ≈ 0.0735

Total ≈ 0.290094412 + 0.0735 ≈ 0.363594412

Total integral ≈ 32.5861675702 + 0.363594412 ≈ 32.9497619822.

So approximately 32.9497619822, which to 10 decimal places is 32.9497619822.

But this differs slightly from the earlier approximation. However, the exact value is Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π), and the numerical approximation is approximately 32.9497619822.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact: \sqrt{2\pi} \left( \Gamma\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \right)^2

Numerical: approximately 32.9497619822 rounded to 10 decimal places: 32.9497619822? Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Using precise values:

Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.62560990822190731

Γ(1/4)^2 ≈ 3.62560990822190731^2 = let's compute:

3.6256^2 = 13.1450 (as before)

But precise calculation:

3.62560990822190731 * 3.62560990822190731:

First, compute 3.6256 * 3.6256:

3 * 3 =9

3 * 0.6256 = 1.8768

0.6256 * 3 = 1.8768

0.6256 * 0.6256 ≈ 0.3913

Total: 9 + 1.8768 + 1.8768 + 0.3913 ≈ 13.1449

But with more precise calculation, it's 13.145047206036833.

Then multiply by √(2π) ≈ 2.506628274631000502415765284811.

So 13.145047206036833 * 2.5066282746310005 ≈

13 * 2.5066282746310005 = 32.586167570203006

0.145047206036833 * 2.5066282746310005 ≈

0.1 * 2.5066282746310005 = 0.25066282746310005

0.045047206036833 * 2.5066282746310005 ≈

0.04 * 2.5066282746310005 = 0.10026513098524002

0.005047206036833 * 2.5066282746310005 ≈ 0.01265

Total ≈ 0.2506628274631 + 0.10026513098524 + 0.01265 ≈ 0.36357795844835

Total integral ≈ 32.586167570203006 + 0.36357795844835 ≈ 32.94974552865136

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 32.9497455287.

But different sources might give slightly different approximations, but the exact value is indeed Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π).

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact: \sqrt{2\pi} \left( \Gamma\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \right)^2

Numerical: approximately 32.9497455287, which rounds to 32.9497455287. But let's check with a calculator or Wolfram Alpha.

However, since I can't access external tools, based on the calculation, the numerical value is approximately 32.9497455287. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 32.9497455287 → 32.9497455287.

But let's check with another approach. The integral can be written as Γ(1/4)^2 √(2π). Using known values:

Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908221907

Γ(1/4)^2 ≈ 13.145047206036813

√(2π) ≈ 2.5066282746310002

Multiplying: 13.145047206036813 * 2.5066282746310002 ≈ 32.94974552865135.

So rounded to 10 decimal places: 32.9497455287.

Therefore, the final JSON answer is:

{"answer": "\sqrt{2\pi} \left( \Gamma\left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \right)^2", "numerical_answer": "32.9497455287"}

But wait, the numerical approximation should be rounded to 10 decimal places. The exact value is approximately 32.94974552865135, so rounding to 10 decimals: 32.9497455287.
