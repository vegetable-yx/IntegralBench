Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral is from 0 to π/4 of [tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)] divided by [tan(x) + sec²(x)] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the integrand first.

First, let me write down the integrand:

Numerator: tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)

Denominator: tan(x) + sec²(x)

I need to see if the numerator can be expressed in terms of the denominator or if there's a substitution that can simplify this. Let me check if the numerator is part of the derivative of the denominator or something like that. Let's compute the derivative of the denominator.

Denominator D(x) = tan(x) + sec²(x)

Derivative D'(x) = sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x)

Wait, that's interesting. The derivative of the denominator is sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x). Let me look back at the numerator:

Numerator: tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)

Hmm, if I group terms:

= [tan(x) + 2 sec²(x)] + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)

But the denominator is tan(x) + sec²(x). Let me see if the numerator can be written as the denominator plus the derivative of the denominator. Let's check:

Denominator: tan(x) + sec²(x)

Derivative of denominator: sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x)

So, if I take the denominator and add its derivative, that would be:

tan(x) + sec²(x) + sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x) = tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x)

Wait, that's exactly the numerator! So the numerator is equal to the denominator plus the derivative of the denominator. So the integrand becomes:

[ D(x) + D'(x) ] / D(x) = 1 + D'(x)/D(x)

Therefore, the integral becomes the integral of 1 dx plus the integral of D'(x)/D(x) dx. The integral of 1 dx is just x, and the integral of D'(x)/D(x) dx is ln|D(x)| + C. So putting it all together, the integral is x + ln|D(x)| evaluated from 0 to π/4.

So let's write that out:

Integral = [x + ln(tan(x) + sec²(x))] from 0 to π/4

Now, let's compute the bounds. First, evaluate at π/4:

At x = π/4:

tan(π/4) = 1

sec(π/4) = sqrt(2), so sec²(π/4) = 2

Therefore, D(π/4) = 1 + 2 = 3

So the upper limit part is π/4 + ln(3)

Now, the lower limit at x = 0:

tan(0) = 0

sec(0) = 1, so sec²(0) = 1

Therefore, D(0) = 0 + 1 = 1

So the lower limit part is 0 + ln(1) = 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the definite integral is [π/4 + ln(3)] - [0] = π/4 + ln(3)

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the substitution: recognizing that the numerator is D(x) + D'(x). Let me check that again.

Numerator: tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)

D(x) = tan(x) + sec²(x)

D'(x) = sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x)

So D(x) + D'(x) = tan(x) + sec²(x) + sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x) = tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x), which matches the numerator. Perfect, that's correct.

Therefore, the integrand simplifies to 1 + D'(x)/D(x), so integrating term by term gives x + ln|D(x)|. Since D(x) is positive in the interval [0, π/4], we can drop the absolute value.

Evaluating from 0 to π/4 gives π/4 + ln(3) - (0 + ln(1)) = π/4 + ln(3). That's the exact answer.

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute π/4 + ln(3).

First, approximately, π ≈ 3.1415926536, so π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634.

ln(3) is approximately 1.0986122887.

Adding them together: 0.7853981634 + 1.0986122887 ≈ 1.8840104521.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.8840104521.

Wait, let me check the exact decimal places. Let me compute more precisely.

π/4 ≈ 0.7853981633974483...

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098...

Adding them: 0.7853981633974483 + 1.0986122886681098 = 1.8840104520655581...

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.8840104521

Yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is π/4 + ln(3), and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.8840104521.
