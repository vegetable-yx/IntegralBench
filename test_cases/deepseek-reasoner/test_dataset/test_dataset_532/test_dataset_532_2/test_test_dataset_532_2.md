Okay, let's tackle this integral: ∫₀²π arccos(sin x) dx. Hmm, arccos of sine x... That seems a bit tricky. First, I need to recall some trigonometric identities or properties that might simplify this expression.

Wait, arccos(sin x)... Maybe I can express sin x in terms of cosine to make it easier. Since sin x is cosine shifted by π/2, right? Like sin x = cos(π/2 - x). So arccos(cos(π/2 - x))? But arccos(cos θ) is equal to θ when θ is in [0, π], and 2π - θ when θ is in [π, 2π], or something like that. Wait, but the range of arccos is [0, π], so if the argument is cos(θ), then arccos(cos θ) = |θ + 2πk| for some integer k to bring it into the principal value. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for the periodicity.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arccos(sin x) and some other angle. Let me think. If I let θ = arccos(sin x), then cos θ = sin x. But sin x is equal to cos(π/2 - x), so cos θ = cos(π/2 - x). Therefore, θ = π/2 - x + 2πk or θ = -(π/2 - x) + 2πk. But since θ must be in [0, π], I need to find the correct k and sign.

Let me solve for θ. So θ = arccos(sin x) implies that θ = |π/2 - x| + 2πn, but adjusted to be within [0, π]. Wait, maybe it's better to consider different intervals for x where the expression simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me consider the integral over 0 to 2π. Since the integrand involves sin x, which has a period of 2π, maybe the integral over 0 to 2π can be broken into intervals where the expression arccos(sin x) simplifies.

Let me consider the function arccos(sin x). Let's analyze its behavior. The sin x function ranges between -1 and 1, but since arccos is defined for arguments between -1 and 1, that's okay. However, arccos is a decreasing function from 0 to π as the input goes from 1 to -1. So when sin x is 1, arccos(sin x) is arccos(1) = 0. When sin x is 0, arccos(0) = π/2. When sin x is -1, arccos(-1) = π.

But how does arccos(sin x) behave as x varies? Let's plot it mentally. For x from 0 to π/2, sin x increases from 0 to 1, so arccos(sin x) decreases from π/2 to 0. For x from π/2 to 3π/2, sin x decreases from 1 to -1, so arccos(sin x) increases from 0 to π. Then from 3π/2 to 2π, sin x increases from -1 back to 0, so arccos(sin x) decreases from π to π/2. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me check specific points.

At x = 0: sin 0 = 0, arccos(0) = π/2.

At x = π/2: sin(π/2) = 1, arccos(1) = 0.

At x = π: sin π = 0, arccos(0) = π/2.

At x = 3π/2: sin(3π/2) = -1, arccos(-1) = π.

At x = 2π: sin(2π) = 0, arccos(0) = π/2.

So the function arccos(sin x) seems to have a period of π? Wait, from 0 to 2π, but maybe it's symmetric over certain intervals. Let me see. From 0 to π/2, it's decreasing from π/2 to 0. Then from π/2 to 3π/2, it's increasing from 0 to π and then decreasing? Wait, maybe not. Let's take x between π/2 and 3π/2. Let's pick x = π: sin π = 0, so arccos(0) = π/2. At x = 3π/2, sin x = -1, arccos(-1) = π. So between π/2 and 3π/2, sin x goes from 1 down to -1, so arccos(sin x) goes from 0 up to π. Then from 3π/2 to 2π, sin x goes from -1 back to 0, so arccos(sin x) goes from π back to π/2. Hmm, so the graph of arccos(sin x) is a series of triangles?

Wait, maybe if I can express arccos(sin x) in terms of |x - π/2| or something. Let me think. Let's consider θ = x - π/2. Then sin x = sin(θ + π/2) = cos θ. So arccos(sin x) = arccos(cos θ). Now, arccos(cos θ) is equal to |θ| when θ is in [-π, π], but since θ = x - π/2, and x ranges from 0 to 2π, θ ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2. So in this interval, arccos(cos θ) would be equal to |θ| when θ is in [-π/2, π/2], and 2π - θ when θ is in [π/2, 3π/2]. Wait, no. The standard identity is that arccos(cos θ) = |θ - 2πk| where k is chosen such that the result is in [0, π]. Let me check.

For θ in [0, π], arccos(cos θ) = θ. For θ in [π, 2π], arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. But here θ ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2. So for θ in [-π/2, π/2], arccos(cos θ) = |θ|. For θ in [π/2, 3π/2], arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. Wait, but 2π - θ when θ is in [π/2, 3π/2] would give values from 2π - π/2 = 3π/2 down to 2π - 3π/2 = π/2. But arccos(cos θ) must be in [0, π]. Wait, maybe I need to adjust differently.

Alternatively, since cos is even and periodic, arccos(cos θ) = |θ + 2πk| where k is chosen so that the angle is in [0, π]. Let's take θ in [-π/2, 3π/2]. For θ in [-π/2, π/2], arccos(cos θ) = |θ|. For θ in [π/2, 3π/2], arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. Wait, but 2π - θ when θ is in [π/2, 3π/2] would give 2π - π/2 = 3π/2, which is outside [0, π]. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's think again. The arccos(cos θ) is the angle in [0, π] whose cosine is equal to cos θ. So if θ is in [0, π], then arccos(cos θ) = θ. If θ is in [π, 2π], then arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. But if θ is negative, say θ = -α where α > 0, then cos θ = cos(-α) = cos α, so arccos(cos θ) = arccos(cos α) = α, since α is positive and in [0, π] if α ≤ π. So for θ in [-π, 0], arccos(cos θ) = -θ.

So in our case, θ = x - π/2, which ranges from -π/2 (when x=0) to 3π/2 (when x=2π). So for θ in [-π/2, 0], arccos(cos θ) = -θ. For θ in [0, π], arccos(cos θ) = θ. For θ in [π, 3π/2], arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. Wait, but 2π - θ when θ is in [π, 3π/2] would be 2π - π = π down to 2π - 3π/2 = π/2. So in that interval, arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ. But 2π - θ is in [π/2, π], which is within the range of arccos.

Therefore, putting it all together:

arccos(sin x) = arccos(cos θ) where θ = x - π/2.

So:

- When θ ∈ [-π/2, 0] (i.e., x ∈ [0, π/2]), arccos(cos θ) = -θ = π/2 - x.

- When θ ∈ [0, π] (i.e., x ∈ [π/2, 3π/2]), arccos(cos θ) = θ = x - π/2.

Wait, no. Wait, θ = x - π/2. So for x ∈ [0, π/2], θ ∈ [-π/2, 0], so arccos(cos θ) = -θ = π/2 - x.

For x ∈ [π/2, 3π/2], θ ∈ [0, π], so arccos(cos θ) = θ = x - π/2.

For x ∈ [3π/2, 2π], θ ∈ [π, 3π/2], so arccos(cos θ) = 2π - θ = 2π - (x - π/2) = 2π - x + π/2 = (5π/2 - x).

Wait, but 2π - θ when θ is in [π, 3π/2] would be 2π - θ. So θ = x - π/2, so 2π - (x - π/2) = 2π - x + π/2 = (5π/2 - x). But 5π/2 - x when x is in [3π/2, 2π], so 5π/2 - 2π = π/2, and 5π/2 - 3π/2 = π. So in this interval, arccos(sin x) = 5π/2 - x, which ranges from π to π/2. Wait, but 5π/2 - x when x is in [3π/2, 2π] would decrease from π to π/2 as x increases from 3π/2 to 2π. That seems correct.

So putting it all together:

arccos(sin x) =

- π/2 - x, for x ∈ [0, π/2]

- x - π/2, for x ∈ [π/2, 3π/2]

- 5π/2 - x, for x ∈ [3π/2, 2π]

Therefore, the integral can be split into three parts:

Integral from 0 to π/2 of (π/2 - x) dx

Plus integral from π/2 to 3π/2 of (x - π/2) dx

Plus integral from 3π/2 to 2π of (5π/2 - x) dx

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - x) dx

Antiderivative: (π/2)x - (1/2)x² evaluated from 0 to π/2.

At π/2: (π/2)(π/2) - (1/2)(π/2)² = (π²/4) - (1/2)(π²/4) = (π²/4) - (π²/8) = π²/8.

At 0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So first integral is π²/8.

Second integral: ∫_{π/2}^{3π/2} (x - π/2) dx

Antiderivative: (1/2)x² - (π/2)x evaluated from π/2 to 3π/2.

At 3π/2: (1/2)(3π/2)² - (π/2)(3π/2) = (1/2)(9π²/4) - (3π²/4) = (9π²/8) - (3π²/4) = (9π²/8 - 6π²/8) = 3π²/8.

At π/2: (1/2)(π/2)² - (π/2)(π/2) = (1/2)(π²/4) - (π²/4) = (π²/8) - (π²/4) = -π²/8.

Subtracting: 3π²/8 - (-π²/8) = 4π²/8 = π²/2.

Third integral: ∫_{3π/2}^{2π} (5π/2 - x) dx

Antiderivative: (5π/2)x - (1/2)x² evaluated from 3π/2 to 2π.

At 2π: (5π/2)(2π) - (1/2)(2π)² = 5π² - (1/2)(4π²) = 5π² - 2π² = 3π².

At 3π/2: (5π/2)(3π/2) - (1/2)(3π/2)² = (15π²/4) - (1/2)(9π²/4) = (15π²/4) - (9π²/8) = (30π²/8 - 9π²/8) = 21π²/8.

Subtracting: 3π² - 21π²/8 = (24π²/8 - 21π²/8) = 3π²/8.

Adding all three integrals: π²/8 + π²/2 + 3π²/8.

Convert to eighths: π²/8 + 4π²/8 + 3π²/8 = 8π²/8 = π².

So the exact value of the integral is π².

Now, for the numerical approximation. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π² ≈ (3.1415926536)^2 ≈ 9.8696044011.

Let me verify that calculation. 3.1415926536 squared:

3.1415926536 * 3.1415926536

First, 3 * 3.1415926536 ≈ 9.4247779608

But more accurately:

3.1415926536 × 3.1415926536:

Let me compute step by step:

3.1415926536 × 3.1415926536

= (3 + 0.1415926536) × (3 + 0.1415926536)

= 3×3 + 3×0.1415926536 + 0.1415926536×3 + 0.1415926536²

= 9 + 0.4247779608 + 0.4247779608 + 0.02004847577

= 9 + 0.8495559216 + 0.02004847577 ≈ 9.86960439737

So approximately 9.8696043974, which rounds to 9.8696043974. But let me check with a calculator. π² is indeed approximately 9.869604401089358, so rounding to 10 decimal places would be 9.8696044011.

Therefore, the numerical approximation is 9.8696044011.
