Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of arccos(sin x) from 0 to 2π. Hmm, arccos and sin functions can be tricky. Let me start by understanding the integrand better. The function inside the integral is arccos(sin x). I should recall some trigonometric identities or properties that might simplify this expression.

Wait, I remember that sin x can be written in terms of cosine using a phase shift. Since sin x = cos(π/2 - x), maybe that can help. But arccos(cos θ) is equal to θ when θ is in [0, π], right? But here, the argument of arccos is sin x, which is cos(π/2 - x). So arccos(sin x) would be arccos(cos(π/2 - x)). 

But arccos(cos θ) isn't always θ. It depends on the value of θ. The arccos function returns values in [0, π], so if θ is in that interval, it's θ. Otherwise, it's adjusted by adding or subtracting multiples of 2π or taking the negative. Let me think. If θ = π/2 - x, then depending on x, θ can be in different ranges. 

Wait, x is from 0 to 2π, so θ = π/2 - x would range from π/2 to -3π/2. But arccos(cos θ) is equal to |θ + 2π k| where k is chosen such that the result is in [0, π]. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try to graph the function arccos(sin x) over the interval 0 to 2π to see if there's a pattern or symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me set t = x - π/2. Then sin x = sin(t + π/2) = cos t. So arccos(sin x) becomes arccos(cos t). But t would range from -π/2 to 3π/2 when x goes from 0 to 2π. Then arccos(cos t) is equal to |t| when t is in [-π, π], but since t ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2, maybe I need to split the integral into parts where t is in different intervals.

Wait, arccos(cos t) is equal to |t| if t in [-π, π], but when t is outside that interval, it's adjusted by 2π. Let me check. For example, if t is in [π, 2π], then arccos(cos t) = 2π - t. But in our substitution, t ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2. So for t in [-π/2, π/2], arccos(cos t) = |t|, which is t since t is positive here. Wait, no. If t is negative, like -π/2, then arccos(cos(-π/2)) = arccos(0) = π/2. But |t| would be π/2. So yes, arccos(cos t) = |t| when t is in [-π, π]. Wait, when t is in [0, π], arccos(cos t) = t, and when t is in [-π, 0], arccos(cos t) = -t. So overall, arccos(cos t) = |t| for t in [-π, π]. But when t is outside that interval, like t > π, then arccos(cos t) = 2π - t. Wait, no. Let me verify with specific values. For t = 3π/2, cos(3π/2) is 0, so arccos(0) is π/2. But 2π - t would be 2π - 3π/2 = π/2. So yes, for t in [π, 2π], arccos(cos t) = 2π - t. Similarly, for t in [-π, 0], arccos(cos t) = -t. So combining these, arccos(cos t) is equal to |t| when t in [-π, π], and 2π - t when t in [π, 2π], but in our substitution, t ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2. So let's split the integral into parts where t is in [-π/2, π/2], [π/2, 3π/2]. Wait, but when t is in [π/2, 3π/2], which is equivalent to x in [π, 2π], since t = x - π/2. So, substituting t = x - π/2, the integral becomes:

∫_{x=0}^{2π} arccos(sin x) dx = ∫_{t=-π/2}^{3π/2} arccos(cos t) dt.

Now, we can split this integral into two parts where t is in [-π/2, π/2] and [π/2, 3π/2].

For t in [-π/2, π/2], arccos(cos t) = |t|. But since t is in [-π/2, π/2], |t| is just the absolute value. Wait, but when t is negative, like t = -a where a is positive, arccos(cos(-a)) = arccos(cos a) = a = |t|. So yes, in this interval, arccos(cos t) = |t|.

For t in [π/2, 3π/2], arccos(cos t) = 2π - t? Wait, let's check t = π. cos π = -1, arccos(-1) = π. 2π - π = π, which matches. For t = 3π/2, arccos(cos 3π/2) = arccos(0) = π/2. 2π - 3π/2 = π/2. So yes, for t in [π, 3π/2], arccos(cos t) = 2π - t. Wait, but what about t in [π/2, π]? Let's take t = π/2. arccos(cos π/2) = arccos(0) = π/2. 2π - π/2 = 3π/2, which is not equal to π/2. Wait, that's a problem. So my previous assumption is incorrect. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula for different intervals.

Wait, arccos(cos t) is equal to t when t is in [0, π], and 2π - t when t is in [π, 2π]. But in our case, t ranges from -π/2 to 3π/2. So let's split the integral into three intervals:

1. t in [-π/2, 0]: here, arccos(cos t) = -t (since cos t is even, and arccos(cos t) = |t|, but t is negative here, so |t| = -t.

Wait, no. Wait, arccos(cos t) is equal to |t| when t is in [-π, π]. For t in [-π/2, 0], |t| = -t. So arccos(cos t) = -t.

For t in [0, π], arccos(cos t) = t.

For t in [π, 3π/2], arccos(cos t) = 2π - t.

So splitting the integral:

∫_{-π/2}^{3π/2} arccos(cos t) dt = ∫_{-π/2}^0 (-t) dt + ∫_{0}^π t dt + ∫_{π}^{3π/2} (2π - t) dt.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: ∫_{-π/2}^0 (-t) dt. Let's compute the antiderivative. The integral of -t dt is - (t^2)/2. Evaluated from -π/2 to 0:

[ -0^2/2 ] - [ - (-π/2)^2 /2 ] = 0 - [ - (π²/4)/2 ] = 0 - (-π²/8) = π²/8.

Second integral: ∫_{0}^π t dt. Antiderivative is t²/2. Evaluated from 0 to π:

(π²/2) - 0 = π²/2.

Third integral: ∫_{π}^{3π/2} (2π - t) dt. Antiderivative is 2π t - t²/2. Evaluated from π to 3π/2:

[2π*(3π/2) - (3π/2)^2 /2] - [2π*π - π²/2]

Compute first term:

2π*(3π/2) = 3π²

(3π/2)^2 /2 = (9π²/4)/2 = 9π²/8

So first part: 3π² - 9π²/8 = (24π²/8 - 9π²/8) = 15π²/8

Second term:

2π*π = 2π²

π²/2

So second part: 2π² - π²/2 = (4π²/2 - π²/2) = 3π²/2 = 12π²/8

So the third integral is 15π²/8 - 12π²/8 = 3π²/8.

Adding all three integrals:

π²/8 + π²/2 + 3π²/8 = π²/8 + 4π²/8 + 3π²/8 = 8π²/8 = π².

So the total is π². Therefore, the original integral is equal to π².

Wait, but let me check if I did the substitution correctly. The substitution was t = x - π/2, so dx = dt. The limits when x=0, t=-π/2; x=2π, t=3π/2. So the integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{3π/2} arccos(cos t) dt, which we split into three parts and got π². So the answer is π².

But let me verify with a numerical approximation. π² is approximately 9.8696044. Let me check with a simple numerical integration. For example, the function arccos(sin x) is periodic with period 2π, so integrating over 0 to 2π should give the same as integrating over any interval of length 2π. Let me check the function's behavior.

Alternatively, since we split the integral into three parts and each part added up to π², the analytical result is π². The numerical approximation would be approximately 9.8696044, which is π squared. So the numerical answer is 9.8696044011 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Wait, the exact answer is π squared, so in LaTeX, that's \pi^2. The numerical approximation is approximately 9.8696044010. Let me confirm with a calculator. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π² is (3.1415926536)^2 = 9.8696044011, yes. So rounding to 10 decimal places, it be 9.8696044011. But since the 11th decimal is 0, it's 9.8696044011. But depending on the exact calculation, maybe it's 9.8696044010. Wait, let me compute 3.141592653589793^2:

3.141592653589793 * 3.141592653589793:

= (3.141592653589793)^2

= 9.869604401089358...

So up to 10 decimal places, it's 9.8696044011 (since the 11th digit is 8, which rounds up the 10th decimal from 0 to 1). Wait, 9.869604401089358... So the 10th decimal is the 9th after the decimal: 9.8696044010 (positions: 0:9, 1:8, 2:6, 3:9, 4:6, 5:0, 6:4, 7:4, 8:0, 9:1, 10:0... Wait, maybe I'm counting wrong. Let's write it out:

9.8 6 9 6 0 4 4 0 1 0 8 9...

So the first digit after the decimal is 8, then 6, 6, 9, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 8, 9...

Wait, no. Wait, 9.869604401089358 is the value. Let's break it down:

Digits after the decimal: 8, 6, 9, 6, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 8, 9, 3, 5, 8,...

So the first decimal place is 8, second 6, third 9, fourth 6, fifth 0, sixth 4, seventh 4, eighth 0, ninth 1, tenth 0. Then the tenth decimal place is 0, and the next digit is 8, which would round the tenth place up by 1. So the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is 9.8696044011.

But wait, the exact digits are 9.869604401089358... So up to 10 decimal places: 9.8696044011 (since the 10th is 0 followed by 8, which rounds up to 1). So the numerical answer is 9.8696044011.

But let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, since the integral is π², which is approximately 9.869604401089358..., so rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 9.8696044011. But sometimes, depending on the rounding rules, if the 11th digit is 8, which is more than 5, we round the 10th up. So 0 becomes 1. Hence, 9.8696044011.

Therefore, the final answer is π squared, and the numerical approximation is approximately 9.8696044011.
