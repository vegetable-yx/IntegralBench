Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x) * arccos(x) * I₁(2x) dx. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I₁ is. I₁ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 1. I remember that Bessel functions often come up in problems involving cylindrical coordinates or certain integral transforms. But I'm not too familiar with their properties off the top of my head. Maybe I should look up some integral representations or series expansions for I₁(2x) that could be useful here.

The integrand has arccos(x), which is the inverse cosine function. The presence of 1/x suggests that there might be a substitution to simplify the expression. Let me think about possible substitutions. If I let t = x, but that's trivial. Maybe integrating by parts? Let's consider integrating by parts. Let u = arccos(x) and dv = (1/x) I₁(2x) dx. Then du would be -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v would be the integral of (1/x) I₁(2x) dx. Hmm, but integrating (1/x) I₁(2x) dx might not be straightforward. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding the Bessel function into its series representation. The modified Bessel function I₁(2x) has a series expansion. Let me recall that.

The modified Bessel function of the first kind I_n(z) has the series representation:

I_n(z) = (z/2)^n * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (z^2/4)^k / (k! Γ(n + k + 1)) ]

For n = 1, this becomes:

I₁(z) = (z/2) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (z²/4)^k / (k! (k + 1)!) ) ]

So substituting z = 2x, we get:

I₁(2x) = (2x/2) * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ ( (2x)^2 /4 )^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] = x * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (x²)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ]

Simplifying that, it's x * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So, substituting this into the integral, we have:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) * I₁(2x) dx = ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) * [x Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] dx

The x in the numerator from I₁(2x) cancels with the 1/x, so we get:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] dx

Now, if we can interchange the integral and the summation, then we can write this as Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx

Assuming uniform convergence, which I think holds here because the Bessel function series converges nicely on [0,1], we can proceed.

So now the problem reduces to computing the integral of arccos(x) x^{2k} dx from 0 to 1 for each k, then summing over k with coefficients 1/(k! (k + 1)! )

So let's focus on the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx.

To compute this integral, perhaps integration by parts. Let me set u = arccos(x), dv = x^{2k} dx.

Then du = -1 / sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v = x^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)

So integration by parts gives:

uv | from 0 to 1 - ∫₀¹ v du

So:

[ arccos(x) * x^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) ] from 0 to 1 + ∫₀¹ [x^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)] * [1 / sqrt(1 - x²)] dx

Evaluating the boundary terms. At x=1, arccos(1) = 0, and x^{2k +1} is 1, so term is 0. At x=0, arccos(0) = π/2, and x^{2k +1} is 0, so the entire boundary part is 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/(2k + 1)) ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

So now we have:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k + 1)) ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Let me compute this integral. Let me make substitution t = x². Then dt = 2x dx, so x dx = dt/2. But the current integral is x^{2k +1} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let me write x^{2k +1} as x^{2k} * x. Then, substituting t = x², so x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Then:

x^{2k} * x / sqrt(1 - x²) dx = t^{k} * sqrt(t) / sqrt(1 - t) * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt

Simplify:

t^{k} * sqrt(t) / sqrt(1 - t) * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt = t^{k} / sqrt(1 - t) * (1/2) dt

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/2) ∫₀¹ t^{k} / sqrt(1 - t) dt

Which is (1/2) ∫₀¹ t^{k} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt

This is a Beta function integral. Recall that:

∫₀¹ t^{c - 1} (1 - t)^{d - 1} dt = B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d) / Γ(c + d)

In this case, c = k + 1, d = 1/2. So:

(1/2) * B(k + 1, 1/2) = (1/2) * Γ(k + 1) Γ(1/2) / Γ(k + 1 + 1/2)

We know that Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), and Γ(k + 1) = k!.

So:

(1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2)

Now, Γ(k + 3/2) can be expressed using the double factorial or the gamma function relation. Recall that Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π) / (4^n n!) )

Wait, more precisely, for integer n:

Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! / (4^n n!) ) sqrt(π)

So for Γ(k + 3/2) where k is an integer, let's set n = k + 1. Then Γ(n + 1/2) = Γ(k + 1 + 1/2) = (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π)

But let me check:

Yes, Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! / (4^n n!) ) sqrt(π) for integer n ≥ 0.

So here, n = k + 1/2. Wait, no. Wait, Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ( (k + 1) + 1/2 ) = (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π)

Therefore, substituting back:

(1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / [ (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The sqrt(π) cancels out. So:

(1/2) * k! / [ (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) ]

Which is (1/2) * k! * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

Note that (2(k + 1))! = (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But maybe there's a better way to express this.

Alternatively, note that (2(k + 1))! = (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But perhaps we can write (2(k + 1))! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

Wait, but maybe not. Let's see.

Alternatively, using the duplication formula for Gamma functions:

Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z)

But I'm not sure if that helps here. Let's proceed step by step.

So, the expression is (1/2) * k! * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

Let me write 4^{k + 1} as 2^{2(k + 1)} = 2^{2k + 2}

So:

(1/2) * k! * 2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)! / (2k + 2)! )

Simplify 2^{2k + 2} / 2 = 2^{2k + 1}

So:

2^{2k + 1} * k! (k + 1)! / (2k + 2)! )

Now, (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But maybe we can write (2k + 2)! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

Wait, the double factorial identity: (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!! )

But here, n = k + 1, so (2(k + 1))! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

Therefore, substituting into the denominator:

2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

So the expression becomes:

2^{2k + 1} * k! (k + 1)! / [2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! ) ]

Simplify:

2^{2k + 1} / 2^{k + 1} = 2^{k}

k! (k + 1)! / (k + 1)! ) = k!

So we have 2^{k} * k! / (2k + 1)!! )

But (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...3*1. Also, (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Wait, yes:

(2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...5*3*1 = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Therefore, substituting back:

2^{k} * k! / [ (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ] = 2^{k} * k! * 2^k k! / (2k + 1)! ) = 2^{2k} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k + 1)) * [ (1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2) ) ] simplifies to:

But wait, according to the previous steps, we have:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k + 1)) * [ (1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2) ) ] = [k! sqrt(π) ] / [2(2k + 1) Γ(k + 3/2) ]

But through substitution, we arrived at 2^{2k} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! )

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, after simplifying, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx is equal to:

(1/(2k + 1)) * (1/2) * B(k + 1, 1/2) ) = (1/(2(2k + 1))) * B(k + 1, 1/2)

But B(k + 1, 1/2) = Γ(k + 1)Γ(1/2)/Γ(k + 1 + 1/2) = k! sqrt(π)/Γ(k + 3/2)

So the integral is:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! sqrt(π)/Γ(k + 3/2)

But Γ(k + 3/2) can be written as (2k + 2)! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π) )

Wait, no. Wait, earlier we had Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 2)! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π) )

Wait, no, that was for Γ(n + 1/2) where n is integer. Let me check.

Actually, the formula is Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! / 4^n n! ) sqrt(π) * 2. Wait, no. Let me recall:

For integer n ≥ 0,

Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! / (4^n n! ) sqrt(π)

So for Γ(k + 3/2), set n = k + 1. Then,

Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ( (k + 1) + 1/2 ) = (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π)

Therefore, substituting back into the integral:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! sqrt(π) / [ (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) sqrt(π) ) ]

The sqrt(π) cancels:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! / [ (2(k + 1))! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) ]

= (1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4^{k + 1} = 2^{2(k + 1)} = 2^{2k + 2}

So:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! * 2^{2k + 2} (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

= (1/(2(2k + 1))) * 2^{2k + 2} * k! (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

Note that 2^{2k + 2} / 2 = 2^{2k + 1}

So:

(2^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)) * k! (k + 1)! / (2(k + 1))! )

Now, 2(k + 1))! = (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

But perhaps we can express (2k + 2)! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

Using the identity (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!! )

So for n = k + 1, (2(k + 1))! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

Therefore, substituting:

(2^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)) * k! (k + 1)! / [2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! ) ]

Simplify:

2^{2k + 1} / 2^{k + 1} = 2^{k}

(k + 1)! cancels out.

So:

2^{k} * k! / [ (2k + 1) (2k + 1)!! ) ]

But (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...3*1

Also, note that (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Yes, because:

(2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)(2k - 1)...2*1 = (2k + 1)!! * 2^k k!

Therefore, (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Substituting back:

2^{k} * k! / [ (2k + 1) * ( (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ) ]

= 2^{k} * k! * 2^k k! / [ (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ]

= 2^{2k} (k! )² / [ (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ]

But (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! )

So:

= 2^{2k} (k! )² / [ (2k + 1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to express this.

Alternatively, let's recall that the integral we computed is:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = 2^{2k} (k! )² / ( (2k + 1)^2 (2k)! ) )

But I need to check if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler expression.

Alternatively, let's recall that the integral ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx can be expressed in terms of the Beta function, which we did, and then expressed in terms of Gamma functions. So perhaps we can leave it in terms of Gamma functions.

So, going back:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k + 1)) * (1/2) * B(k + 1, 1/2) = (1/(2(2k + 1))) * Γ(k + 1)Γ(1/2) / Γ(k + 1 + 1/2)

Which is (1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2)

But Γ(k + 3/2) can be written as (sqrt(π)/2^{2k + 1}) ) * (2k + 2)! ) / ( (k + 1)! ) )

Wait, no. Let me use the duplication formula again. The duplication formula says:

Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z)

Let me set z = k + 1. Then Γ(k + 1)Γ(k + 1 + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2(k + 1)} sqrt(π) Γ(2k + 2)

But Γ(k + 1) = k! and Γ(2k + 2) = (2k + 1)! )

So:

k! Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{ -2k -1 } sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! )

Therefore, Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{ -2k -1 } sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) / k! )

So substituting back into the integral:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! sqrt(π) / [ 2^{ -2k -1 } sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) / k! ) ]

Simplify:

The sqrt(π) cancels. The k! cancels with the denominator's k!.

So:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * 1 / [ 2^{ -2k -1 } (2k + 1)! ) ]

= (1/(2(2k + 1))) * 2^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)! )

= (2^{2k + 1} ) / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) )

= 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) )

Hmm, so ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = 2^{2k} / [ (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ]

Wait, but this seems different from previous steps. Let me check again.

Wait, according to the duplication formula:

Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z)

So for z = k + 1:

Γ(k + 1)Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{1 - 2(k + 1)} sqrt(π) Γ(2k + 2)

Which is:

k! Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{-2k -1} sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! )

Therefore, Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{-2k -1} sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) / k! )

So substituting into the integral expression:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * k! sqrt(π) / [ 2^{-2k -1} sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) / k! ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The sqrt(π) cancels. The k! in the numerator cancels with the k! in the denominator.

So:

(1/(2(2k + 1))) * 1 / [ 2^{-2k -1} (2k + 1)! ) ]

= (1/(2(2k + 1))) * 2^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)! )

= (2^{2k + 1} ) / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) )

= 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) )

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = 2^{2k} / [ (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ]

So now, going back to the original sum:

The original integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

So combining the terms:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ]

This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a way to simplify this sum.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known series expansion that matches this sum. Let me think about known series involving Bessel functions or hypergeometric functions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can recognize this sum as a hypergeometric function. Let's recall that hypergeometric functions are represented by series involving ratios of factorials. The generalized hypergeometric function is defined as:

_pF_q(a_1, ..., a_p; b_1, ..., b_q; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (a_1)_k ... (a_p)_k / (b_1)_k ... (b_q)_k ) * z^k / k! ]

Where (a)_k is the Pochhammer symbol.

Looking at our sum:

Each term is 2^{2k} / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ]

Let me write this as:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Hmm, this can be written as:

4^k / [ (k! (k + 1)! ) (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ) ]

But I need to see if this can be expressed in terms of Pochhammer symbols.

Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! )

So:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)(2k)! ) ) ] = 4^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

But this still doesn't look familiar. Maybe we can express the terms in terms of (2k) coefficients.

Alternatively, let's consider writing (2k)! = 2^{2k} k! (k)! / (2k choose k) )

Wait, no. Wait, (2k)! = 2^{2k} k! (k)! * something. Let me recall that:

(2k)! = 2^{2k} k!^2 / (sqrt(π) Γ(k + 1/2) )

But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, note that (2k)! = (k! )^2 * 2^{2k} / (sqrt(π k) ) asymptotically, but that's for large k.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the term as:

4^k / [ (k! (k + 1)! ) (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ) ] = 4^k / [ (k! (k + 1)! ) (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ) ]

Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of the Pochhammer symbols.

Let's write out the terms for k=0,1,2 to see if a pattern emerges.

For k=0:

Term = 4^0 / [0! 1! 1! 1 ] = 1 / (1 * 1 * 1 * 1) = 1

For k=1:

4^1 / [1! 2! 3! 3 ] = 4 / (1 * 2 * 6 * 3) = 4 / 36) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111...

For k=2:

4^2 / [2! 3! 5! 5 ] = 16 / (2 * 6 * 120 * 5) = 16 / (7200) = 16/7200 = 1/450 ≈ 0.002222...

For k=3:

4^3 / [6 * 24 * 7! * 7 ] = 64 / (6 * 24 * 5040 * 7) = 64 / (6*24*5040*49) which is very small.

So the series starts with 1 + 1/9 + 1/450 + ... which seems to converge to something around 1.12 or so. But I need to find a closed-form expression.

Alternatively, perhaps this sum can be related to a hypergeometric function. Let's try to express it as such.

The general term of the sum is:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

Let me write this as:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

= (4^k) / [ (k + 1) k!^2 (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

= (4^k) / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

But I'm not sure. Let's see if we can write this in terms of Pochhammer symbols.

The Pochhammer symbol (a)_k = a(a + 1)...(a + k - 1)

For example, (1)_k = k!

But in our case, the denominator has (k + 1)! = (2)_{k} * 1, but not sure.

Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k )

Wait, using the relation:

(1/2)_k = (2k)! / (4^k k! )

Yes, because (1/2)_k = (1/2)(3/2)...( (2k - 1)/2 ) = (2k)! / (4^k k! )

Therefore, (2k)! = 4^k k! (1/2)_k

Similarly, (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! = (2k + 1) 4^k k! (1/2)_k

So substituting into the denominator:

(2k + 1)! = (2k + 1) 4^k k! (1/2)_k

Therefore, the term becomes:

4^k / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1) 4^k k! (1/2)_k (2k + 1) ) ]

Simplify:

4^k cancels with 4^k.

Denominator: (k + 1) (k! )^3 (2k + 1)^2 (1/2)_k )

So:

1 / [ (k + 1) (k! )^3 (2k + 1)^2 (1/2)_k ) ]

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the sum in terms of a hypergeometric function with appropriate parameters.

Let me recall that the modified Bessel function I₁(z) has a series expansion, and we already used that. But the integral we're computing is the original integral, which involves I₁(2x), and after expanding, we ended up with this sum. Maybe there's a different approach to compute the original integral without expanding the Bessel function.

Let me think. The original integral is ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx.

Another approach: perhaps express arccos(x) as an integral. We know that arccos(x) = ∫_x^1 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

So substituting this into the integral:

∫₀¹ [ ∫_x^1 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt ] (1/x) I₁(2x) dx

Then interchange the order of integration. The region is 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, x ≤ t ≤ 1. So changing the order, t ranges from 0 to 1, and x ranges from 0 to t.

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ [ ∫_0^t (1/x) I₁(2x) dx ] 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt

So now we need to compute the inner integral ∫_0^t (1/x) I₁(2x) dx.

But I₁(2x) / x = (1/x) * I₁(2x). Let's recall that the integral of I₁(ax)/x dx might have a known form.

Recall that the integral of I₀(ax) dx = (1/a) I₁(ax) + C. But here we have I₁(2x)/x.

Alternatively, let's recall the generating function or integral formulas for Bessel functions.

Alternatively, note that I₁(2x) can be expressed as a series, which we did before. Let's use the series expansion again.

I₁(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (x^{2k + 1} ) / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

Therefore, I₁(2x)/x = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So integrating from 0 to t:

∫_0^t I₁(2x)/x dx = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ ∫_0^t x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) dx ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ t^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1) k! (k + 1)! ) ]

Therefore, the inner integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ t^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1) k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So the original integral becomes:

∫₀¹ [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ t^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1) k! (k + 1)! ) ] * 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt

Interchange sum and integral (assuming convergence):

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / ( (2k + 1) k! (k + 1)! ) ] ∫₀¹ t^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt

This integral is similar to the one we did before. Let's compute it.

Let me make substitution u = t². Then du = 2t dt, so t dt = du/2. But the integral is t^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt = t^{2k} * t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

Let u = t², then t = 2u^{1/2} du, but perhaps a better substitution is u = t², so t = sqrt(u), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

Then:

∫₀¹ t^{2k + 1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt = ∫₀¹ u^{k} * sqrt(u) / sqrt(1 - u) * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du

Simplify:

∫₀¹ u^{k} / sqrt(1 - u) * (1/2) du = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{k} (1 - u)^{-1/2} du

Which is (1/2) B(k + 1, 1/2) = (1/2) Γ(k + 1)Γ(1/2)/Γ(k + 1 + 1/2)

As before, this is (1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2)

Which we already computed earlier as 2^{2k} (k! )² / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) )

But let's use the Beta function expression:

(1/2) B(k + 1, 1/2) = (1/2) * (k! sqrt(π) ) / Γ(k + 3/2)

So substituting back into the sum:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / ( (2k + 1) k! (k + 1)! ) ] * (1/2) * k! sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2)

Simplify:

The k! cancels:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / ( (2k + 1) (k + 1)! ) ] * (1/2) sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2)

But Γ(k + 3/2) can be expressed as (sqrt(π)/2^{2k + 1}) ) * (2k + 2)! ) / ( (k + 1)! )

Wait, using the duplication formula again:

Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ( (k + 1) + 1/2 ) = (2k + 2)! sqrt(π) ) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) )

So substituting:

sqrt(π) / Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π) / [ (2k + 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ) ] = 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2k + 2)! )

Therefore, the term becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / ( (2k + 1) (k + 1)! ) ] * (1/2) * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2k + 2)! )

Simplify:

(k + 1)! cancels:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (2k + 1) ] * (1/2) * 4^{k + 1} / (2k + 2)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k + 1} / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k} * 4 / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

= 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

Hmm, this seems like a different expression, but still not obviously familiar. Let's see if we can reindex the sum.

Let me set m = k + 1. Then when k=0, m=1, but that complicates the sum. Alternatively, perhaps express 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1), so 2k + 2! = (2(k + 1))!.

So:

2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2(k + 1))! ) ]

= 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this sum can be related to the series expansion of a known function.

Alternatively, perhaps we can recognize that 2(k + 1) = 2k + 2, so (2k + 2)! = (2(k + 1))! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! (2k + 1)!! )

But this might not help.

Alternatively, note that 4^k = 2^{2k}, and (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

So:

4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) = 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) )

= 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)^2 (2k + 2) (2k)! ) )

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this sum in terms of the modified Bessel functions again. Let me recall that:

I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! )

But our sum involves terms like 4^k / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! )

Alternatively, perhaps differentiate or integrate the Bessel function series.

Alternatively, consider that the sum we have is:

2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

Let me write 4^k = (2^2)^k = 2^{2k}, and (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

So:

2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k)! ) )

= 2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k)! ) )

= 1 / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2) ) * 2^{2k} / (2k)! )

But 2^{2k} / (2k)! ) is part of the series for cosh(2) or sinh(2), but with additional terms.

Alternatively, note that Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k} / (2k)! ) = cosh(z)

But here we have Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k)! ) )

Hmm, integrating or differentiating the series for cosh(z) might help.

Let me consider integrating cosh(z):

∫ cosh(z) dz = sinh(z) + C

But perhaps integrating term-by-term:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ ∫ z^{2k} / (2k)! dz = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k)! ) )

But our sum has an additional factor of 1/(2k + 2). So integrating again:

∫ Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k + 1} / ( (2k + 1)(2k)! ) dz = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k + 2} / ( (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) )

Which is similar to our sum if z=2.

So, if we set z=2, then:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k + 2} / ( (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^{k + 1} / ( (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) )

But our sum is 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) )

Note that (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! )

So:

4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) = 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) )

= 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)^2 (2k + 2)(2k)! ) )

But this seems different from the previous expression.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection to the integral of the Bessel function.

Alternatively, let's consider that the original integral might have a closed-form expression in terms of known constants or functions. Let me check integral tables or resources.

After some research, I find that integrals involving arccos(x) and Bessel functions are not common, but perhaps there's a relation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of the Bessel function. The modified Bessel function I₁(2x) can be represented as:

I₁(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ

But substituting this into the original integral:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx = (1/π) ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ dx

Interchange the order of integration:

= (1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ

But this seems complicated. However, perhaps integrating over x first.

Let me consider the inner integral ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx.

Again, integrating by parts. Let u = arccos(x), dv = (1/x) e^{2x cosθ} dx.

Then du = -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v = ∫ (1/x) e^{2x cosθ} dx. But integrating (1/x) e^{2x cosθ} dx is not straightforward. It might relate to the exponential integral function, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, expand e^{2x cosθ} into its Taylor series:

e^{2x cosθ} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n x^n / n!

Then the inner integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n x^n / n! dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n / n! ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{n - 1} dx

But this brings us back to the integral of arccos(x) x^{n - 1} dx, which for n=0 would be problematic, but n starts at 0, so x^{-1} which is divergent. However, the original integral has 1/x, so when n=0, we have x^{-1} * arccos(x) which is also divergent at x=0. Therefore, this approach might not be valid.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the original integral is convergent. As x approaches 0, arccos(x) approaches π/2, and I₁(2x) ~ x, so the integrand behaves like (1/x) * π/2 * x = π/2, which is finite. Therefore, the integral is convergent.

But integrating term-by-term might not be valid due to the singularity at x=0. Therefore, perhaps the series approach we did earlier is the way to go, even if the sum seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the sum numerically. Since the terms decrease rapidly, we can approximate the sum by computing the first few terms.

Let's compute the sum:

The original integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ] * [1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, going back to the original sum after computing the integral:

The original integral after expanding I₁(2x) and integrating term-by-term is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [2^{2k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ]

So each term is:

2^{2k} / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ]

Let's compute the first few terms:

For k=0:

2^{0} / [0! 1! 1 * 1! ] = 1 / (1 * 1 * 1 * 1) = 1

For k=1:

2^{2} / [1! 2! 3 * 3! ] = 4 / (1 * 2 * 3 * 6) = 4 / 36 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111111111

For k=2:

2^{4} / [2! 3! 5 * 5! ] = 16 / (2 * 6 * 5 * 120) = 16 / (7200) = 0.0022222222

For k=3:

2^{6} / [6 * 24 * 7 * 5040 ] = 64 / (6 * 24 * 7 * 5040 ) = 64 / (6*24*7*5040) = 64 / (5080320) ≈ 0.0000126

For k=4:

2^{8} / [24 * 120 * 9 * 40320 ] = 256 / (24 * 120 * 9 * 40320 ) = 256 / (1254113280) ≈ 2.04e-7

So the terms are decreasing rapidly. Adding up the first few terms:

k=0: 1

k=1: + 0.1111111111 ≈ 1.1111111111

k=2: + 0.0022222222 ≈ 1.1133333333

k=3: + 0.0000126 ≈ 1.1133459333

k=4: + 2.04e-7 ≈ 1.1133461373

Higher terms contribute negligibly. So the sum converges to approximately 1.1133461373.

But let's check with more precision. Let's compute k=0 to k=4:

k=0: 1

k=1: 4 / (1! * 2! * 3 * 3! ) = 4 / (1*2*3*6) = 4/36 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111111111111111

k=2: 16 / (2! * 3! * 5 * 5! ) = 16 / (2*6*5*120) = 16 / 7200 = 0.0022222222222222222

k=3: 64 / (6 * 24 * 7 * 5040 ) = 64 / (6*24*7*5040) = 64 / 5080320 ≈ 0.00001259920634920635

k=4: 256 / (24 * 120 * 9 * 40320 ) = 256 / (24*120*9*40320) = 256 / (1254113280) ≈ 2.041282905959664e-7

k=5: 1024 / (120 * 720 * 11 * 362880 ) = 1024 / (120*720*11*362880) = 1024 / (345664512000) ≈ 2.962310714e-9

So adding these:

1 + 0.1111111111 = 1.1111111111

+ 0.0022222222 = 1.1133333333

+ 0.0000125992 = 1.1133459325

+ 0.0000002041 = 1.1133461366

+ 0.00000000296 = 1.1133461395

So up to k=5, the sum is approximately 1.1133461395. The higher terms contribute less than 1e-9, so we can approximate the sum as approximately 1.1133461395.

Therefore, the value of the integral is approximately 1.1133461395.

But let's check this with a numerical integration. Let's compute the original integral numerically to verify.

Using numerical integration methods, such as adaptive quadrature, we can approximate the integral ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx.

But since I don't have a calculator here, but given that the series converges to approximately 1.113346, and the terms beyond k=5 are negligible, this is likely the correct value.

Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as the infinite sum:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{2k} ] / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ]

But this sum doesn't seem to have a known closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions. However, in some references, this sum might be expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions, but I need to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be expressed in terms of known constants. However, given the time I've spent and the lack of obvious simplification, I think the answer is this sum, which evaluates numerically to approximately 1.1133461395.

But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If there's no known closed-form, then the sum is the exact answer, but perhaps there's a closed-form that I'm missing.

Wait, let me think again. The original integral is ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx.

Let me consider substituting t = arccos(x). Then x = cos(t), dx = -sin(t) dt. When x=0, t=π/2; x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes:

∫_{π/2}^0 (1/cos(t)) * t * I₁(2 cos(t)) * (-sin(t) dt) = ∫₀^{π/2} t / cos(t) * I₁(2 cos(t)) sin(t) dt

= ∫₀^{π/2} t * tan(t) * I₁(2 cos(t)) dt

Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps express I₁(2 cos(t)) in terms of its series:

I₁(2 cos(t)) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2 cos(t))^{2k + 1} / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! ) )

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] dt

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] ∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) cos(t)^{2k + 1} dt

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt

Because tan(t) = sin(t)/cos(t), so tan(t) cos(t)^{2k + 1} = sin(t) cos(t)^{2k}

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt

This integral ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt might have a known form.

Let me consider integrating by parts. Let u = t, dv = sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt.

Then du = dt, and v = -cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)

Wait, let's compute v:

dv = sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt

Let u = cos(t), then du = -sin(t) dt

So dv = -u^{2k} du

Therefore, v = - ∫ u^{2k} du = - u^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) + C = - cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) + C

Therefore, integration by parts gives:

uv | from 0 to π/2 - ∫₀^{π/2} v du

= [ -t cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) ] from 0 to π/2 + ∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1) dt

At t=π/2, cos(π/2) = 0, so the first term is 0. At t=0, cos(0) = 1, but t=0, so the term is 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

1/(2k + 1) ∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{2k + 1} dt

So the integral ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt = 1/(2k + 1) ∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{2k + 1} dt

The integral ∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{2k + 1} dt is a known Beta function integral. Specifically:

∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{n} dt = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ( (n + 1)/2 ) / Γ( (n + 2)/2 )

For n = 2k + 1:

∫₀^{π/2} cos(t)^{2k + 1} dt = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 1) / Γ(k + 3/2 )

Therefore, substituting back:

∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{2k} dt = 1/(2k + 1) * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 1) / Γ(k + 3/2 )

= sqrt(π)/(2(2k + 1)) * k! / Γ(k + 3/2 )

But Γ(k + 3/2) can be expressed using the duplication formula as before:

Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Therefore, substituting:

sqrt(π)/(2(2k + 1)) * k! / [ (2k + 2)! sqrt(π) / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ) ]

= sqrt(π)/(2(2k + 1)) * k! * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / ( (2k + 2)! sqrt(π) )

The sqrt(π) cancels:

= 1/(2(2k + 1)) * k! * 4^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (2k + 2)! )

= 4^{k + 1} k! (k + 1)! / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 2)! )

= 4^{k} * 4 * k! (k + 1)! / (2(2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)! )

= 4^{k} * 2 * k! (k + 1)! / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)! )

But (2k + 2)(2k + 1)! = (2k + 2)! )

So:

= 2 * 4^{k} k! (k + 1)! / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! )

= 2 * 4^{k} k! (k + 1)! / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)! )

But this seems similar to previous expressions. However, substituting back into the sum:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ 2 * 4^{k} k! (k + 1)! / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

Simplify:

The k! and (k + 1)! cancel with the denominator:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2 * 4^{k} / ( (2k + 1)(2k + 2)! ) ]

Which is the same sum as before, multiplied by 2. Wait, no:

Wait, the expression after substituting back into the sum is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ sqrt(π)/(2(2k + 1)) * k! / Γ(k + 3/2 ) ]

But we already did this and ended up with the same sum. So this approach also leads back to the same sum.

Therefore, it seems that the exact answer is indeed this infinite series, which sums to approximately 1.113346139. However, the problem asks for the exact answer. If there's no known closed-form, then we have to present the series as the exact answer, but I suspect that there might be a closed-form involving known constants or functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function or hypergeometric functions, but I'm not sure. Let me consider hypergeometric functions.

The sum we have is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{2k} ] / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ]

Let me write this as:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (4)^k ] / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

This can be written as:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (4)^k / [ (k! (k + 1)! ) (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ]

This resembles a hypergeometric function of several variables, but it's not a standard one. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function _pF_q.

The generalized hypergeometric function is defined as:

_pF_q(a_1, ..., a_p; b_1, ..., b_q; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (a_1)_k ... (a_p)_k / (b_1)_k ... (b_q)_k ) z^k / k! ]

In our case, the term is:

(4)^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Let's express this as:

(4)^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

= 4^k / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1) (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

But this doesn't directly fit into the hypergeometric function's structure. Alternatively, perhaps write it as:

(4^k) / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1) (2k + 1)! (2k + 1) ]

= 4^k / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1) (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! )

But I don't see a straightforward way to express this in terms of Pochhammer symbols. Therefore, it's possible that this sum doesn't have a closed-form expression in terms of standard special functions, and the exact answer is the infinite sum itself.

However, given that the problem asks for the exact answer, and given that the numerical approximation is approximately 1.113346139, I might need to check if this number corresponds to a known constant or a simple expression.

Let me compute the numerical value to higher precision. Using the terms up to k=5, we have approximately 1.1133461395. Let's compute more terms:

k=5: 2.962310714e-9

k=6: 2^{12} / (6! * 7! * 13 * 13! ) = 4096 / (720 * 5040 * 13 * 6227020800 ) = 4096 / (720*5040*13*6227020800) which is extremely small, around 1.4e-11.

So the sum is approximately 1.1133461395 + negligible terms.

Checking this number in the Inverse Symbolic Calculator (ISC) or mathematical constants databases might help, but since I can't access that here, I'll assume that there's no simple closed-form and the exact answer is the series.

However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If there's no known closed-form, then the answer is expressed as the sum. But perhaps there's a clever substitution or identity I'm missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be related to the integral of a product of Bessel functions and trigonometric functions. Alternatively, consider that arccos(x) can be expressed as an integral, and then interchange the order of integration.

But given the time I've spent and the lack of progress towards a closed-form, I think the answer is the infinite series we derived, which evaluates numerically to approximately 1.1133461395.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact answer: Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{2k} ] / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1)(2k + 1)! ]

Numerical approximation: approximately 1.1133461395

But the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX and the numerical approximation. Since the exact answer is an infinite series, I need to present it in LaTeX. However, if there's a known closed-form, I must have missed it. Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to π/2 times something.

Wait, let me check the numerical value. 1.1133461395. Is this equal to π/2? π/2 ≈ 1.5708. No. Is it π²/8? π²/8 ≈ 1.2337. No. Is it related to Catalan's constant? Which is approximately 0.915965594. No. Maybe e? e ≈ 2.718. No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the modified Struve function. The modified Struve function L₁(z) has a series expansion involving terms similar to Bessel functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, recall that the integral of arccos(x) can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed as a combination of Bessel functions. But I don't see a direct relation.

Given that I can't find a closed-form, I'll have to present the exact answer as the infinite series and the numerical approximation as approximately 1.1133461395.

But the problem says to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer, so perhaps there's a closed-form that I missed. Let me think again.

Wait, going back to the original integral:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx

Let me consider the integral representation of I₁(2x):

I₁(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ

Substituting this into the integral:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) * (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ dx

= (1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ

Interchange the order of integration:

= (1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ

Let me focus on the inner integral:

∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) e^{2x cosθ} dx

Let me make substitution t = arccos(x), so x = cos(t), dx = -sin(t) dt. When x=0, t=π/2; x=1, t=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫_{π/2}^0 (1/cos(t)) * t * e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} (-sin(t) dt)

= ∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} dt

So the inner integral is ∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} dt

This seems complicated, but perhaps integrating by parts. Let u = t, dv = tan(t) e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} dt

But this seems difficult. Alternatively, expand e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} into its Taylor series:

e^{2 cos(t) cosθ} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n cos(t)^n / n!

Then the inner integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n / n! ∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) cos(t)^n dt

But tan(t) cos(t)^n = sin(t) cos(t)^{n - 1}

So:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2 cosθ)^n / n! ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{n - 1} dt

But for n=0, this integral is ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(t) cos(t)^{-1} dt = ∫₀^{π/2} t tan(t) dt, which diverges. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Therefore, perhaps the original approach of expanding I₁(2x) into a series and integrating term-by-term is the only viable method, leading to the infinite series.

Given that, I'll conclude that the exact answer is the infinite series and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1133461395.

But the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX. Since the series is complicated, perhaps it can be expressed using hypergeometric functions. Let me try to express the sum as a hypergeometric function.

The general term of the sum is:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Let me write this as:

(4^k) / [ (k + 1) k!^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

But I need to express this in terms of Pochhammer symbols. Let's see:

The term can be written as:

4^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

= 4^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

= 4^k / [ (k + 1) k!^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

= 4^k / [ (k + 1) k!^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Let me express this as:

(4^k) / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

= (4^k) / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

This can be written as:

(4^k) / [ (1)_{k+1} (1)_k (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)! = 2^{2k} k! ) (1/2)_k )

But this might not help.

Alternatively, using the Pochhammer symbols:

(2k + 1)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k )

But (1/2)_k = (2k)! / (4^k k! )

So (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1) (2k)! = (2k + 1) 4^k k! (1/2)_k )

Therefore, substituting:

(4^k) / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ]

= 4^k / [ (k + 1) (k! )^2 (2k + 1) (2k + 1) 4^k k! (1/2)_k ) ]

= 1 / [ (k + 1) (k! )^3 (2k + 1)^2 (1/2)_k ) ]

This seems even more complicated. Therefore, I think it's best to present the exact answer as the infinite series and provide the numerical approximation.

Thus, the final answer is:

Exact answer: Σ_{k=0}^∞ \frac{2^{2k}}{k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)!}

Numerical approximation: approximately 1.1133461395

But the problem requires the exact answer in LaTeX. So the exact answer in LaTeX is the sum from k=0 to infinity of 2^{2k} divided by [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ].

Therefore, the JSON answer would be:

{"answer": "\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^{2k}}{k! \\, (k+1)! \\, (2k+1) \\, (2k+1)!}", "numerical_answer": "1.1133461395"}

But before finalizing, let me check if there's a known closed-form. After some research, I found that this integral can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function. Specifically, the integral can be written as:

π/2 * _3F_4(1/2, 1, 1; 3/2, 3/2, 2, 2; 1)

But I need to verify this.

The hypergeometric function _3F_4 is defined as:

_3F_4(a_1, a_2, a_3; b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (a_1)_k (a_2)_k (a_3)_k / (b_1)_k (b_2)_k (b_3)_k (b_4)_k ) z^k / k! ]

Comparing with our sum:

Our term is:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Let me express this as:

(4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ] = (4^k) / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) (2k + 1)! ]

Let me write (k + 1)! = (1)_{k+1} = (1)_k (k + 1)

Similarly, (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! = (2k + 1) (2)^2k (k! )^2 (1/2)_k / sqrt(π) )

But this might not help.

Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k )

So:

(2k + 1)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k )

Therefore, the term becomes:

4^k / [k! (k + 1)! (2k + 1) 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k ) ]

= 4^k / [k! (k + 1) k! (2k + 1) 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k ) ]

= 4^k / [ (k! )^3 (k + 1) (2k + 1) 2^{2k} (1/2)_k ) ]

= (4/4)^k / [ (k! )^3 (k + 1) (2k + 1) (1/2)_k ) ]

= 1 / [ (k! )^3 (k + 1) (2k + 1) (1/2)_k ) ]

This still doesn't match the hypergeometric function's parameters. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the exact answer is the infinite series as written, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1133461395.
