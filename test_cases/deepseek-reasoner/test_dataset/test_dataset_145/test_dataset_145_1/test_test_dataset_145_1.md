Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x) * arccos(x) * I₁(2x) dx. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I₁ is. I₁ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 1. I remember that Bessel functions often come up in problems with cylindrical symmetry, but I'm not sure how that helps here. 

First step is to understand the integrand: (arccos x)/x multiplied by I₁(2x). The arccos function complicates things a bit. Maybe I can expand one of the functions into a series and integrate term by term. Let me think about series expansions for arccos and I₁.

The modified Bessel function I₁(2x) has a series expansion. Let me recall that the general form for I_n(z) is the sum from k=0 to infinity of (z/2)^{2k + n} / [k! (k + n)!]. So for I₁(2x), substituting z = 2x and n=1, we get:

I₁(2x) = Σ [ (2x/2)^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] from k=0 to ∞
= Σ [ x^{2k + 1} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So that's x times Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So I₁(2x) = x Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

Now, the integrand is (arccos x)/x * I₁(2x) = (arccos x)/x * x Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] = arccos x * Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ arccos(x) * Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] dx

If I can interchange the sum and the integral, then it becomes Σ [1/(k! (k + 1)! ) ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx ]

So now the problem reduces to computing each integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx and then summing over k.

Let me check if interchanging sum and integral is valid. Since the series for I₁(2x) converges uniformly on [0,1], I think it's okay to interchange.

Now, let's focus on ∫ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx. Maybe integration by parts? Let u = arccos(x), dv = x^{2k} dx.

Then du = -1 / sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v = x^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1)

Integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du.

So [arccos(x) * x^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1)] from 0 to 1 minus ∫₀¹ [x^{2k + 1}/(2k + 1)] * (-1)/sqrt(1 - x²) dx

Evaluating the boundary term: at x=1, arccos(1) = 0, so that term is 0. At x=0, x^{2k +1} is 0, so the entire boundary term is 0. So the integral becomes (1/(2k +1)) ∫₀¹ x^{2k +1}/sqrt(1 - x²) dx

So now we have to compute ∫₀¹ x^{2k +1}/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let me make a substitution. Let t = x², so dt = 2x dx, but maybe another substitution. Let me set t = x², then x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Wait, but the integral is x^{2k +1}/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let's substitute x = sinθ, which might be helpful because sqrt(1 - x²) becomes cosθ. Let's try that.

Let x = sinθ, so dx = cosθ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k +1} / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k +1} dθ

That's a standard integral. The integral of sin^{n}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is given by (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n +1)/2)/Γ((n +2)/2). For n = 2k +1, which is odd. Alternatively, there's a formula for the beta function. The integral ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{m}θ dθ = (1/2) B((m +1)/2, 1/2) = (1/2) Γ((m +1)/2) Γ(1/2)/Γ((m +2)/2)/2). Wait, maybe better to recall that for integer m, ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ = (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! ) * π/2? Wait, no. Wait, for even exponents, we have the double factorial formula, but for odd exponents:

Wait, for example, ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ = (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

Wait, let me check for k=0: ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to π/2 is 1. (2*0)!! = 1, (2*0 +1)!! =1, so 1/1 =1. Correct. For k=1: ∫ sin^3θ dθ = 2/3. (2*1)!! =2, (2*1 +1)!!=3, so 2/3. Correct. So yes, the formula is ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ = (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

Therefore, the integral becomes (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

So putting it all together, the original integral after integration by parts is (1/(2k +1)) * (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

But we can simplify this. Let's note that (2k)!! = 2^k k! and (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! )

Wait, let me recall that (2k)!! = 2^k * k! and (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! )

So substituting these:

(2k)!! / (2k +1)!! = (2^k k! ) / [ (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ] = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (1/(2k +1)) * (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Simplify denominator: (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! )

So this becomes (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / [ (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Therefore, the integral is (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / [ (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

So now, going back to the original sum:

The original integral is Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) * (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ] from k=0 to ∞

Simplify term by term:

1/(k! (k +1)! ) * (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) = [2^{2k} k! ] / [ (k +1)! (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Simplify k! / (k +1)! = 1/(k +1)

So this becomes 2^{2k} / [ (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Therefore, the sum is Σ [ 2^{2k} / ( (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ] from k=0 to ∞

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this sum. Alternatively, perhaps there's a known series representation for this sum. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate this to hypergeometric functions. The modified Bessel function I₁(2x) can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let me recall that I₁(z) = (z/2) Σ [ (z^2/4)^k / (k! (k +1)! ) ] which is similar to the series we have.

But perhaps integrating term by term is not leading us anywhere. Let me check if there's a known integral involving arccos and Bessel functions. Alternatively, maybe using integral transforms or differentiation under the integral sign.

Alternatively, perhaps changing the order of integration. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, arccos(x) can be expressed as an integral. arccos(x) = ∫ₓ¹ 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. So maybe we can write the original integral as ∫₀¹ (1/x) I₁(2x) [ ∫ₓ¹ 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt ] dx

Then switching the order of integration. The region is x from 0 to1 and t from x to1. So switching, t goes from 0 to1, and x goes from0 to t. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀ᵗ (1/x) I₁(2x) dx ] / sqrt(1 - t²) dt

So now we have to compute ∫₀ᵗ (1/x) I₁(2x) dx and then integrate that with respect to t over [0,1], divided by sqrt(1 - t²).

But integrating (1/x) I₁(2x) dx. Let me recall that the integral of I₁(ax)/x dx might have a known form. Let me check.

The modified Bessel function I₁(ax) has an integral representation. Alternatively, perhaps using the series expansion again. Let's expand I₁(2x)/x:

I₁(2x)/x = Σ [x^{2k} / (k! (k +1)! ) ] from k=0 to ∞

So integrating term by term from 0 to t:

∫₀ᵗ I₁(2x)/x dx = Σ [ ∫₀ᵗ x^{2k} / (k! (k +1)! ) dx ] = Σ [ t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) ]

So the inner integral becomes Σ [ t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) ]

Therefore, the original integral becomes ∫₀¹ [ Σ [ t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) ] / sqrt(1 - t²) ] dt

Interchange sum and integral again (if valid):

Σ [ 1 / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) ∫₀¹ t^{2k +1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt ]

Now, compute ∫₀¹ t^{2k +1} / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Let me use substitution u = t², so du = 2t dt, but maybe another substitution. Let u = 1 - t², then du = -2t dt. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, set t = sinθ, similar to before. Let t = sinθ, dt = cosθ dθ, sqrt(1 - t²) = cosθ. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k +1}θ dθ, which we already know is (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

So this integral is (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! )

So substituting back into the sum:

Σ [ 1 / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) * (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! ) ]

Again, using the expressions for double factorials:

(2k)!! = 2^k k! and (2k +1)!! = (2k +1)! / (2^k k! )

So (2k)!! / (2k +1)!! = (2^k k! ) / [ (2k +1)! / (2^k k! ) ] = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / (2k +1)! )

Therefore, the term becomes [1 / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ) ] * [2^{2k} (k! )^2 / (2k +1)! ) ] = [2^{2k} (k! )^2 ] / [ (2k +1) k! (k +1)! (2k +1)! ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= 2^{2k} k! / [ (2k +1) (k +1)! (2k +1)! ) ]

Note that (k +1)! = (k +1) k!, so:

= 2^{2k} k! / [ (2k +1) (k +1) k! (2k +1)! ) ] = 2^{2k} / [ (2k +1)(k +1)(2k +1)! ) ]

So the sum is Σ [ 2^{2k} / ( (2k +1)(k +1)(2k +1)! ) ) ] from k=0 to ∞

This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a generating function or a known series that matches this. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that this sum can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions.

Alternatively, let's compute the numerical value first and see if it matches a known constant. Let's try to compute the sum numerically for several terms and see if it converges.

Let me compute the first few terms:

For k=0:

Term = 2^{0} / (1 *1 *1! ) = 1 / (1*1*1) =1

k=1:

2^{2} / (3*2*3! ) =4 / (3*2*6 )=4/(36)=1/9≈0.111111

k=2:

2^{4}/(5*3*5! )=16/(5*3*120)=16/(1800)=4/450≈0.008888...

k=3:

2^6/(7*4*7! )=64/(7*4*5040)=64/(141120)=≈0.0004535

k=4:

2^8/(9*5*40320)=256/(9*5*40320)=256/1814400≈0.000141

So summing these terms:

1 + 0.111111 +0.008888 +0.0004535 +0.000141 ≈1.1205935

The terms are getting smaller quickly, so maybe the sum converges to around 1.1206. But let's check more terms.

k=5:

2^{10}/(11*6*11! )=1024/(11*6*39916800)=1024/(2634508800)≈0.000000388

So adding this gives ≈1.1205939

So it seems the sum converges to approximately 1.1206. But wait, the original integral is this sum. But wait, the original integral is from 0 to1 of (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx. But according to the steps, after switching integrals and substituting, we arrived at this sum which is approximately 1.1206. But let's check with numerical integration.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form expression. Let me think if this sum can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. Let me recall that the generating function for the modified Bessel function is e^{(z/2)(t +1/t)} = Σ_{k=-∞}^∞ I_k(z) t^k. But not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe the sum can be related to a hypergeometric function. Let's see. The general term is 2^{2k} / [ (2k +1)(k +1)(2k +1)! ) ]

Let me write 2^{2k} as 4^k. So term is 4^k / [ (2k +1)(k +1)(2k +1)! )

Let me write (2k +1)! = (2k +1)(2k)! )

So term becomes 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! )

But (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...1. Hmm.

Alternatively, express in terms of factorials:

(2k)! = 2^k k! (2k -1)!! )

But not sure. Alternatively, write the term as 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

Let me see if this can be expressed as a hypergeometric function. The hypergeometric function is Σ [ (a)_n (b)_n / (c)_n ] z^n /n! )

But our term is 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

Let me try to manipulate it. Let's write (2k +1)^2 = (2k +1)(2k +1), and (k +1) = (k +1). So denominator is (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! )

Let me express (2k)! as 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k / 1, using the duplication formula. Wait, the duplication formula is Γ(z)Γ(z +1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). Not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps express the term in terms of Pochhammer symbols. Let me note that (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...1. But I don't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, let's consider the term as:

4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ] = (4^k / (2k)! ) * 1 / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ]

But 4^k / (2k)! ) is similar to the series expansion of cosh(2) or something, but with denominators (2k)!.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions again. Let me recall that I₁(2x) has a series involving x^{2k +1}/(k! (k +1)! ), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is related to the integral of a Bessel function. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of the Bessel function. I₁(2x) can be written as (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe integrating term by term and recognizing the sum. Let's see:

The sum is Σ [4^k / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

Let me write 4^k = 2^{2k}, and (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...1. Let's see if we can write this in terms of the Beta function or Gamma function.

Let me note that (2k)! = Γ(2k +1), and (k +1) = Γ(k +2)/Γ(k +1). But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the term as:

4^k / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) = (4^k / (2k)! ) * 1 / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ]

But 4^k / (2k)! is the term for cosh(2) or similar functions. For example, cosh(2) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2)^{2k}/(2k)! ) = Σ 4^k/(2k)! )

But our term has an extra 1/[ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ]

Hmm. This seems too complicated. Maybe the sum doesn't have a closed-form expression, and we need to evaluate it numerically. But the problem says to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. So there must be a closed-form.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me double-check.

Original integral: ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx

We expanded I₁(2x) as Σ [x^{2k +1}/(k! (k +1)! ) ]

Then the integrand becomes arccos(x) Σ [x^{2k}/(k! (k +1)! ) ]

Then interchanged sum and integral, leading to Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx ]

Then integrated by parts, leading to Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) * (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ]

Then simplified to Σ [2^{2k} / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the simplification steps. Let me check:

After integration by parts, we had:

∫₀¹ arccos(x) x^{2k} dx = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / [ (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Then the term in the sum is [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ] * [ (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ]

= [2^{2k} k! ] / [ (k +1)! (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

= [2^{2k} ] / [ (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ]

Yes, that's correct.

So the sum is Σ [2^{2k} / ( (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ]

Hmm. Let me try to write this as Σ [ (4^k) / ( (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ]

Let me shift the index. Let n = k +1. Then k = n -1, so when k=0, n=1. So the sum becomes Σ_{n=1}^∞ [4^{n -1} / (n (2n -1)^2 (2(n -1))! ) ) ]

But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of (2k)! and see if there's a generating function.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating function techniques. Let me consider the generating function G(x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [4^k / ( (k +1) (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) ] x^k

But this seems too specific. Alternatively, maybe recognizing that the sum is related to a known integral or series.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of 1/(2k +1)^2. Recall that ∫₀¹ t^{2k} dt =1/(2k +1). But we have 1/(2k +1)^2, which is ∫₀¹ t^{2k} dt ∫₀¹ s^{2k} ds. So maybe:

1/(2k +1)^2 = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ t^{2k} s^{2k} dt ds

Then the sum becomes Σ [4^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ t^{2k} s^{2k} dt ds ]

= ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ Σ [ (4 t^2)^{k} / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] dt ds

Wait, but the exponent is t^{2k} s^{2k} = (ts)^{2k}, so 4^k (ts)^{2k} = (4 t² s²)^k

So the sum becomes ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ Σ [ (4 t² s²)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] dt ds

Let me change variables: let u = 4 t² s². Then the sum is Σ [ u^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

But this sum is Σ_{k=0}^∞ u^k / [ (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

Let me write this as (1/u) Σ_{k=0}^∞ u^{k +1} / [ (k +1) (2k)! ) ] = (1/u) Σ_{m=1}^∞ u^m / (m (2(m -1))! ) )

Where m =k +1. So this is (1/u) Σ_{m=1}^∞ u^m / (m (2m -2)! ) )

Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps express this in terms of known functions.

Alternatively, consider that Σ_{k=0}^\infty x^{2k}/(2k)! ) = cosh(x). But here we have Σ_{k=0}^\infty x^k/( (k +1) (2k)! ) )

Hmm. Let me try to write this sum as an integral. Since 1/(k +1) = ∫₀¹ t^k dt. So:

Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ u^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ ∫₀¹ t^k dt / (2k)! ) ] u^k = ∫₀¹ Σ_{k=0}^\infty (u t)^k / (2k)! ) dt

The sum inside is Σ_{k=0}^\infty (u t)^k / (2k)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^\infty (sqrt(u t))^{2k} / (2k)! ) = cosh( sqrt(u t) )

Therefore, the sum becomes ∫₀¹ cosh( sqrt(u t) ) dt

But u =4 t² s², so sqrt(u t) = sqrt(4 t² s² t) = sqrt(4 t^3 s²) = 2 t^{3/2} s

Wait, substituting back, the sum Σ [ (4 t² s²)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] = ∫₀¹ cosh(2 t^{3/2} s ) dt

Wait, no. Wait, we had:

Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (4 t² s²)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] = (1/(4 t² s²)) ∫₀¹ cosh(2 t s sqrt(v)) dv, where I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-express:

We had Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (u)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] = ∫₀¹ Σ_{k=0}^\infty (u t)^k / (2k)! ) dt = ∫₀¹ cosh( sqrt(u t) ) dt

Therefore, substituting u =4 t² s², we get:

Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (4 t² s²)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] = ∫₀¹ cosh( sqrt(4 t² s² * v) ) dv, where v is the integration variable from 0 to1.

Wait, no, the substitution was u t =4 t² s² * v? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Original sum S = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (4 t² s²)^k / ( (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

We used 1/(k +1) = ∫₀¹ v^k dv, so S = ∫₀¹ Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (4 t² s² v )^k / (2k)! ) ] dv

= ∫₀¹ cosh( sqrt(4 t² s² v ) ) dv

= ∫₀¹ cosh(2 t s sqrt(v) ) dv

Let me make a substitution w = sqrt(v), so dv = 2w dw, and when v=0, w=0; v=1, w=1.

Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ cosh(2 t s w ) * 2w dw

= 2 ∫₀¹ w cosh(2 t s w ) dw

Integrate by parts: let u = w, dv = cosh(2 t s w ) dw

Then du = dw, v = (1/(2 t s )) sinh(2 t s w )

So uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du = [ w/(2 t s ) sinh(2 t s w ) ]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (1/(2 t s )) sinh(2 t s w ) dw

= [1/(2 t s ) sinh(2 t s ) ] - [1/(2 t s ) * (1/(2 t s )) (cosh(2 t s w ))|₀¹ ]

= ( sinh(2 t s ) )/(2 t s ) - ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( (2 t s )^2 )

Therefore, the integral S becomes 2 [ sinh(2 t s )/(2 t s ) - ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( (2 t s )^2 ) ]

= sinh(2 t s )/( t s ) - ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( 2 t² s² )

So going back to the original expression, the sum inside the double integral is equal to this expression. Therefore, the original sum is:

∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ [ sinh(2 t s )/( t s ) - ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( 2 t² s² ) ] dt ds

This seems very complicated, but maybe simplifying.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Part A: ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ sinh(2 t s )/( t s ) dt ds

Part B: - ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( 2 t² s² ) dt ds

Let's handle Part A first:

Part A: ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ sinh(2 t s )/( t s ) dt ds

Let me make a substitution u = t s. Let me fix s and substitute u = t s, so t = u/s, dt = du/s. Then when t=0, u=0; t=1, u=s.

So Part A becomes ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^s sinh(2u)/( (u/s) s ) * du/s ) ] ds

Simplify:

= ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^s sinh(2u)/u * du/s * s ) ] ds

Wait, let's compute the inner integral:

Inside Part A, after substitution:

∫₀^s sinh(2u)/( (u/s) s ) * du/s = ∫₀^s sinh(2u)/(u) * du/s * s = ∫₀^s sinh(2u)/u du

So Part A becomes ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^s sinh(2u)/u du ] ds

Interchange the order of integration. The region is 0 ≤ u ≤ s ≤1. So changing order, u from 0 to1, s from u to1.

Thus, Part A = ∫₀¹ [ ∫_u^1 ds ] sinh(2u)/u du = ∫₀¹ (1 - u) sinh(2u)/u du

= ∫₀¹ (1 - u) sinh(2u)/u du

= ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/u du - ∫₀¹ sinh(2u) du

The first integral is ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/u du, which is a known integral related to the hyperbolic sine integral function. The second integral is straightforward.

∫ sinh(2u) du = (cosh(2u))/2 + C

So Part A = [ ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/u du ] - [ (cosh(2) -1)/2 ]

Similarly, the integral ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/u du is the hyperbolic sine integral evaluated at 2, which is Shi(2). The Shi function is defined as ∫₀^x sinh(t)/t dt. So Shi(2) = ∫₀² sinh(t)/t dt. Therefore, ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/u du = ∫₀² sinh(t)/t dt = Shi(2)

Therefore, Part A = Shi(2) - (cosh(2) -1)/2

Now, Part B: - ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( 2 t² s² ) dt ds

Let me make the same substitution u = t s. Then t = u/s, dt = du/s. The limits for t from 0 to1, s from0 to1. So u ranges from0 to s, but when s is from0 to1, u ranges from0 to1. Wait, no. For each s, t goes from0 to1, so u = t s goes from0 to s. Therefore, changing variables to u and s, but it's complicated. Alternatively, interchange the order of integration.

Part B = -1/2 ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ ( cosh(2 t s ) -1 )/( t² s² ) dt ds

Let me make substitution v = t s. Let me fix s and set v = t s, so t = v/s, dt = dv/s. Then when t=0, v=0; t=1, v=s.

So Part B becomes -1/2 ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^s ( cosh(2v) -1 )/( (v/s)^2 s² ) * dv/s ) ] ds

Simplify the integrand:

( cosh(2v) -1 )/( (v²/s²) s² ) * dv/s = ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² * dv/s

So Part B = -1/2 ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^s ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² dv ] (1/s) ds

Interchange the order of integration. The region is 0 ≤ v ≤ s ≤1. So v from0 to1, s from v to1.

Thus, Part B = -1/2 ∫₀¹ [ ∫_v^1 (1/s) ds ] ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² dv

= -1/2 ∫₀¹ [ ln v ] ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² dv

Wait, ∫_v^1 (1/s) ds = -ln v

So Part B = -1/2 ∫₀¹ ( -ln v ) ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² dv

= 1/2 ∫₀¹ (ln v ) ( cosh(2v) -1 )/v² dv

This integral seems complicated. Maybe integrating by parts. Let me set u = ln v, dv = (cosh(2v) -1)/v² dv

But this might not help. Alternatively, expand cosh(2v) -1 into its Taylor series.

cosh(2v) -1 = Σ_{n=1}^\infty ( (2v)^{2n} )/( (2n)! ) ) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty (4^n v^{2n} )/( (2n)! ) )

So (cosh(2v) -1)/v² = Σ_{n=1}^\infty (4^n v^{2n -2} )/( (2n)! ) )

Therefore, Part B becomes 1/2 ∫₀¹ ln v ) Σ_{n=1}^\infty (4^n v^{2n -2} )/( (2n)! ) ) dv

Interchange sum and integral:

= 1/2 Σ_{n=1}^\infty [4^n / (2n)! ) ∫₀¹ v^{2n -2} ln v dv ]

The integral ∫₀¹ v^{2n -2} ln v dv. Let me make substitution t = -ln v, so v = e^{-t}, dv = -e^{-t} dt. When v=0, t=∞; v=1, t=0. The integral becomes:

∫_∞^0 e^{-(2n -1)t} (-t) (-e^{-t} dt ) = -∫_0^∞ t e^{-(2n -1 +1)t} dt = -∫₀^∞ t e^{-2n t} dt = - [1/( (2n)^2 ) ] Γ(2) = -1/(4n² )

Wait, but the original substitution:

∫₀¹ v^{2n -2} ln v dv = ∫₀¹ v^{2n -2} ln v dv

Let me recall that ∫₀¹ x^k ln x dx = -1/(k +1)^2 for k ≠ -1. Here, k =2n -2. So:

∫₀¹ v^{2n -2} ln v dv = -1/(2n -1)^2

Therefore, Part B = 1/2 Σ_{n=1}^\infty [4^n / (2n)! ) * (-1/(2n -1)^2 ) ]

= -1/2 Σ_{n=1}^\infty [4^n / ( (2n)! (2n -1)^2 ) ]

This seems like another complicated series. Not sure if this helps.

At this point, it's clear that this approach is leading to very complicated expressions, and perhaps there's a smarter way to tackle the original integral.

Let me go back to the original integral: ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx

Maybe using integration technique with special functions. Let me recall that arccos(x) can be expressed in terms of inverse trigonometric functions, and I₁ is a Bessel function. Perhaps there's an integral transform or identity that connects these.

Alternatively, consider using the integral representation of arccos(x):

arccos(x) = ∫_x^1 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt

So the original integral becomes ∫₀¹ [ ∫_x^1 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt ] I₁(2x)/x dx

Interchange the order of integration:

= ∫₀¹ [ ∫₀^t I₁(2x)/x dx ] / sqrt(1 - t²) dt

As we did earlier. Then we found that the inner integral is Σ [ t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ]

But perhaps this inner integral can be expressed in terms of a Bessel function. Let me check.

Recall that I₁(z) = Σ [ (z/2)^{2k +1} / (k! (k +1)! ) ]

So I₁(2x) = Σ [ (2x/2)^{2k +1} / (k! (k +1)! ) ] = Σ [ x^{2k +1} / (k! (k +1)! ) ]

Therefore, I₁(2x)/x = Σ [ x^{2k} / (k! (k +1)! ) ]

Integrate from0 to t:

∫₀^t I₁(2x)/x dx = Σ [ ∫₀^t x^{2k} / (k! (k +1)! ) dx ] = Σ [ t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ]

But this series is similar to the series for the modified Bessel function, but with an extra 1/(2k +1) term. Not sure if this can be expressed in terms of known functions.

Alternatively, perhaps this series can be related to the hypergeometric function. Let me recall that hypergeometric functions can have terms with factorial denominators. For example, the hypergeometric function _pF_q is defined as Σ [ (a_1)_n ... (a_p)_n / (b_1)_n ... (b_q)_n ] z^n /n! )

In our case, the term is t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! )

Let me write this as t^{2k +1} / ( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) = t^{2k +1} / ( (k +1)! k! (2k +1) )

Let me write (k +1)! = (k +1) k!, so denominator is (k +1) (k! )^2 (2k +1)

So term is t^{2k +1} / [ (k +1) (k! )^2 (2k +1) ]

This can be written as t^{2k +1} / [ (2k +1) (k +1) (k! )^2 ]

Hmm. Let me see if this matches any hypergeometric series. For example, the hypergeometric function _2F_3 could have parameters that match these terms. Let me consider:

_2F_3(a, b; c, d, e; z) = Σ [ (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k (d)_k (e)_k ) z^k /k! ]

But our term has z^k with z = t², and the denominator has (2k +1) (k +1) (k! )^2. Let me see:

If we set a and b to some values, and c, d, e to others. Let me try to manipulate the term:

The term is t^{2k +1} / [ (2k +1) (k +1) (k! )^2 ]

= t^{2k +1} / [ (2k +1) (k +1) (k! )^2 ]

= t^{2k +1} / [ (2k +1)(k +1) (k! )^2 ]

Let me write (2k +1) = (2k +1), (k +1) = (k +1), and (k! )^2 = (k! )^2. So the denominator is (2k +1)(k +1)(k! )^2.

The numerator is t^{2k +1}.

So the term can be written as t^{2k +1} / [ (2k +1)(k +1)(k! )^2 ]

= t * (t²)^k / [ (2k +1)(k +1)(k! )^2 ]

Let me write this as t * [ (t²)^k / ( (k +1)(k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ]

= t * [ (t²)^k / ( (k +1)(k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ]

This resembles a hypergeometric function, but with multiple factorial terms. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function. Let me see:

The term can be written as t * (t²)^k / [ (k +1) (k! )^2 (2k +1) ) ]

= t / (k +1) * (t²)^k / [ (k! )^2 (2k +1) )

But I don't see a standard hypergeometric function with these terms. Therefore, it's possible that this series doesn't have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions or standard special functions.

Given that the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer, but after extensive attempts, I can't find a closed-form expression. This suggests that perhaps there's a trick or identity I'm not aware of.

Alternatively, maybe the integral numerically and see if it matches a known constant. Earlier, when summing the first few terms, we got approximately 1.1206. Let's check with numerical integration.

Using numerical methods, let's approximate the integral ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) I₁(2x) dx.

First, note that near x=0, the integrand behaves like (arccos x)/x * I₁(2x). As x approaches 0, arccos x ~ π/2 - x, so (arccos x)/x ~ π/(2x) -1. But I₁(2x) ~ x for small x (since I₁(z) ~ z/2 for small z). So the integrand near 0 behaves like (π/(2x) -1) * x ~ π/2 - x, which is finite. Therefore, the integral is convergent.

Let me use numerical approximation. Let's use a calculator or software. But since I don't have access to that, I'll proceed with approximate methods.

Alternatively, use the series expansion we derived earlier. The sum is approximately 1 + 0.111111 +0.008888 +0.0004535 +0.000141 +0.000000388 ≈1.1206. Adding more terms would give a better approximation, but it's already converging to around 1.1206.

Alternatively, check with known integrals. Wait, the integral resembles ∫₀¹ arccos(x) I₁(2x)/x dx. Let me check if this is a known integral in tables or literature.

After a quick search in my mind, I recall that integrals involving arccos and Bessel functions might be found in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik. Let me check:

In Gradshteyn-Ryzhik, 6.728 might have integrals of Bessel functions multiplied by inverse trigonometric functions. Let me check:

In section 6.728, integral 2:

∫₀¹ x^{μ -1} (1 -x²)^{ν -1/2} arccos(x) dx = ... but not sure.

Alternatively, 6.782 might have something. Alternatively, 6.567.

Alternatively, consider using integration by parts with a different choice of u and dv. Let me try again:

Let u = arccos(x), dv = I₁(2x)/x dx

Then du = -1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ I₁(2x)/x dx. But earlier, we found that ∫ I₁(2x)/x dx = Σ [x^{2k +1}/( (2k +1) k! (k +1)! ) ] which doesn't seem to have a closed-form.

Alternatively, take dv = arccos(x)/x dx, u = I₁(2x). But then du = d/dx I₁(2x) dx. The derivative of I₁(2x) is 2 I₀(2x) - (1/x) I₁(2x). Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of I₁(2x). For example, I₁(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x * (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} cosθ dθ dx

= (1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ

Interchange the order:

= (1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ

Now, focus on the inner integral ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x e^{2x cosθ} dx. Let me substitute t = arccos x. Then x = cos t, dx = -sin t dt. When x=0, t=π/2; x=1, t=0.

So the inner integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^0 t / cos t * e^{2 cos t cosθ} (-sin t) dt

= ∫₀^{π/2} t / cos t * e^{2 cos t cosθ} sin t dt

= ∫₀^{π/2} t e^{2 cos t cosθ} tan t dt

This seems complicated, but perhaps expanding the exponential in a series:

e^{2 cos t cosθ} = Σ_{n=0}^\infty (2 cos t cosθ)^n /n!

So the inner integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^\infty (2^n cos^nθ /n! ) ∫₀^{π/2} t cos^n t tan t dt

= Σ_{n=0}^\infty (2^n cos^nθ /n! ) ∫₀^{π/2} t cos^{n -1} t sin t dt

Let me make substitution u = cos t, so du = -sin t dt, when t=0, u=1; t=π/2, u=0.

The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} t cos^{n -1} t sin t dt = ∫₁^0 t (u^{n -1}) (-du) = ∫₀¹ t u^{n -1} du

But t is arccos u, so:

= ∫₀¹ arccos u * u^{n -1} du

This is the same as ∫₀¹ arccos x x^{n -1} dx, which we've encountered earlier. From previous steps, we know that:

∫₀¹ arccos x x^{m} dx = (2^{2k} (k! )^2 ) / ( (2k +1)^2 (2k)! ) ) when m=2k. But here, m =n -1. So if n -1 is even, say n -1=2k, then n=2k +1. Otherwise, for odd exponents, the integral is different. Wait, but in our previous steps, we considered even exponents. For general m, the integral ∫₀¹ arccos x x^{m} dx can be expressed as:

Using integration by parts, as before:

Let u = arccos x, dv = x^m dx

Then du = -1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx, v = x^{m +1}/(m +1)

So uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du = [arccos x * x^{m +1}/(m +1) ]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ x^{m +1}/(m +1) * 1/sqrt(1 -x²) dx

The boundary term is 0, so integral becomes (1/(m +1)) ∫₀¹ x^{m +1}/sqrt(1 -x²) dx

Which, as before, substituting x = sinθ, becomes (1/(m +1)) ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{m +1}θ dθ

Which is (1/(m +1)) * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ( (m +2)/2 ) / Γ( (m +3)/2 )

But for integer m, this can be expressed in terms of double factorials. For example, if m +1 is even, say m +1=2k, then the integral is (1/(m +1)) * ( (2k -1)!! / (2k)!! ) * π/2 )

But this is getting too involved. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress towards a closed-form, I think that perhaps the integral doesn't have a simple closed-form expression and must be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or other advanced functions, or evaluated numerically.

Given that the problem asks for an exact answer, but I can't find a closed-form, perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of a series. However, the problem states to compute it analytically to obtain the exact answer, which suggests that there is a closed-form.

Wait, perhaps using the result from the series sum. Earlier, we found that the integral equals Σ [2^{2k} / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ] from k=0 to ∞. Let me check if this sum can be expressed in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that this sum is related to the Bessel functions or other special functions. Let me consider the sum:

S = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [4^k / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

Let me write 4^k = 2^{2k}, and (2k)! = (2k)(2k -1)...1. Let me see if this can be related to the hypergeometric function _4F_3 or similar.

The general term of a hypergeometric function _pF_q is:

_pF_q(a_1, ..., a_p; b_1, ..., b_q; z) = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [ (a_1)_k ... (a_p)_k / (b_1)_k ... (b_q)_k ] z^k /k! )

Our term is 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

Let me write this as:

[4^k / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ) ]

= [ (4)^k / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ) ]

Let me express this as:

[ (2^{2k} ) / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ) ]

Let me see if this can be written in terms of Pochhammer symbols. The term (2k)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k. Using the duplication formula, but not sure.

Alternatively, note that (2k +1) = (2k +1), which can be written as (2k +1) = 2(k +1/2). So (2k +1)^2 =4(k +1/2)^2.

So the term becomes:

[4^k / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / (4(k +1/2)^2 (k +1) ) ]

= [4^{k -1} / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) ) ]

But I still don't see a clear hypergeometric function representation.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to conclude that the integral evaluates to a series that doesn't have a simple closed-form, and thus the exact answer is expressed as this infinite series. However, the problem states to compute it analytically to obtain the exact answer, which suggests that there is a closed-form. Therefore, I must have missed something.

Wait, let me check if the original integral can be related to the integral of a product of Bessel functions and arccos. Alternatively, perhaps using integration by parts with a different choice.

Let me try integrating by parts again, but this time choosing u = I₁(2x) and dv = arccos(x)/x dx.

Then du = d/dx I₁(2x) dx = 2 I₀(2x) - (1/x) I₁(2x) (using the derivative formula for Bessel functions: d/dx I_n(x) = I_{n-1}(x) - (n/x) I_n(x). For n=1, d/dx I₁(2x) = 2 I₀(2x) - (1/x) I₁(2x) )

And v = ∫ arccos(x)/x dx. Let me compute v:

v = ∫ arccos(x)/x dx. Let me substitute t = arccos(x), so x = cos t, dx = -sin t dt. Then:

v = ∫ t / cos t * (-sin t) dt = -∫ t tan t dt

Integrate by parts: let u = t, dv = tan t dt

Then du = dt, v = -ln |cos t|

So v = - [ -t ln cos t + ∫ ln cos t dt ] = t ln cos t - ∫ ln cos t dt

The integral ∫ ln cos t dt is a known integral, which equals - (t^2)/2 + t ln 2 - (Cl_2(π/2 - t) + Cl_2(π/2 + t))/2, where Cl_2 is the Clausen function. This seems too involved. Therefore, this approach doesn't seem helpful.

Given that all methods lead to complicated expressions or series, and the problem requires an exact answer, I must conclude that the integral evaluates to the series we derived, which is:

Σ_{k=0}^\infty [2^{2k} / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

But this is not a standard special function. However, upon checking mathematical literature or using advanced mathematical software, this sum might be expressible in terms of known constants or functions. Alternatively, the integral might have a closed-form expression involving Shi(2) or other hyperbolic integrals.

Given that the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1206, and recalling that Shi(2) is approximately 2.2796, and cosh(2) is approximately 3.7622, the earlier expression for Part A was Shi(2) - (cosh(2) -1)/2 ≈ 2.2796 - (3.7622 -1)/2 ≈ 2.2796 - 1.3811 ≈ 0.8985. But this is less than the numerical approximation of 1.1206, so there must be a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum S is equal to the original integral, which is approximately 1.1206. However, without a closed-form, I can't provide an exact answer. Given the problem instructions, I might have to accept that the exact answer is expressed as this series, but the problem likely expects a closed-form. 

Wait, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function or other special functions, but I'm not familiar enough with that. Alternatively, consulting integral tables again, perhaps in Prudnikov et al., but I don't have access.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be equal to π/2. The numerical approximation is around 1.1206, and π/2 is approximately 1.5708, which is larger. Not matching. Alternatively, π²/8 ≈ 1.2337, closer but still not matching. The numerical value we have is around 1.1206.

Alternatively, check if the sum S can be expressed in terms of known constants. Let me compute more terms:

k=0: 1

k=1: 4 / (3^2 * 2 * 2! ) =4/(9*2*2)=4/36=1/9≈0.111111

k=2: 16 / (5^2 *3 *4! )=16/(25*3*24)=16/1800≈0.008888

k=3:64/(7^2 *4 *6! )=64/(49*4*720)=64/(141120)=≈0.0004535

k=4:256/(9^2 *5 *8! )=256/(81*5*40320)=256/16329600≈0.0000157

Wait, previous calculation for k=4 was wrong. Let me recalculate:

For k=4:

2^{2*4} = 256

Denominator: (2*4 +1)^2*(4 +1)*(2*4)! =9^2*5*8! =81*5*40320=81*201600=16329600

So term=256/16329600≈0.0000157

So sum up to k=4:1 +0.111111+0.008888+0.0004535+0.0000157≈1.120468. Adding k=5 term:

k=5: 1024/(11^2 *6 *10! )=1024/(121*6*3628800)=1024/(121*21772800)=1024/2634508800≈0.000000389

Total sum≈1.120468 +0.000000389≈1.120468. So converges to approximately 1.120468. Let's check with numerical integration.

Using numerical integration of the original integral:

The integrand is (arccos x)/x * I₁(2x). Let's approximate this using Simpson's rule with a few intervals.

But without computational tools, it's hard, but given the series sum to be approximately 1.1205, and the problem requires an exact answer, I might have to accept that the exact answer is this series. However, the problem states to compute it analytically, so perhaps there's a closed-form I'm missing.

Wait, let me consider the original integral:

∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x I₁(2x) dx

Let me use the substitution x = sinθ, so dx = cosθ dθ, arccos(x) = π/2 - θ, and when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2.

The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ)/sinθ * I₁(2 sinθ) * cosθ dθ

= ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) cotθ I₁(2 sinθ) cosθ dθ

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, expand I₁(2 sinθ) in series:

I₁(2 sinθ) = Σ [ (2 sinθ)^{2k +1} / (2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ) ) ] = Σ [ sin^{2k +1}θ / (k! (k +1)! ) )

So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) cotθ cosθ Σ [ sin^{2k +1}θ / (k! (k +1)! ) ) ] dθ

= Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) cotθ cosθ sin^{2k +1}θ dθ ]

But cotθ cosθ = cos²θ / sinθ

So the integral becomes Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) cos²θ sin^{2k}θ dθ ]

= Σ [1/(k! (k +1)! ) ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) sin^{2k}θ cos²θ dθ ]

This integral might be expressible in terms of beta functions or other integrals. Let me split the integral into two parts:

∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - θ) sin^{2k}θ cos²θ dθ = π/2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}θ cos²θ dθ - ∫₀^{π/2} θ sin^{2k}θ cos²θ dθ

The first integral is π/2 * [ (sqrt(π)/2 Γ(k +1/2) Γ(3/2) ) / Γ(k +2) ) ] using beta function properties. But this is getting too involved.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I must conclude that the exact answer is the series we derived, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1205. However, since the problem requires an exact answer, and given that I can't find a closed-form, I might have to present the series as the exact answer. But the problem instructions say to compute it analytically, so there must be a closed-form. 

Wait, perhaps the integral is related to the Catalan constant or other constants. The numerical value of the sum is approximately 1.1205, which is close to π²/8 ≈ 1.2337, but not quite. Alternatively, it's approximately 1.1205, which is close to 1.1205, but I don't recognize this constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral equals 2. But the numerical value is 1.1205, so no. Alternatively, check if the sum S can be expressed in terms of known constants. Let me compute S to more decimal places.

Sum up to k=5:

1 + 1/9 + 4/450 + 64/141120 + 256/16329600 + 1024/2634508800

=1 +0.1111111111 +0.0088888889 +0.0004535147 +0.0000156863 +0.0000003889

=1.1204695899

So approximately 1.1204695899. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is 1.1204695899. Let me check if this matches any known constant. 

Searching my memory, the value doesn't match common constants like Catalan's constant (0.9159), or others. Therefore, it's likely that the integral doesn't have a closed-form in terms of elementary functions and is expressed as this series. However, the problem states to compute it analytically, so perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let me try to express the sum S as a hypergeometric function.

The sum S is Σ_{k=0}^\infty [4^k / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ) ]

Let me write 4^k = (2)^{2k}, and (2k)! = (2k)! )

Let me express the term as:

(2^{2k} ) / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

= [ (2^{2k} ) / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ) ]

Let me write this as:

[ (4^k ) / (2k)! ) ] * [1 / ( (2k +1)^2 (k +1) ) ]

Let me consider the hypergeometric function _4F_3. The general term of a _4F_3 function is:

Σ [ (a)_k (b)_k (c)_k (d)_k / (e)_k (f)_k (g)_k ) ] z^k /k! )

Comparing with our term, we have:

Term = 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

= 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

= 4^k / [ (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

Let me write (2k +1)^2 = (2k +1)(2k +1), and (k +1) = (k +1). So the denominator is (2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)! )

Let me express (2k)! = 2^{2k} k! ) (1/2)_k / 1, using the duplication formula. However, this might not help.

Alternatively, express the term in terms of Pochhammer symbols. Let me note that:

(2k +1) = 2(k +1/2), so (2k +1)^2 =4(k +1/2)^2

(k +1) = (k +1)

(2k)! = 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k

Therefore, the term becomes:

4^k / [4(k +1/2)^2 (k +1) 2^{2k} k! (1/2)_k ) ]

= 4^k / [4 *2^{2k} (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) k! (1/2)_k ) ]

= 1 / [4 *2^{2k} /4^k * (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) k! (1/2)_k ) ]

Wait, 4^k / (4 *2^{2k}) =4^k / (4 *4^k )=1/4

So term=1/4 * 1 / [ (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) k! (1/2)_k ) ]

But (1/2)_k = (1/2)(3/2)...( (2k -1)/2 ) = (2k)! )/(4^k k! )

Therefore, (1/2)_k = (2k)! )/(4^k k! )

So substituting back:

term=1/4 * 1 / [ (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) k! (2k)! / (4^k k! ) ) ]

=1/4 * 4^k k! / [ (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) k! (2k)! ) ]

=4^{k -1} / [ (k +1/2)^2 (k +1) (2k)! ) ]

This doesn't seem to lead to a hypergeometric function.

Given that I can't find a closed-form expression, I'll have to present the exact answer as the infinite series and provide the numerical approximation. However, the problem states to compute it analytically to obtain the exact answer, which suggests that there is a closed-form. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I might have to concede that I can't find the exact closed-form and provide the series and numerical approximation.

But since the user expects an answer, and given that the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1205, and the series converges to this value, I'll proceed to provide the series as the exact answer in LaTeX and the numerical value. However, upon checking with mathematical literature, I find that this integral might be related to the expression involving the hypergeometric function. For example, the integral can be expressed as:

Σ_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4^k}{(2k +1)^2 (k +1) (2k)!}

But this is not a standard function. Alternatively, using the Meijer G-function, but I'm not sure.

Given the problem's instructions, I'll proceed to provide the series as the exact answer and the numerical approximation.
