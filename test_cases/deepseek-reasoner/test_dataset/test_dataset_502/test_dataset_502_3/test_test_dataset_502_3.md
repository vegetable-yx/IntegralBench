Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 64 to 729 of (x^(1/2))/(x^(1/2) - x^(1/3)) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the integrand first. 

First, let me write down the integral again to make sure I have it right:

∫_{64}^{729} [x^(1/2) / [x^(1/2) - x^(1/3)]] dx

I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have terms with x raised to fractional exponents. Maybe I can factor out a common term or make a substitution to simplify this. Let's see. The denominator is x^(1/2) - x^(1/3). If I factor out the smaller exponent, which is x^(1/3), that would give x^(1/3)(x^(1/2 - 1/3) - 1). Let me compute the exponent: 1/2 - 1/3 is (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6. So the denominator becomes x^(1/3)(x^(1/6) - 1). 

So the integrand becomes [x^(1/2)] / [x^(1/3)(x^(1/6) - 1)] = x^(1/2 - 1/3) / (x^(1/6) - 1). Let's compute the exponent in the numerator: 1/2 - 1/3 = 1/6. So now the integrand is x^(1/6)/(x^(1/6) - 1). 

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. So the integral is ∫ [x^(1/6)] / [x^(1/6) - 1] dx from 64 to 729. Maybe I can make a substitution here. Let me set t = x^(1/6). Then, x = t^6, so dx = 6t^5 dt. Let's check that substitution. 

If t = x^(1/6), then x = t^6, so dx/dt = 6t^5, so dx = 6t^5 dt. Then, substituting into the integral, the limits of integration will change. When x = 64, t = 64^(1/6). Let's compute that. 64 is 2^6, so 64^(1/6) = 2. Similarly, 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6, so 729^(1/6) = 3. So the new limits are from t=2 to t=3. 

Now, substituting into the integrand: x^(1/6) is t, and the denominator is t - 1. So the integrand becomes t / (t - 1) * 6t^5 dt. Let's write that out:

Integral from t=2 to t=3 of [t/(t - 1)] * 6t^5 dt. Simplify the expression inside the integral. Multiply t by 6t^5: that's 6t^6. So the integral becomes 6 ∫_{2}^{3} [t^6 / (t - 1)] dt. 

Hmm, so now the integral is 6 times the integral of t^6/(t - 1) from 2 to 3. To integrate t^6/(t - 1), maybe I can perform polynomial long division, since the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator. Let's divide t^6 by t - 1. 

Using polynomial division: t^6 divided by t - 1. Let's recall that t^6 - 1 factors as (t - 1)(t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1). So t^6 = (t - 1)(t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1) + 1. Therefore, t^6/(t - 1) = t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1 + 1/(t - 1). 

So, the integral becomes 6 ∫ [t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1 + 1/(t - 1)] dt from 2 to 3. Now, integrating term by term:

Integral of t^5 is (t^6)/6, integral of t^4 is (t^5)/5, integral of t^3 is (t^4)/4, integral of t^2 is (t^3)/3, integral of t is (t^2)/2, integral of 1 is t, and integral of 1/(t - 1) is ln|t - 1|. 

So putting it all together, the integral is 6 [ (t^6/6 + t^5/5 + t^4/4 + t^3/3 + t^2/2 + t + ln|t - 1| ) ] evaluated from t=2 to t=3. 

Let's compute this expression at the upper limit t=3 and subtract the same expression at the lower limit t=2. 

First, compute at t=3:

(3^6)/6 + (3^5)/5 + (3^4)/4 + (3^3)/3 + (3^2)/2 + 3 + ln(2)

Compute each term:

3^6 = 729, so 729/6 = 121.5

3^5 = 243, 243/5 = 48.6

3^4 = 81, 81/4 = 20.25

3^3 = 27, 27/3 = 9

3^2 = 9/2 = 4.5

3 is 3

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056, but we'll keep it as ln(2) for exact value.

So summing these:

121.5 + 48.6 = 170.1

170.1 + 20.25 = 190.35

190.35 + 9 = 199.35

199.35 + 4.5 = 203.85

203.85 + 3 = 206.85

206.85 + ln(2) ≈ 206.85 + 0.69314718056 ≈ 207.54314718056

But we need to keep it exact. So the exact value at t=3 is:

729/6 + 243/5 + 81/4 + 27/3 + 9/2 + 3 + ln(2)

Similarly, compute at t=2:

(2^6)/6 + (2^5)/5 + (2^4)/4 + (2^3)/3 + (2^2)/2 + 2 + ln(1)

But ln(1) is 0.

Compute each term:

2^6 = 64, 64/6 = 32/3 ≈ 10.6666666667

2^5 = 32, 32/5 = 6.4

2^4 = 16, 16/4 = 4

2^3 = 8, 8/3 ≈ 2.6666666667

2^2 = 4, 4/2 = 2

2 is 2

So summing these:

32/3 + 32/5 + 4 + 8/3 + 2 + 2

Convert all to fractions with denominator 15:

32/3 = 160/15

32/5 = 96/15

4 = 60/15

8/3 = 40/15

2 = 30/15

2 = 30/15

Adding them up:

160 + 96 = 256

256 + 60 = 316

316 + 40 = 356

356 + 30 = 386

386 + 30 = 416

Total: 416/15

So the exact value at t=2 is 416/15 + 0 = 416/15.

Therefore, the integral from 2 to 3 is [ (729/6 + 243/5 + 81/4 + 27/3 + 9/2 + 3 + ln(2)) - (416/15) ].

But let's compute each term exactly:

First, let's compute each term at t=3:

729/6 = 243/2

243/5 remains as is.

81/4 remains as is.

27/3 = 9

9/2 remains as is.

3 is 3.

So sum these:

243/2 + 243/5 + 81/4 + 9 + 9/2 + 3 + ln(2)

Combine the fractions:

Let's convert all to denominators of 20.

243/2 = (243*10)/20 = 2430/20

243/5 = (243*4)/20 = 972/20

81/4 = (81*5)/20 = 405/20

9 = 180/20

9/2 = (9*10)/20 = 90/20

3 = 60/20

So:

2430/20 + 972/20 + 405/20 + 180/20 + 90/20 + 60/20 =

2430 + 972 = 3402

3402 + 405 = 3807

3807 + 180 = 3987

3987 + 90 = 4077

4077 + 60 = 4137

So total is 4137/20 + ln(2)

Then subtract the value at t=2, which is 416/15.

So the integral from 2 to 3 is:

(4137/20 + ln(2)) - 416/15

Compute 4137/20 - 416/15:

Find a common denominator, which is 60.

4137/20 = (4137*3)/60 = 12411/60

416/15 = (416*4)/60 = 1664/60

So 12411/60 - 1664/60 = (12411 - 1664)/60 = 10747/60

Therefore, the integral from 2 to 3 is 10747/60 + ln(2)

But remember, the original integral was 6 times this. So multiply by 6:

6*(10747/60 + ln(2)) = 10747/10 + 6 ln(2) = 1074.7 + 6 ln(2)

But let's compute it exactly:

10747/10 is 1074.7, but in fraction terms, 10747/10. However, 6 ln(2) is just 6 times the natural logarithm of 2.

So the exact answer is 10747/10 + 6 ln(2). Let me check if 10747/10 can be written as a mixed number, but probably better to leave it as a fraction. Alternatively, 10747 divided by 10 is 1074.7, but in exact terms, it's 10747/10.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation again because I might have made a mistake in the subtraction step.

Wait, the integral from 2 to 3 is [ (sum at t=3) - (sum at t=2) ].

Sum at t=3: 4137/20 + ln(2)

Sum at t=2: 416/15

So the difference is 4137/20 - 416/15 + ln(2)

Compute 4137/20 - 416/15:

Convert to common denominator 60:

4137/20 = 4137 * 3 / 60 = 12411/60

416/15 = 416 * 4 / 60 = 1664/60

So 12411 - 1664 = 10747, so 10747/60

Therefore, the difference is 10747/60 + ln(2)

Then multiply by 6:

6*(10747/60 + ln(2)) = (6*10747)/60 + 6 ln(2) = 10747/10 + 6 ln(2)

Yes, that's correct. 6*(10747/60) = 10747/10.

So the exact answer is 10747/10 + 6 ln(2). Let's check if 10747/10 can be simplified. 10747 divided by 10 is 1074.7, but as a fraction, it's 10747/10. So the exact value is 10747/10 + 6 ln(2). 

Now, let's write this in LaTeX. The exact answer is \frac{10747}{10} + 6\ln(2). But maybe we can combine the terms if possible, but I think that's as simplified as it gets. 

Now, for the numerical approximation. Let's compute 10747/10 first. 10747 divided by 10 is 1074.7. Then, 6 ln(2) is approximately 6 * 0.69314718056 ≈ 4.15888308336. Adding these together: 1074.7 + 4.15888308336 ≈ 1078.85888308336. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1078.8588830834. 

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 10747/10:

10747 ÷ 10 = 1074.7

6 * ln(2) ≈ 6 * 0.69314718056 ≈ 4.15888308336

Adding them: 1074.7 + 4.15888308336 = 1078.85888308336

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1078.8588830834

But let me confirm the exact steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution or the polynomial division.

Wait, let's verify the substitution steps again. Original integral after substitution was 6 ∫_{2}^{3} [t^6/(t - 1)] dt. Then, using the division, t^6/(t - 1) = t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1 + 1/(t - 1). That's correct because (t - 1)(t^5 + t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1) = t^6 - 1, so t^6 = (t - 1)(polynomial) + 1. Therefore, t^6/(t - 1) = polynomial + 1/(t - 1). So that's correct.

Then integrating term by term gives the sum of the integrals. Then evaluating from 2 to 3. Then the calculation of each term at t=3 and t=2. Then subtracting. Then multiplying by 6. So the steps seem correct. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 10747/10 + 6 ln(2), and the numerical approximation is approximately 1078.8588830834. 

But let me check the calculation of the sum at t=3 again. Let's compute each term exactly:

At t=3:

t^6/6 = 729/6 = 121.5

t^5/5 = 243/5 = 48.6

t^4/4 = 81/4 = 20.25

t^3/3 = 27/3 = 9

t^2/2 = 9/2 = 4.5

t = 3

ln(t - 1) = ln(2)

Adding these:

121.5 + 48.6 = 170.1

170.1 + 20.25 = 190.35

190.35 + 9 = 199.35

199.35 + 4.5 = 203.85

203.85 + 3 = 206.85

206.85 + ln(2)

At t=3, the sum is 206.85 + ln(2)

At t=2:

t^6/6 = 64/6 = 32/3 ≈ 10.6666666667

t^5/5 = 32/5 = 6.4

t^4/4 = 16/4 = 4

t^3/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.6666666667

t^2/2 = 4/2 = 2

t = 2

ln(t - 1) = ln(1) = 0

Adding these:

32/3 + 32/5 + 4 + 8/3 + 2 + 2

Convert to fractions:

32/3 + 8/3 = 40/3

32/5 remains as is.

4 + 2 + 2 = 8

So total is 40/3 + 32/5 + 8

Convert to common denominator 15:

40/3 = 200/15

32/5 = 96/15

8 = 120/15

Total: (200 + 96 + 120)/15 = 416/15 ≈ 27.7333333333

So the difference between t=3 and t=2 is (206.85 + ln(2)) - 416/15

But 206.85 is 206.85/1 = 206.85. Let's convert 416/15 to decimal: 416 ÷ 15 = 27.7333333333

So 206.85 - 27.7333333333 = 179.1166666667

Then add ln(2): 179.1166666667 + 0.69314718056 ≈ 179.8098138473

Then multiply by 6: 179.8098138473 * 6 ≈ 1078.8588830838

Ah, here's a mistake! Wait, earlier I thought that the integral from 2 to 3 was 10747/60 + ln(2), but when converting to decimal, I must have miscalculated. Let me check:

Wait, the integral from 2 to 3 is [ (sum at t=3) - (sum at t=2) ] = (206.85 + ln(2)) - (416/15). But 206.85 is 206.85, and 416/15 is 27.7333333333. So 206.85 - 27.7333333333 = 179.1166666667. Then add ln(2): 179.1166666667 + 0.69314718056 ≈ 179.8098138473. Then multiply by 6: 179.8098138473 * 6 ≈ 1078.8588830838. So the numerical value is approximately 1078.8588830838, which rounds to 1078.8588830838 when rounded to 10 decimal places. 

But wait, this contradicts my previous exact calculation where I had 10747/10 + 6 ln(2). Let's see:

10747/10 is 1074.7, and 6 ln(2) is approximately 4.15888308336. So 1074.7 + 4.15888308336 = 1078.85888308336, which matches the decimal calculation. So the exact answer is indeed 10747/10 + 6 ln(2), and the numerical approximation is approximately 1078.8588830834 when rounded to 10 decimal places. 

Therefore, the final answer should be:

Exact: \frac{10747}{10} + 6\ln(2)

Numerical: 1078.8588830834

But let me check if 10747/10 is correct. Let's go back to the step where we had:

The integral from 2 to 3 is 10747/60 + ln(2). Then multiplying by 6 gives 10747/10 + 6 ln(2). Yes, because 10747/60 *6 = 10747/10. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the exact answer is \boxed{\dfrac{10747}{10} + 6\ln(2)} and the numerical approximation is approximately 1078.8588830834.
