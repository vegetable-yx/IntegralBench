Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of sec(x) from π/6 to π/3. Hmm, I remember that the integral of sec(x) is a standard one. Let me recall... Oh right, the integral of sec(x) dx is ln |sec(x) + tan(x)| + C. So, I can use that antiderivative.

First, let me write down the indefinite integral. So, ∫ sec(x) dx = ln |sec(x) + tan(x)| + C. Since we're dealing with definite integral from π/6 to π/3, I need to evaluate this antiderivative at the upper limit π/3 and subtract its value at the lower limit π/6.

So, the exact answer should be [ln(sec(π/3) + tan(π/3))] - [ln(sec(π/6) + tan(π/6))]. Let me compute each part step by step.

Starting with the upper limit π/3. Let's recall the values of sec and tan at π/3. The cosine of π/3 is 0.5, so sec(π/3) is 1/(0.5) = 2. The tangent of π/3 is √3. So, sec(π/3) + tan(π/3) = 2 + √3.

Now the lower limit π/6. Cosine of π/6 is √3/2, so sec(π/6) is 2/√3. Tangent of π/6 is 1/√3. Therefore, sec(π/6) + tan(π/6) = (2/√3) + (1/√3) = 3/√3 = √3. Wait, that simplifies to √3? Let me check: 2/√3 + 1/√3 is (2 + 1)/√3 = 3/√3 = √3. Yes, that's correct.

So, substituting back into the antiderivative, the exact value is ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3). Using logarithm properties, this can be written as ln[(2 + √3)/√3]. Let me simplify that expression. (2 + √3)/√3 = 2/√3 + √3/√3 = 2/√3 + 1. Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator, 2/√3 is (2√3)/3, so it becomes (2√3)/3 + 1. But maybe it's better to leave it as ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3) or combine them. Alternatively, we can write it as ln((2 + √3)/√3) = ln(2/√3 + 1). But perhaps the original form is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to simplify further. Let me compute (2 + √3)/√3. Let's divide numerator and denominator by √3: (2/√3) + (√3/√3) = 2/√3 + 1. But 2/√3 is the same as 2√3/3, so it's 1 + (2√3)/3. Not sure if that's simpler. Maybe the answer is better left as ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3), or combined as ln((2 + √3)/√3). Either way, both are correct. Let me check if there's a known identity here. Wait, 2 + √3 is actually equal to (√3 + 1)^2 / 2? Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute (√3 + 1)^2: that's 3 + 2√3 + 1 = 4 + 2√3. No, that's not 2 + √3. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can rationalize the expression (2 + √3)/√3. Let's see: (2 + √3)/√3 = 2/√3 + 1. If we rationalize 2/√3, it becomes (2√3)/3. So, (2√3)/3 + 1. But maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is better expressed as ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3). Let me check if that's the simplest form. Since ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), so yes, that's correct.

So, the exact answer is ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3) or ln((2 + √3)/√3). Either form is acceptable. Let me check if there's a more simplified version. Alternatively, maybe we can write it as ln(2 + √3) - (1/2) ln(3), since ln(√3) is (1/2) ln(3). But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of logarithms of the evaluated expressions. So, maybe the answer is best presented as ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3). Let me confirm that.

Now, moving on to the numerical approximation. Let's compute the value step by step. First, compute 2 + √3. √3 is approximately 1.7320508075688772. So, 2 + 1.7320508075688772 ≈ 3.732050807568877. Then, ln(3.732050807568877). Let me compute that. Using a calculator, ln(3.732050807568877) is approximately 1.31700038415. Then, ln(√3). √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772, so ln(1.7320508075688772) ≈ 0.54930614433. Therefore, subtracting these two: 1.31700038415 - 0.54930614433 ≈ 0.76769423982. Let me check this with a calculator. Alternatively, maybe compute the difference directly. Let me use more precise calculations.

Alternatively, compute (2 + √3)/√3 first. Let's compute that. 2 + √3 ≈ 3.732050807568877. Divided by √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772. So, 3.732050807568877 / 1.7320508075688772 ≈ 2.1547005383792515. Wait, that's 2.1547... Then, ln(2.1547005383792515). Let me compute that. The natural logarithm of 2.1547 is approximately 0.767694. So, that's the same as before. So, the numerical value is approximately 0.767694. Let me check with more decimal places. Let me use a calculator for higher precision.

Alternatively, use the exact value. Let me use a calculator to compute ln(2 + sqrt(3)) - ln(sqrt(3)) numerically. Let's compute each term:

First, compute 2 + sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772935

So, 2 + sqrt(3) ≈ 3.7320508075688772935

ln(3.7320508075688772935) ≈ 1.3170003830816095

Then, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772935

ln(1.7320508075688772935) ≈ 0.5493061443340548

Subtracting: 1.3170003830816095 - 0.5493061443340547 ≈ 0.7676942387475548

Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7676942387. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, compute the integral numerically using another approach. For example, using the integral of sec(x) from π/6 to π/3. Let's compute the integral numerically using a calculator. The exact value is ln(2 + sqrt(3)) - ln(sqrt(3)) ≈ 0.7676942387. So, the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7676942387, which rounds to 0.7676942387 when keeping 10 decimal places. So, the numerical approximation is 0.7676942387.

Therefore, the exact answer is ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3), which can be written as \ln\left(2 + \sqrt{3}\right) - \ln\left(\sqrt{3}\right) or combined as \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\right). Alternatively, simplifying the fraction inside the logarithm:

(2 + √3)/√3 = 2/√3 + √3/√3 = 2/√3 + 1 = (2√3)/3 + 1. But perhaps the simplest exact form is \ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) - \ln(\sqrt{3}), which is equivalent to \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\right). Either form is acceptable, but maybe the problem expects the first form. Let me check if there's a more simplified version. Alternatively, note that (2 + √3)/√3 = 2/√3 + 1 = 2√3/3 + 1. But that might not be simpler. Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator:

(2 + √3)/√3 = (2 + √3) * √3 / (√3 * √3) = (2√3 + 3)/3. So, that's (3 + 2√3)/3. Then, ln((3 + 2√3)/3) = ln(1 + (2√3)/3). But I don't think that's any simpler. So, the exact answer is best left as ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3) or the combined logarithm. Let me check if there's a known exact value. Wait, 2 + √3 is actually equal to sec(π/12) + tan(π/12) or something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express this in terms of inverse hyperbolic functions, but I think the natural logarithm form is the standard answer.

Therefore, the exact answer is ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3), which can be written as \boxed{\ln(2 + \sqrt{3}) - \ln(\sqrt{3})} or combined as \boxed{\ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}. Either form is correct, but perhaps the first one is more straightforward. Alternatively, since ln(√3) is (1/2) ln(3), so the answer can also be written as ln(2 + √3) - (1/2) ln(3). But unless specified, the original form is acceptable.

So, the final exact answer is ln(2 + √3) - ln(√3), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7676942387 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
