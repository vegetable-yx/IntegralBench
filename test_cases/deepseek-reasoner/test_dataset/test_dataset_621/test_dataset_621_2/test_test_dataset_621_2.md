Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/2 of ln(sin x) divided by cos²x dx. Hmm, let's see. First, I should write down the integral: ∫₀^{π/2} [ln(sin x)] / cos²x dx. 

I remember that integrating functions involving logarithms and trigonometric functions can sometimes be tricky. Maybe integration by parts would work here? Let me recall the formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let's choose u and dv. 

Let me set u = ln(sin x). Then du would be (cos x / sin x) dx, right? Because the derivative of ln(sin x) is (cos x)/(sin x). Then dv would be 1 / cos²x dx. To find v, I need to integrate dv. The integral of 1/cos²x dx is tan x, since d/dx tan x = sec²x = 1/cos²x. So v = tan x.

Applying integration by parts: uv - ∫v du. So that's ln(sin x) * tan x evaluated from 0 to π/2 minus the integral of tan x * (cos x / sin x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Let me simplify the integral part. The integral becomes ∫ tan x * (cos x / sin x) dx. Let's see, tan x is sin x / cos x, so substituting that in: ∫ (sin x / cos x) * (cos x / sin x) dx. The sin x and cos x terms cancel out, so it's just ∫1 dx. So the integral simplifies to x. Therefore, the entire expression becomes [ln(sin x) * tan x] from 0 to π/2 minus [x] from 0 to π/2.

Now, let's evaluate the boundary terms. First, the term [ln(sin x) * tan x] at π/2 and 0. 

At x = π/2: sin(π/2) = 1, so ln(1) = 0. tan(π/2) is undefined, but approaching π/2 from the left, tan x approaches infinity. However, ln(1) is 0, so 0 * infinity is an indeterminate form. Hmm, need to check the limit as x approaches π/2 from the left. Let's compute lim_{x→π/2^-} ln(sin x) * tan x. Let me rewrite tan x as sin x / cos x. So the expression becomes ln(sin x) * (sin x / cos x). As x approaches π/2, cos x approaches 0, sin x approaches 1. So ln(sin x) approaches ln(1) = 0. So we have 0 * (1/0), which is 0 * infinity. To resolve this, maybe use L'Hospital's Rule. Let me set t = π/2 - x, so as x approaches π/2, t approaches 0 from the right. Then sin x = sin(π/2 - t) = cos t, and cos x = sin t. So the expression becomes ln(cos t) * (cos t / sin t). As t approaches 0, cos t ≈ 1 - t²/2, ln(cos t) ≈ -t²/2, and sin t ≈ t. So substituting, we get (-t²/2) * (1 / t) = -t/2, which approaches 0 as t approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is 0. So the upper boundary term is 0.

At x = 0: sin x approaches 0, so ln(sin x) approaches -infinity, and tan x approaches 0. So again, we have -infinity * 0. Let's check the limit as x approaches 0 from the right. ln(sin x) ~ ln x (since sin x ~ x as x→0), so ln x * tan x ~ ln x * x. The limit as x→0+ of x ln x is 0, since x approaches 0 and ln x approaches -infinity, but x dominates. So the product is 0. Therefore, the lower boundary term is also 0. So the entire boundary term [ln(sin x) * tan x] from 0 to π/2 is 0 - 0 = 0.

Now, the integral becomes 0 - [x] from 0 to π/2, which is - (π/2 - 0) = -π/2. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the integral after integration by parts is [uv] - ∫v du. So the integral is equal to [uv] - ∫v du. So in this case, it's 0 - ∫1 dx from 0 to π/2, which is 0 - (π/2 - 0) = -π/2. But wait, the original integral is ∫ [ln(sin x)/cos²x] dx from 0 to π/2. So according to this, the integral equals -π/2. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, when I did the integration by parts, I set u = ln(sin x), dv = 1/cos²x dx. Then du = (cos x / sin x) dx, v = tan x. Then the integral becomes uv| - ∫v du. So uv is ln(sin x) * tan x evaluated from 0 to π/2, which we found to be 0. Then minus ∫ tan x * (cos x / sin x) dx. Let's check that integral again. tan x is sin x / cos x, so multiplying by (cos x / sin x) gives (sin x / cos x) * (cos x / sin x) = 1. So the integral becomes ∫1 dx from 0 to π/2, which is π/2. Therefore, the integral is 0 - π/2 = -π/2. So the answer is -π/2. But wait, let me check if that's correct.

But I have a feeling that this might not be correct because the integrand is negative. Let's see, in the interval (0, π/2), sin x is between 0 and 1, so ln(sin x) is negative. cos²x is positive, so the integrand is negative over the entire domain. Therefore, the integral should be negative. So -π/2 is a possible answer. But let me verify with another method or check if there's a mistake in the integration by parts.

Alternatively, maybe substitution. Let me try substitution. Let t = sin x. Then dt = cos x dx. But the denominator is cos²x, so we can write the integral as ∫ ln(sin x) / cos²x dx. Let's express cos²x as 1 - sin²x. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, express 1/cos²x as sec²x, which is the derivative of tan x. Hmm, which is what we did before. So maybe the integration by parts is correct.

Alternatively, let's check with numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically to see if it's approximately -π/2 ≈ -1.5707963268. Let me compute a numerical approximation. Let's take x = π/4, ln(sin(π/4)) = ln(√2/2) ≈ -0.34657359. cos²(π/4) = (√2/2)^2 = 0.5. So the integrand at π/4 is -0.34657359 / 0.5 ≈ -0.69314718. The integral from 0 to π/2 of a function, which is negative throughout, and the result is -π/2. Let me check with another point. Maybe x approaching 0. For x near 0, ln(sin x) ≈ ln x, and cos²x ≈ 1. So the integrand ≈ ln x, which tends to -infinity, but the integral of ln x from 0 to a is convergent. Wait, but in our case, the integral is ∫ ln x / 1 dx near 0, which would be x ln x - x, evaluated from 0 to a. As x approaches 0, x ln x approaches 0, so the integral near 0 is finite. So the integral is indeed convergent. So if the integration by parts gives -π/2, which is approximately -1.5708, but let's check with a simple numerical integration.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me try substitution t = π/2 - x. Then when x = 0, t = π/2; x = π/2, t = 0. The integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^0 [ln(sin(π/2 - t))]/cos²(π/2 - t) (-dt) = ∫₀^{π/2} [ln(cos t)] / sin²t dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. But maybe this integral is similar to the original one. Let me denote the original integral as I. Then, using substitution t = π/2 - x, we have I = ∫₀^{π/2} [ln(cos t)] / sin²t dt. So I is equal to both ∫ [ln(sin x)]/cos²x dx and ∫ [ln(cos t)]/sin²t dt. Maybe adding them together? Let's see:

I + I = ∫₀^{π/2} [ln(sin x)]/cos²x dx + ∫₀^{π/2} [ln(cos x)]/sin²x dx. Hmm, but I don't see an obvious way to combine these. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, consider expanding ln(sin x) as a Fourier series or using known integrals. Wait, I recall that ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin x) dx = - (π/2) ln 2. But here, the integrand is different because of the division by cos²x. Maybe differentiation under the integral sign. Let me consider a parameter. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin x) * sec²x dx. Wait, but how to introduce a parameter here. Alternatively, consider integrating with respect to a parameter that's in the exponent. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe substitution u = tan x. Let me try that. Let u = tan x. Then x = arctan u, dx = du/(1 + u²). When x = 0, u = 0; x = π/2, u approaches infinity. Then sin x = u / sqrt(1 + u²). So ln(sin x) = ln(u) - (1/2) ln(1 + u²). The integrand becomes [ln(u) - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] * (1 + u²) * [du/(1 + u²)]. Wait, because cos²x = 1/(1 + u²), so 1/cos²x = 1 + u². Therefore, the integrand is [ln(u) - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] * (1 + u²) * [du/(1 + u²)] = [ln(u) - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] du. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ln u - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] du. Hmm, but this integral from 0 to infinity might be divergent. Let's check the behavior as u approaches infinity. The integrand is ln u - (1/2) ln(1 + u²) ≈ ln u - (1/2)(2 ln u) = ln u - ln u = 0. So maybe it converges? Wait, but let's see:

As u approaches infinity, ln(1 + u²) ≈ 2 ln u, so the integrand is ln u - (1/2)(2 ln u) = 0. So the integrand tends to 0. But what about the integral from 1 to infinity? Let's see, the integrand is ln u - ln u = 0. Wait, but that's only asymptotically. Actually, ln(1 + u²) = 2 ln u + ln(1 + 1/u²) ≈ 2 ln u for large u. So the integrand is ln u - (1/2)(2 ln u + ln(1 + 1/u²)) ≈ - (1/2) ln(1 + 1/u²) ≈ - (1/2)(1/u²) for large u. So the integrand behaves like -1/(2u²) for large u, which is integrable. Similarly, near u = 0, ln u tends to -infinity, but let's check the behavior. As u approaches 0, ln u ~ -infty, but the integrand is ln u - (1/2) ln(1 + u²) ≈ ln u - (1/2)(u²) ≈ ln u. So the integral near 0 is ∫ ln u du, which is u ln u - u. As u approaches 0, u ln u approaches 0, so the integral near 0 converges. Therefore, the integral is convergent. But integrating [ln u - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] from 0 to infinity. Let's split the integral into two parts: ∫₀^∞ ln u du - (1/2) ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + u²) du. However, ∫₀^∞ ln u du is divergent, but the combination might converge. Wait, but this seems contradictory. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the integrand behaves like -1/(2u²) for large u, which is integrable. So maybe the combination converges. Let me compute the integral.

Let me compute ∫₀^∞ [ln u - (1/2) ln(1 + u²)] du. Let's split it into two integrals:

I1 = ∫₀^∞ ln u du

I2 = ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + u²) du

Then the original integral is I1 - (1/2) I2.

But I1 is divergent. However, the combination might be finite. Wait, but how? If I1 is divergent and I2 is also divergent, but their combination might be finite. Let's check:

Compute I1 - (1/2) I2. If I1 and I2 are both divergent, but their combination converges. Let's see:

But I1 is ∫₀^∞ ln u du. Let's consider integrating from 0 to A:

∫₀^A ln u du = u ln u - u |₀^A = A ln A - A - (0 - 0) = A ln A - A.

As A approaches infinity, this diverges to infinity. Similarly, I2 = ∫₀^∞ ln(1 + u²) du. Let's compute ∫₀^A ln(1 + u²) du. Integration by parts: let v = ln(1 + u²), dw = du. Then dv = (2u)/(1 + u²) du, w = u. So ∫v dw = uv - ∫w dv = u ln(1 + u²) - ∫ (2u²)/(1 + u²) du. The integral becomes 2 ∫ [ (u² + 1 - 1)/(1 + u²) ] du = 2 ∫1 du - 2 ∫1/(1 + u²) du = 2u - 2 arctan u. So the integral from 0 to A is [u ln(1 + u²) - 2u + 2 arctan u] from 0 to A. At A: A ln(1 + A²) - 2A + 2 arctan A. At 0: 0 - 0 + 0 = 0. So as A approaches infinity, ln(1 + A²) ≈ 2 ln A, so A * 2 ln A - 2A + 2*(π/2) = 2A ln A - 2A + π. Therefore, I2 diverges as A approaches infinity. 

So I1 - (1/2) I2 would be (A ln A - A) - (1/2)(2A ln A - 2A + π) = A ln A - A - A ln A + A - π/2 = -π/2. So the divergent terms cancel out, leaving -π/2. Therefore, the original integral is indeed -π/2. So this confirms the result from the integration by parts. Therefore, the exact answer is -π/2. 

Now, the numerical approximation. The exact value is -π/2 ≈ -1.5707963267948966. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's -1.5707963268. 

But wait, let me verify with a numerical integration. Let's approximate the integral numerically. For example, using Simpson's rule or another method. Let's take a few points. For example, at x = π/4, the integrand is ln(sin(π/4))/cos²(π/4) = ln(√2/2)/( (√2/2)^2 ) = ln(1/√2) / (1/2) = (- (1/2) ln 2) / (1/2) = -ln 2 ≈ -0.693147. At x = π/6, sin(π/6) = 1/2, cos²(π/6) = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4. So integrand is ln(1/2) / (3/4) = (-ln 2) * (4/3) ≈ -0.693147 * 1.333333 ≈ -0.924196. At x = π/3, sin(π/3) = √3/2, cos²(π/3) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Integrand is ln(√3/2) / (1/4) = (ln √3 - ln 2) * 4 = (0.5 ln 3 - ln 2) *4 ≈ (0.5493 - 0.6931) *4 ≈ (-0.1438)*4 ≈ -0.5752. 

So the function is negative throughout, and the integral is the area under the curve. The exact answer is -π/2 ≈ -1.5708. Let's approximate the integral numerically. Let's use a simple trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. For example, divide the interval 0 to π/2 into n=4 intervals. The width h = (π/2)/4 ≈ 0.3927. The points are x0=0, x1=0.3927, x2=0.7854 (π/4), x3=1.1781, x4=1.5708 (π/2). Compute the integrand at these points:

At x0=0: integrand is ln(0)/1, which is -infinity. But near 0=0, the integrand behaves like ln(x)/1, so the function approaches -infinity, but the integral converges. To handle this, maybe use substitution near 0. Alternatively, use a substitution u = x, and integrate from a small ε to π/2, then take ε→0. Let's approximate with ε=0.001. Then compute the integral from 0=0.001 to π/2. Let's compute the integrand at x=0.001: sin(0.001) ≈ 0.00099999983, ln(sin x) ≈ ln(0.001) ≈ -6.907755278. cos²x ≈ 1. So integrand ≈ -6.907755278. At x=0.3927 (π/8): sin(0.3927) ≈ 0.382683, ln(0.382683) ≈ -0.96017, cos²x ≈ cos²(0.3927) ≈ 0.853553, so integrand ≈ -0.96017 / 0.853553 ≈ -1.125. At x=0.7854 (π/4): integrand ≈ -0.693147 / 0.5 ≈ -1.386294. At x=1.1781 (3π/8): sin(1.1781) ≈ 0.92388, ln(0.92388) ≈ -0.07914, cos²x ≈ cos²(1.1781) ≈ 0.146447, so integrand ≈ -0.07914 / 0.146447 ≈ -0.540. At x=1.5708 (π/2): integrand approaches 0 as before. 

Using trapezoidal rule with these points (from 0.001 to π/2):

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, use a calculator or computational tool. But since I can't do that here, I'll rely on the analytical result. Since the integration by parts and substitution both lead to -π/2, and the numerical approximation of that is approximately -1.5707963268, which matches the exact value. Therefore, the answer is confirmed.
