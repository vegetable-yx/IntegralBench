Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of (5x³ - 3x) squared from -1 to 1. Hmm, first step is probably expanding the square so that I can integrate term by term. Let me start by expanding (5x³ - 3x)². 

So, expanding that, it should be (5x³)² minus twice the product of 5x³ and 3x, plus (3x)². Let me check: (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². Right. 

Calculating each part:
- (5x³)² is 25x⁶.
- The middle term is 2*(5x³)*(3x) = 2*15x⁴ = 30x⁴, but wait, with a negative sign, so -30x⁴.
- (3x)² is 9x².

So the integrand becomes 25x⁶ - 30x⁴ + 9x². Now, I need to integrate each term from -1 to 1.

Let me write the integral as the sum of three integrals:
∫ from -1 to 1 of 25x⁶ dx - ∫ from -1 to 1 of 30x⁴ dx + ∫ from -1 to 1 of 9x² dx.

But since integrating over a symmetric interval (-a to a), maybe I can check if the functions are even or odd. Wait, each term here: x⁶ is even, x⁴ is even, x² is even. So all terms are even functions. Therefore, the entire integrand is even. That means I can compute the integral from 0 to 1 and multiply by 2. But maybe I don't make a mistake here, but let's proceed step by step.

Alternatively, compute each integral directly. Let's do that.

First term: 25∫x⁶ dx from -1 to 1. The integral of x⁶ is (x⁷)/7. Evaluated from -1 to 1: (1⁷/7 - (-1)⁷/7) = (1/7 - (-1)/7) = 2/7. Multiply by 25: 25*(2/7) = 50/7.

Second term: -30∫x⁴ dx from -1 to 1. Integral of x⁴ is x⁵/5. Evaluated from -1 to 1: (1⁵/5 - (-1)^5/5) = (1/5 - (-1)/5) = 2/5. Multiply by -30: -30*(2/5) = -12.

Third term: 9∫x² dx from -1 to 1. Integral of x² is x³/3. Evaluated from -1 to 1: (1³/3 - (-1)^3/3) = (1/3 - (-1)/3) = 2/3. Multiply by 9: 9*(2/3) = 6.

Now, sum all three terms: 50/7 -12 +6. Let's compute that. 50/7 is approximately 7.142857. Then subtract 12 gives 7.142857 -12 = -4.857143, then add 6: -4.857143 +6 = 1.142857. But let's do it in fractions.

50/7 -12 +6 = 50/7 -6. Because 12 -6 is 6, so 50/7 -6. Convert 6 to 42/7. So 50/7 -42/7 = 8/7. Wait, that's different. Wait, 50/7 -12 +6 is 50/7 -6. 50/7 is approximately 7.142857, minus 6 is 1.142857, which is 8/7. Because 8/7 is approximately 1.142857. So the exact answer is 8/7. Hmm, that seems right.

Wait, let me check the calculations again. Let's do each term step by step.

First term: 25*(1/7 - (-1)^7/7) = 25*(1/7 +1/7) = 25*(2/7) = 50/7.

Second term: -30*(1/5 - (-1)^5/5) = -30*(1/5 +1/5) = -30*(2/5) = -12.

Third term: 9*(1/3 - (-1)^3/3) = 9*(1/3 +1/3) = 9*(2/3) = 6.

So total integral is 50/7 -12 +6. So 50/7 -6. 6 is 42/7, so 50/7 -42/7 = 8/7. So exact answer is 8/7. That's approximately 1.142857142857...

So the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places would be 1.1428571429. Wait, 8 divided by 7 is 1.142857142857..., so rounding to 10 decimal places: 1.1428571429.

Wait, let me check: 8 ÷ 7. 7 goes into 8 once, remainder 1. Then 1.1428571428... So the decimal repeats every 6 digits: 142857. So 1.142857142857... So up to 10 decimal places: 1.1428571428 (since the 11th digit is 5, which would round up the 10th). Wait, 8/7 is 1.\overline{142857}. So:

1.142857142857142857...

So first 10 decimal places: 1.1428571428 (positions 1-10 after decimal: 1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8). Wait, let's count:

1.1 4 2 8 5 7 1 4 2 8 5 7...

So positions 1-10 after decimal: 1,4,2,8,5,7,1,4,2,8. So the 10th decimal is 8, and the next digit is 5 (from the 11th position). So when rounding to 10 decimal places, if the 11th digit is 5, we round up the 10th. So 8 becomes 9. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1.1428571429.

Wait, let me confirm with actual division. 8 divided by 7:

7 into 8 is 1, remainder 1. 1.0

7 into 10 is 1, remainder 3. 1.1

7 into 30 is 4, remainder 2. 1.14

7 into 20 is 2, remainder 6. 1.142

7 into 60 is 8, remainder 4. 1.1428

7 into 40 is 5, remainder 5. 1.14285

7 into 50 is 7, remainder 1. 1.142857

7 into 10 is 1, remainder 3. 1.1428571

7 into 30 is 4, remainder 2. 1.14285714

7 into 20 is 2, remainder 6. 1.142857142

7 into 60 is 8, remainder 4. 1.1428571428

7 into 40 is 5, remainder 5. 1.14285714285...

So up to 10 decimal places, it's 1.1428571428, but the 11th digit is 5, so we round up the 10th digit (8) to 9. Therefore, 1.1428571429.

So the exact answer is 8/7, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.1428571429.

Let me just verify once more that the integral was correct. Expanding (5x³ -3x)^2 gives 25x^6 -30x^4 +9x^2. Integrating term by term from -1 to 1:

For x^6: integral is (x^7)/7 from -1 to 1. Since x^7 is odd, but when we take the definite integral from -1 to 1, it's [1/7 - (-1)/7] = 2/7. Multiply by 25: 50/7.

For x^4: integral is (x^5)/5 from -1 to 1. Again, x^5 is odd, so [1/5 - (-1)/5] = 2/5. Multiply by -30: -12.

For x^2: integral is (x^3)/3 from -1 to 1. x^3 is odd, so [1/3 - (-1)/3] = 2/3. Multiply by 9: 6.

Adding them up: 50/7 -12 +6 = 50/7 -6 = 50/7 -42/7 = 8/7. Yep, that's correct. So the exact answer is 8/7, and the numerical is approximately 1.1428571429.
