Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of (5x³ - 3x) squared from -1 to 1. Hmm, first step is probably expanding the square inside the integral. Let me write that out. So, (5x³ - 3x)². Expanding that would be 25x⁶ minus 30x⁴ plus 9x². Wait, let me check: (a - b)² is a² - 2ab + b². So, (5x³)² is 25x⁶, then 2ab is 2*(5x³)*(3x) which is 30x⁴, so minus 30x⁴, and then (3x)² is 9x². Yeah, so the integrand becomes 25x⁶ - 30x⁴ + 9x².

Now, the integral from -1 to 1 of that expression. Since it's a polynomial, I can integrate term by term. Let's break it down. The integral of 25x⁶ dx is 25*(x⁷/7), right? Then the integral of -30x⁴ is -30*(x⁵/5), and the integral of 9x² is 9*(x³/3). So putting it all together, the antiderivative should be (25/7)x⁷ - 6x⁵ + 3x³. Then evaluate that from -1 to 1.

Wait, but before I proceed, maybe I should check if the function is even or odd. Because integrating from -1 to 1 might have some symmetry. Let's see, the original function is (5x³ -3x)². Since squaring makes it even, because any function squared is even. So the integrand is even. Therefore, the integral from -1 to 1 is twice the integral from 0 to 1. That might simplify calculations, but maybe I can proceed either way.

But let's just go through the standard way. So compute F(1) - F(-1). Let's compute F(1) first. Plugging in x=1: (25/7)(1)^7 -6*(1)^5 +3*(1)^3 = 25/7 -6 +3. Let's compute that. 25/7 is approximately 3.571, but exact fractions are better. 25/7 -6 +3 = 25/7 -3. Because 6-3 is 3, but wait, no: 25/7 -6 +3 = 25/7 -3. So 25/7 - 21/7 = 4/7. Hmm, that's F(1).

Now F(-1): (25/7)*(-1)^7 -6*(-1)^5 +3*(-1)^3. Let's compute each term. (-1)^7 is -1, so 25/7*(-1) = -25/7. Then -6*(-1)^5: (-1)^5 is -1, so -6*(-1) = 6. Then 3*(-1)^3 is 3*(-1) = -3. So adding those up: -25/7 +6 -3. 6-3 is 3, so -25/7 +3 = -25/7 +21/7 = -4/7.

Therefore, F(1) - F(-1) is 4/7 - (-4/7) = 8/7. So the exact value is 8/7. Let me check that again. Wait, when I computed F(1) as 25/7 -6 +3. 25/7 is 3 and 4/7. 3 and 4/7 minus 6 is negative 2 and 3/7, plus 3 would be 0 and 4/7. So 4/7. Then F(-1) is -25/7 +6 -3. -25/7 is -3 and 4/7. Adding 6 gives 2 and 3/7. Subtracting 3 gives -0 and 4/7. So -4/7. Then 4/7 - (-4/7) is 8/7. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, using symmetry: since the integrand is even, the integral from -1 to 1 is 2 times the integral from 0 to 1. Let's check that. Compute 2 = 2*[integral from 0 to1 of 25x⁶ -30x⁴ +9x² dx]. The antiderivative evaluated at 1 is 25/7 -6 +3 = 4/7, and at 0 is 0. So 2*(4/7) = 8/7. Same result. So that's correct.

So the exact answer is 8/7. Then the numerical approximation. 8 divided by 7 is approximately 1.142857142857... So rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.1428571429. Let me confirm: 7*1.1428571428 = 7*1 +7*0.1428571428. 0.1428571428*7 is approximately 0.9999999996, so total 7.9999999996, which is almost 8. So yes, 1.1428571429.

So the final answer should be {"answer": "\\dfrac{8}{7}", "numerical_answer": "1.1428571429"}.
