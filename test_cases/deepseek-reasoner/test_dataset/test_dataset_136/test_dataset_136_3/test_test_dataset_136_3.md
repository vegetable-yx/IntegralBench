Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is ∫ from 0 to 2 of x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(1/2)[1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^(1/2) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it.

First, let me rewrite the integrand to see if I can spot any patterns. The integrand is x^{-1/2} times (2 - x)^{1/2} times [1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2}. Let me simplify the expression inside the square roots. The term 0.5x(2 - x) can be expanded. Let's compute that: 0.5x(2 - x) = x - 0.5x². So, 1 - 0.5x(2 - x) becomes 1 - x + 0.5x². Wait, maybe that's a quadratic in x. Let me check: 0.5x² - x + 1. Hmm, perhaps completing the square? Let's see:

0.5x² - x + 1 = 0.5(x² - 2x) + 1 = 0.5(x² - 2x + 1 - 1) + 1 = 0.5(x - 1)^2 - 0.5 + 1 = 0.5(x - 1)^2 + 0.5. So, 1 - 0.5x(2 - x) = 0.5(x - 1)^2 + 0.5. That's 0.5[(x - 1)^2 + 1]. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution to make the integral symmetric. The limits are from 0 to 2. Let me try substituting x = 2 sin²θ or something trigonometric. Wait, another approach: since the integral is from 0 to 2, maybe a substitution like t = x/2, which would make the interval from 0 to 1. Let's try that. Let t = x/2, so x = 2t, dx = 2dt. Then the integral becomes:

∫ from t=0 to t=1 of (2t)^{-1/2} (2 - 2t)^{1/2} [1 - 0.5*(2t)(2 - 2t)]^{1/2} * 2 dt.

Simplify each term:

(2t)^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} t^{-1/2}

(2 - 2t)^{1/2} = (2(1 - t))^{1/2} = 2^{1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2}

The third term: 1 - 0.5*(2t)(2 - 2t) = 1 - 0.5*(4t - 4t²) = 1 - 2t + 2t². So [1 - 2t + 2t²]^{1/2}

Putting it all together:

2^{ -1/2 } * 2^{1/2} * 2 * ∫ t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} [1 - 2t + 2t²]^{1/2} dt

The constants: 2^{-1/2 + 1/2} * 2 = 2^0 * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2. So the integral becomes 2 ∫ from 0 to1 t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^{1/2} [1 - 2t + 2t²]^{1/2} dt.

Hmm, not sure if that's better. Let me check the expression under the square root: 1 - 2t + 2t². Let's complete the square here. 2t² - 2t +1 = 2(t² - t) +1 = 2(t² - t + 1/4 - 1/4) +1 = 2(t - 0.5)^2 - 0.5 +1 = 2(t - 0.5)^2 + 0.5. So, 1 - 2t + 2t² = 2(t - 0.5)^2 + 0.5. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me think about the original integrand again: x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{1/2}[1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2}. Let me compute 0.5x(2 - x) = x(2 - x)/2. So 1 - x(2 - x)/2. Let's compute that: 1 - (2x - x²)/2 = 1 - x + (x²)/2. So the term under the square root is 1 - x + (x²)/2. Wait, that's the same as (x² - 2x + 2)/2. Which is (x² - 2x +1 +1)/2 = ((x -1)^2 +1)/2. So sqrt( ((x -1)^2 +1)/2 ). So the integrand becomes x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{1/2} sqrt( ((x -1)^2 +1)/2 ). Hmm, maybe that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like u = x -1, shifting the variable. Let u = x -1, then x = u +1, dx = du. The limits from x=0 to x=2 become u=-1 to u=1. Then the integrand becomes (u +1)^{-1/2} (2 - (u +1))^{1/2} sqrt( (u² +1)/2 ). Simplify:

(2 - u -1) = (1 - u), so (1 - u)^{1/2}

So the integrand is (u +1)^{-1/2} (1 - u)^{1/2} sqrt( (u² +1)/2 ) du. Hmm, integrating from u=-1 to u=1. Maybe this symmetry can help. Let's check if the integrand is even or odd. Let's substitute u by -u:

For u in (-1,1), replace u with -u:

(u +1) becomes (-u +1) = (1 - u)

(1 - u) becomes (1 + u)

sqrt( (u² +1)/2 ) remains the same since u² is same as (-u)^2.

So the integrand becomes (1 - u)^{-1/2} (1 + u)^{1/2} sqrt( (u² +1)/2 ). Comparing to original, which was (u +1)^{-1/2} (1 - u)^{1/2} sqrt( (u² +1)/2 ). So swapping (1 - u) and (1 + u) terms. So the integrand is not even, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a trigonometric substitution. Let me think. The term x^{-1/2} suggests maybe substituting t = sqrt(x), but let's see. Let t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the integral becomes:

∫ from t=0 to t=sqrt(2) of (t²)^{-1/2} (2 - t²)^{1/2} [1 - 0.5 t²(2 - t²)]^{1/2} * 2t dt.

Simplify:

(t²)^{-1/2} = t^{-1}

(2 - t²)^{1/2} remains as is.

The third term: 1 - 0.5 t²(2 - t²) = 1 - t² + 0.5 t^4. So sqrt(1 - t² + 0.5 t^4)

Multiply by 2t:

So the integrand becomes 2t * t^{-1} (2 - t²)^{1/2} sqrt(1 - t² + 0.5 t^4) dt = 2 (2 - t²)^{1/2} sqrt(1 - t² + 0.5 t^4) dt. Hmm, not sure if that's better.

Alternatively, maybe hypergeometric substitution or recognizing the integral as a Beta function or elliptic integral. The presence of multiple square roots might indicate an elliptic integral. Let me check the integrand again.

Original integrand: x^{-1/2} (2 - x) )^{1/2} [1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2}

Let me compute the product of the square roots:

(2 - x)^{1/2} [1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2} = sqrt{(2 - x)(1 - 0.5x(2 - x))}

Let me compute the expression inside:

(2 - x)(1 - 0.5x(2 - x)) = (2 - x) - 0.5x(2 - x)^2

Let me expand that:

First term: (2 - x)

Second term: -0.5x(4 -4x +x²) = -0.5x*4 +0.5x*4x -0.5x*x² = -2x + 2x² -0.5x³

So overall, (2 - x) -2x +2x² -0.5x³ = 2 -x -2x +2x² -0.5x³ = 2 -3x +2x² -0.5x³

Hmm, not sure. Maybe this approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the entire integrand:

x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{1/2} [1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2} = x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{1/2} sqrt{1 - 0.5x(2 - x)}

Let me write 0.5x(2 - x) as x(2 - x)/2. So 1 - x(2 - x)/2. Let me compute that:

1 - [2x -x²]/2 = 1 -x + x²/2. So the integrand becomes:

x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{1/2} sqrt{1 -x + x²/2}

Hmm, maybe another substitution. Let me try substituting t = x -1, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe a substitution that can turn the square root into something simpler. Let me check the expression under the square root: 1 -x + x²/2. Let's see if this is a perfect square. Let's check:

x²/2 -x +1 = (x² -2x +2)/2. The discriminant of x² -2x +2 is 4 -8 = -4, so it doesn't factor into real terms. So maybe not a perfect square. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like x = 2 sin²θ. Let's try that. Let x = 2 sin²θ, so when x=0, θ=0; x=2, θ=π/2. Then dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Let's substitute into the integrand:

x^{-1/2} = (2 sin²θ)^{-1/2} = (2)^{-1/2} (sinθ)^{-1}

(2 - x)^{1/2} = (2 - 2 sin²θ)^{1/2} = sqrt{2 cos²θ} = sqrt{2} cosθ

[1 -0.5x(2 -x)]^{1/2} = [1 -0.5*(2 sin²θ)(2 - 2 sin²θ)]^{1/2}

Compute inside:

0.5*(2 sin²θ)(2 - 2 sin²θ) = 0.5*2 sin²θ*2(1 - sin²θ) = 0.5*4 sin²θ cos²θ = 2 sin²θ cos²θ

So 1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ. Therefore, sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ}

Putting it all together:

Integral becomes:

(2)^{-1/2} (sinθ)^{-1} * sqrt{2} cosθ * sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ} * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify constants:

(2^{-1/2} * sqrt{2)) = 2^{-1/2 +1/2} = 2^0 =1

The sinθ^{-1} * sinθ = 1

So we have 1 * cosθ * sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ} *4 cosθ dθ

So 4 cos²θ sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ} dθ

Hmm, that's 4 ∫ cos²θ sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ} dθ from θ=0 to θ=π/2.

This still looks complicated. Let me see if the term under the square root can be simplified. Let's compute 1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ. Note that sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so sin²θ cos²θ = (sin2θ / 2)^2. So 2 sin²θ cos²θ = (sin²2θ)/2. Therefore, 1 - (sin²2θ)/2. So sqrt{1 - (sin²2θ)/2}. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use a double-angle identity. Let me set φ = 2θ. Then when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. But the integral becomes more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe express cos²θ in terms of sin. Let me write cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ. Then the expression under the square root becomes 1 - 2 sin²θ (1 - sin²θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ + 2 sin^4θ. Hmm, but that's a quartic. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use a substitution like t = sinθ. Let t = sinθ, then dt = cosθ dθ. But when θ goes from 0 to π/2, t goes from 0 to 1. Let's try that. Then cosθ = sqrt(1 - t²), dθ = dt / sqrt(1 - t²). The integral becomes:

4 ∫ cos²θ sqrt{1 - 2 t² cos²θ} * (dt / sqrt(1 - t²)) )

But cosθ = sqrt(1 - t²), so cos²θ = 1 - t². Then:

4 ∫ (1 - t²) sqrt{1 - 2 t² (1 - t²)} * (1 / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt

Simplify:

4 ∫ sqrt(1 - t²) * sqrt{1 - 2 t² (1 - t²)} dt

= 4 ∫ sqrt{(1 - t²)(1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4)} dt

Hmm, the expression inside the square root is (1 - t²)(1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4). Let me expand this:

Multiply (1 - t²) and (1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4):

= 1*(1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4) - t²*(1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4)

= 1 - 2 t² + 2 t^4 - t² + 2 t^4 - 2 t^6

Combine like terms:

1 -3 t² +4 t^4 -2 t^6

So the integral becomes 4 ∫ sqrt{1 -3 t² +4 t^4 -2 t^6} dt from t=0 to t=1. That seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Let me think if there's another substitution. Let's go back to the original integral:

∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{1/2} [1 - 0.5x(2 - x)]^{1/2} dx

Let me consider the substitution u = x(2 - x). Let's see:

u = x(2 - x) = 2x -x²

Then du/dx = 2 - 2x. Hmm, but the integrand has x^{-1/2} (2 -x)^{1/2} and sqrt(1 -0.5u). Not sure if this helps. Let's see:

Express the integrand in terms of u:

x^{-1/2} (2 -x)^{1/2} = [x(2 -x)]^{-1/2} (2 -x)^{1} = u^{-1/2} (2 -x)

But 2 -x = (2 -x), which is related to u. Since u = 2x -x², then 2 -x = (2x -x²)/x + x? Not sure. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try substitution t = sqrt(x/(2 -x)). Let's see:

t = sqrt(x/(2 -x)) => t² = x/(2 -x) => x = t²(2 -x) => x = 2 t² -x t² => x(1 + t²) = 2 t² => x = (2 t²)/(1 + t²)

Then dx/dt = [4t(1 + t²) - 2 t³]/(1 + t²)^2 = [4t +4 t³ -2 t³]/(1 + t²)^2 = [4t +2 t³]/(1 + t²)^2 = 2t(2 + t²)/(1 + t²)^2

The limits: when x=0, t=0; x=2, t approaches infinity. Hmm, but integrating to infinity might not be helpful. Let's see the integrand in terms of t:

x^{-1/2} = [ (2 t²)/(1 + t²) ]^{-1/2} = (1 + t²)^{1/2}/(sqrt{2} t)

(2 -x)^{1/2} = [2 - (2 t²)/(1 + t²)]^{1/2} = [ (2(1 + t²) -2 t² )/(1 + t²) ]^{1/2} = [2/(1 + t²)]^{1/2} = sqrt{2}/(1 + t²)^{1/2}

[1 -0.5x(2 -x)]^{1/2} = [1 -0.5*(2 t²/(1 + t²))*(2/(1 + t²))]^{1/2} = [1 -0.5*(4 t²)/(1 + t²)^2]^{1/2} = [1 - 2 t²/(1 + t²)^2]^{1/2}

So the integrand becomes:

(1 + t²)^{1/2}/(sqrt{2} t) * sqrt{2}/(1 + t²)^{1/2} * sqrt{1 - 2 t²/(1 + t²)^2} * dx/dt

Simplify:

The sqrt{2} cancels with 1/sqrt{2}, and (1 + t²)^{1/2} cancels with 1/(1 + t²)^{1/2}, leaving:

1/t * sqrt{1 - 2 t²/(1 + t²)^2} * 2t(2 + t²)/(1 + t²)^2 dt

Simplify term by term:

1/t * 2t = 2

So the integrand becomes 2 * sqrt{1 - 2 t²/(1 + t²)^2} * (2 + t²)/(1 + t²)^2 dt

Now, the term inside the square root:

1 - 2 t²/(1 + t²)^2 = [ (1 + t²)^2 - 2 t² ] / (1 + t²)^2 = [1 + 2 t² + t^4 - 2 t²]/(1 + t²)^2 = (1 + t^4)/(1 + t²)^2

So sqrt{(1 + t^4)/(1 + t²)^2} = sqrt{1 + t^4}/(1 + t²)

Therefore, the integrand becomes:

2 * [sqrt{1 + t^4}/(1 + t²)] * (2 + t²)/(1 + t²)^2 dt = 2 sqrt{1 + t^4} (2 + t²) / (1 + t²)^3 dt

So the integral is now 2 ∫ from t=0 to t=∞ sqrt{1 + t^4} (2 + t²)/(1 + t²)^3 dt. Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe there's a substitution here. Let me check if this integral is a standard form or can be related to a Beta function or something else.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution like u = t². Let u = t², then t = sqrt(u), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du. Then the integral becomes:

2 ∫ from u=0 to u=∞ sqrt{1 + u²} (2 + u)/(1 + u)^3 * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du

= ∫ from 0 to ∞ sqrt{1 + u²} (2 + u)/(1 + u)^3 * (1/sqrt(u)) du

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe another substitution. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps this integral can be expressed in terms of the Beta function or Gamma function. But the presence of sqrt(1 + t^4) complicates things. Alternatively, maybe expanding in a series. Let me check if the integral can be expressed in terms of known constants.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution v = t + 1/t. Not sure. Let me think.

Wait, going back to the original problem. Maybe there's a geometric interpretation. The integrand resembles the formula for the circumference of an ellipse or something similar. Alternatively, maybe parametrizing a curve.

Alternatively, let's consider if the integral is related to the Beta function. The Beta function is ∫₀¹ t^{c-1} (1 - t)^{d-1} dt, but our integral has more complex terms. Alternatively, maybe after substitution, it can be expressed in terms of Beta or Gamma functions.

Alternatively, let's consider numerical evaluation. The problem asks for an exact answer and a numerical approximation. If I can't find an analytical solution, maybe I can at least compute the numerical approximation. But the user also wants the exact answer, so I need to find a way to compute it analytically.

Wait, let me check the original integrand again. Let me compute the integral numerically first to see if it's a known value. Let's approximate the integral using substitution or known methods.

Alternatively, maybe the integral is equal to π/2 or something similar. Let me test with x=1, which is the midpoint. The integrand at x=1 is 1^{-1/2}*(1)^{1/2}*[1 -0.5*1)*(1)]^{1/2} =1*1*sqrt{1 -0.5} = sqrt(0.5) ≈0.707. The integral from 0 to 2 of this function. Let me approximate it numerically using Simpson's rule or another method.

But since I need to provide an exact answer, perhaps there's a substitution I'm missing. Let me think again.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = x(2 -x). Then, as before, u = x(2 -x). The maximum of u is at x=1, u=1*(2-1)=1. So u ranges from 0 to1. Let's try this substitution.

Let u = x(2 -x). Then du/dx = 2 - 2x. So dx = du/(2 - 2x). But x is expressed in terms of u. Let's solve for x in terms of u:

u = 2x -x² => x² -2x +u=0 => x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4u)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 -u)

Since x is between 0 and2, when u increases from 0 to1, x goes from 0 to1 and then back to2. So we need to split the integral into two parts. But this complicates things. Alternatively, express x in terms of u.

But maybe this substitution is not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider the integral in terms of u = sqrt(x(2 -x)). Let u = sqrt(x(2 -x)), so u² = x(2 -x). Then, differentiating both sides: 2u du = (2 -2x) dx => dx = (2u du)/(2 -2x). But x(2 -x) =u², so 2 -x = (u²)/x. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution t = sqrt(x/(2 -x)) as before, but I tried that and it led to a complicated integral.

Wait, going back to the substitution x = 2 sin²θ. After substitution, the integral became 4 ∫ cos²θ sqrt{1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ} dθ from 0 to π/2. Let me try to simplify the expression under the square root:

1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ = 1 - (sin²2θ)/2. Because sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ, so sin²2θ =4 sin²θ cos²θ. Therefore, 1 - (sin²2θ)/2 = 1 - (sin²2θ)/2. So sqrt{1 - (sin²2θ)/2} = sqrt{ (2 - sin²2θ)/2 } = sqrt{ (1 + cos²2θ)/2 }, since 2 - sin²2θ = 1 + cos²2θ.

Therefore, the integral becomes 4 ∫ cos²θ sqrt{ (1 + cos²2θ)/2 } dθ. Let's simplify sqrt{(1 + cos²2θ)/2}. Hmm, not sure. Maybe use a double-angle identity. Let me recall that cos²2θ = (1 + cos4θ)/2. So:

sqrt{ (1 + (1 + cos4θ)/2 ) /2 } = sqrt{ ( (2 +1 + cos4θ)/2 ) /2 } = sqrt{ (3 + cos4θ)/4 } = (1/2) sqrt{3 + cos4θ}

So the integral becomes 4 * (1/2) ∫ cos²θ sqrt{3 + cos4θ} dθ = 2 ∫ cos²θ sqrt{3 + cos4θ} dθ from 0 to π/2.

Hmm, still complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let φ = 2θ, so when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. Then dφ = 2 dθ, so dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes:

2 ∫ cos²(φ/2) sqrt{3 + cos2φ} * (dφ/2) from φ=0 to φ=π

= ∫ cos²(φ/2) sqrt{3 + cos2φ} dφ from 0 to π

Using the identity cos²(φ/2) = (1 + cosφ)/2, so:

= ∫ (1 + cosφ)/2 * sqrt{3 + cos2φ} dφ from 0 to π

= (1/2) ∫ (1 + cosφ) sqrt{3 + cos2φ} dφ from 0 to π

Hmm, maybe expand cos2φ in terms of cosφ. Cos2φ = 2cos²φ -1. So 3 + cos2φ = 3 +2cos²φ -1 = 2 +2cos²φ = 2(1 + cos²φ). So sqrt{3 + cos2φ} = sqrt{2(1 + cos²φ)} = sqrt{2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ}

So the integral becomes (1/2) * sqrt{2} ∫ (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ from 0 to π

= (sqrt{2}/2) ∫ (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ from 0 to π

= (1/sqrt{2}) ∫ (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ from 0 to π

This still seems complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me set t = φ, but not sure. Alternatively, use symmetry. The integral from 0 to π of (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ. Let me check if the integrand is even or odd around φ=π/2. Not sure. Alternatively, split the integral into two parts: 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Let me substitute φ = π - t in the second part.

Let’s split the integral:

I = ∫₀^π (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} ... dφ + ∫_{π/2}^π ... dφ

In the second integral, let φ = π - t, then when φ=π/2, t=π/2; φ=π, t=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{π/2}^π (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} (1 + cos(π - t)) sqrt{1 + cos²(π - t)} (-dt)

But cos(π - t) = -cos t, and cos²(π - t) = cos²t. So:

= ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos t) sqrt{1 + cos²t} dt

Therefore, the original integral I becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} (1 + cosφ) sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ + ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cos t) sqrt{1 + cos²t} dt

= ∫₀^{π/2} [ (1 + cosφ) + (1 - cosφ) ] sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ

= ∫₀^{π/2} 2 sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ

So the integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ

Therefore, the original integral after substitutions is (1/sqrt{2}) * I = (1/sqrt{2}) * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ = sqrt{2} ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ

Hmm, this integral ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ is known to be related to the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Specifically, recall that the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is E(k) = ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 -k² sin²θ} dθ. But our integral is sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ. Let me see:

sqrt{1 + cos²φ} = sqrt{1 + (1 - sin²φ)} = sqrt{2 - sin²φ} = sqrt{2} sqrt{1 - (1/2) sin²φ}

So sqrt{1 + cos²φ} = sqrt{2} sqrt{1 - (1/2) sin²φ}

Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 + cos²φ} dφ = sqrt{2} ∫₀^{π/2} sqrt{1 - (1/2) sin²φ} dφ = sqrt{2} E(1/√2)

Where E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k. Therefore, the original integral becomes:

sqrt{2} * sqrt{2} E(1/√2) = 2 E(1/√2)

So the definite integral is 2 E(1/√2). Therefore, the exact answer is 2E(1/√2), where E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.

Now, the problem asks for the exact answer in LaTeX. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is usually denoted as E(k), so the exact answer is 2E\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) since 1/√2 is equal to √2/2. Alternatively, it can be written as 2E\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right). Both are equivalent.

For the numerical approximation, the value of E(√2/2) is known. The complete elliptic integral of the second kind E(k) can be computed numerically. Using known values, E(√2/2) ≈ 1.350643881. Therefore, multiplying by 2 gives approximately 2.701287762. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 2.7012877617.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2E\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.7012877617.
