Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (sin(log x) - log x) divided by (log x)^2 dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the integral. The integrand is [sin(log x) - log x] / [log x]^2. That looks a bit complicated, but maybe substitution can help here.

First, let me consider substitution to simplify the expression. The log x term is appearing multiple times, so maybe substituting t = log x would be useful. Let's try that. If t = log x, then dt/dx = 1/x, so dx = e^t dt. Wait, when x is from 0 to 1, log x goes from -infinity to 0. So the limits of t would be from -infty to 0. So the integral becomes the integral from t = -infty to t = 0 of [sin(t) - t]/t^2 * e^t dt. Hmm, that might be a better form to work with.

So the integral is ∫_{-infty}^0 [sin(t) - t]/t^2 * e^t dt. Let me write that as ∫_{-infty}^0 [sin(t) - t] e^t / t^2 dt. Maybe integrating by parts? Let's see. The denominator is t^2, so perhaps set u = [sin(t) - t] e^t and dv = dt/t^2. Wait, but integrating by parts usually requires u and dv such that v du is manageable. Alternatively, maybe split the integral into two parts: ∫ [sin(t) e^t / t^2] dt - ∫ [t e^t / t^2] dt = ∫ [sin(t) e^t / t^2] dt - ∫ [e^t / t] dt. Hmm, but integrating e^t / t is problematic because that's the exponential integral function, which isn't elementary. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution in the original integral. Maybe another substitution. Let me think. The integrand has sin(log x) and log x terms. Another approach could be to use substitution u = log x, which is similar to what I did before, but perhaps I can manipulate the integral into a more familiar form.

Wait, maybe differentiation under the integral sign? Let me consider introducing a parameter. Let's define F(a) = ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x] / (log x)^2 dx. Then, perhaps differentiate F(a) with respect to a to simplify the integral. Then set a=1 at the end. Let's try that.

So F(a) = ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x] / (log x)^2 dx. Let's compute dF/da. The derivative of sin(a log x) with respect to a is log x cos(a log x), and the derivative of -a log x is -log x. So dF/da = ∫_0^1 [log x cos(a log x) - log x] / (log x)^2 dx = ∫_0^1 [cos(a log x) - 1] / log x dx.

Hmm, that's a different integral. Let's see if this is easier. Let me substitute t = log x again here. Then x = e^t, dx = e^t dt, and when x=0, t=-infty; x=1, t=0. So dF/da becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a t) - 1]/t * e^t dt. Hmm, this integral. Maybe integrating this with respect to a?

Wait, perhaps integrating dF/da to get F(a). Since F(a) is the integral we need when a=1, and if we can find F(a) by integrating dF/da from a=0 to a=1, given that F(0) can be computed. Let's check F(0). When a=0, F(0) = ∫_0^1 [sin(0) - 0]/(log x)^2 dx = 0. So F(a) = ∫_{0}^a [dF/da'] da' + F(0) = ∫_{0}^a [∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a' t) - 1]/t * e^t dt] da'.

But this seems complicated. Maybe switch the order of integration. So F(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t [∫_{0}^a (cos(a' t) - 1)/t da'] dt. Let's compute the inner integral. The integral over a' from 0 to a of [cos(a' t) - 1]/t da'. Let's compute that:

∫_{0}^a [cos(a' t) - 1]/t da' = (1/t) [ ∫_{0}^a cos(a' t) da' - ∫_{0}^a 1 da' ] = (1/t)[ (sin(a t)/t - 0 ) - a ] = (sin(a t)/t^2 - a/t )

So F(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t [ sin(a t)/t^2 - a/t ] dt. Hmm, but this seems similar to the original integral. Wait, but the original integral when a=1 is F(1) = ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t [ sin(t)/t^2 - 1/t ] dt. Which is the same as the original substitution. So maybe this approach isn't helping. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's go back to the original substitution t = log x. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 [sin(t) - t]/t^2 * e^t dt. Let's split this into two integrals: ∫_{-infty}^0 sin(t) e^t / t^2 dt - ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t / t dt. The second integral is ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t / t dt, which is divergent? Wait, as t approaches 0 from the left, 1/t term goes to -infinity, but e^t is 1. So near t=0, the integral behaves like ∫_{-epsilon}^0 (1/t) dt, which is divergent. But the original integral from 0 to 1: when x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, so t approaches -infty. Wait, but in the substitution, the integral is from t=-infty to t=0. So the integrand is [sin(t) - t]/t^2 * e^t. Let's check the behavior at t approaching -infty and t approaching 0.

As t approaches -infty, e^t approaches 0, and sin(t) is bounded between -1 and 1. The numerator [sin(t) - t] ~ -t, so the integrand behaves like (-t)/t^2 * e^t = -e^t}/t. As t approaches -infty, e^t is e^{-|t|}, which decays exponentially, so the integrand behaves like -e^{-|t|}/t, which tends to 0. So the integral converges at the lower limit.

At t approaching 0, near t=0, let's expand sin(t) as t - t^3/6 + ... So sin(t) - t ~ -t^3/6. Then [sin(t) - t]/t^2 ~ -t/6. So the integrand becomes (-t/6) * e^t ~ -t/6 *1, so near t=0, the integrand behaves like -t/6, which is integrable. So the integral is convergent overall.

But the second integral ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t / t dt is problematic at t=0. Wait, in the original split, we have ∫ [sin(t) - t]/t^2 e^t dt = ∫ sin(t) e^t / t^2 dt - ∫ e^t / t dt. But the second integral ∫ e^t / t dt from -infty to 0 is the same as ∫_{-infty}^0 e^t / t dt, which is divergent. But the original integral is convergent, so perhaps the two divergent parts cancel each other? That can't be. Wait, maybe splitting the integral is not allowed here because both integrals individually diverge, but their difference converges. So we have to handle them together.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts to handle the 1/t^2 term. Let's consider integrating ∫ [sin(t) - t]/t^2 e^t dt. Let me set u = [sin(t) - t], dv = e^t / t^2 dt. Then du = [cos(t) - 1] dt, and v = ∫ e^t / t^2 dt. Hmm, but integrating e^t / t^2 is not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe set u = e^t, dv = [sin(t) - t]/t^2 dt. Let's see. Then du = e^t dt, and dv = [sin(t) - t]/t^2 dt. Then v would be the integral of [sin(t) - t]/t^2 dt. Let's compute v.

Compute v = ∫ [sin(t) - t]/t^2 dt = ∫ sin(t)/t^2 dt - ∫ 1/t dt. The second integral is -∫1/t dt = -ln|t| + C. The first integral, ∫ sin(t)/t^2 dt. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = sin(t), dv = 1/t^2 dt. Then du = cos(t) dt, v = -1/t. So ∫ sin(t)/t^2 dt = -sin(t)/t + ∫ cos(t)/t dt. So putting it all together, v = [ -sin(t)/t + ∫ cos(t)/t dt ] - ln|t| + C. But ∫ cos(t)/t dt is the cosine integral, Ci(t), which is a special function. So this approach might not lead us to an elementary function solution. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps another substitution. Let me consider t = -u, so when t goes from -infty to 0, u goes from +infty to 0. Then the integral becomes ∫_{u=infty}^0 [sin(-u) - (-u)] / (-u)^2 * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_{0}^infty [ -sin(u) + u ] / u^2 * e^{-u} du. Which simplifies to ∫_{0}^infty [u - sin(u)] e^{-u} / u^2 du. Let's write that as ∫_{0}^\infty [u - sin(u)] e^{-u} / u^2 du. Maybe this is easier to handle. Let's split this into two integrals: ∫_{0}^\infty [u e^{-u} / u^2] du - ∫_{0}^\infty [sin(u) e^{-u} / u^2] du = ∫_{0}^\infty e^{-u} / u du - ∫_{0}^\infty sin(u) e^{-u} / u^2 du. Wait, the first integral here is ∫_{0}^\infty e^{-u}/u du, which diverges as u approaches 0. But again, the original integral is convergent, so the divergences must cancel. Hmm, this seems similar to the previous problem. So perhaps integrating by parts again.

Alternatively, let's consider the integral ∫_{0}^\infty [u - sin(u)] e^{-u} / u^2 du. Let's combine the numerator: [u - sin(u)] = u - sin(u). Let's write this as 1/u^2 * (u - sin(u)) e^{-u}. Maybe expand sin(u) as a Taylor series. Since sin(u) = u - u^3/6 + u^5/120 - ..., so u - sin(u) = u^3/6 - u^5/120 + ... So [u - sin(u)]/u^2 = u/6 - u^3/120 + ... Then multiplying by e^{-u}, the integrand becomes (u/6 - u^3/120 + ...) e^{-u}. Then integrating term by term from 0 to infinity. But integrating term by term might be possible. Let's try that.

So [u - sin(u)]/u^2 = sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} u^{2n-1}/( (2n+1)! ) ). Wait, let's check:

sin(u) = sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k u^{2k+1}/( (2k+1)! )

So u - sin(u) = u - [u - u^3/6 + u^5/120 - ...] = u^3/6 - u^5/120 + u^7/5040 - ... = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} u^{2k+1}/( (2k+1)! )

Then [u - sin(u)]/u^2 = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} u^{2k-1}/( (2k+1)! )

So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} u^{2k-1}/( (2k+1)! ) e^{-u} du. If we can interchange the sum and the integral, then we can compute each term.

Assuming uniform convergence, we can interchange:

sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k+1)! ) ] ∫_{0}^\infty u^{2k-1} e^{-u} du.

The integral ∫_{0}^\infty u^{2k-1} e^{-u} du is the Gamma function Γ(2k) = (2k -1)!.

So each term becomes [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k+1)! ) ] * (2k -1)! ) = [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k(2k+1)) ) ]

Therefore, the integral is sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k(2k+1)) ) ]

Let's write this sum:

Sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k(2k+1)) ) ].

Let me compute this sum. Let's denote S = sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k+1} / (2k(2k+1)) ) ]

We can split the fraction using partial fractions:

1/(2k(2k+1)) = 1/(2k) - 1/(2k+1)

So S = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} [1/(2k) - 1/(2k+1)].

So S = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k) - sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1)

Let's compute each sum separately.

First sum: S1 = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k) = (1/2) sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/k = (1/2) ln(2), since sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/k = ln(2).

Second sum: S2 = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1). Let's compute this. Let's note that sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4 (the Leibniz formula for π/4). So sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1) = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1) = sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1) + (-1)^{0+1}/(2*0+1) = -sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) + (-1)/1 = -π/4 -1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let's check:

Wait, the original sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) = π/4. So sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1) = sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1}/(2k+1) = - sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1). Let's write that as - [ sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k/(2k+1) - (-1)^0/(2*0+1) ] = - [ π/4 - 1 ] = -π/4 +1. So S2 = 1 - π/4.

Therefore, S = S1 - S2 = (1/2) ln(2) - (1 - π/4) = (1/2) ln(2) -1 + π/4.

So the integral is equal to S = (π/4) -1 + (1/2) ln(2).

Wait, let me check the signs again. S = S1 - S2. S1 is (1/2) ln(2). S2 is 1 - π/4. So S = (1/2) ln(2) - (1 - π/4) = (1/2) ln(2) -1 + π/4. So the integral is π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln(2).

Therefore, the original integral from 0 to1 is equal to π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln(2). Let me verify this result.

Alternatively, let's check with approximate numerical integration. Let's compute the integral numerically. The exact answer is π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln(2). Let's compute this:

π ≈ 3.1415926536, so π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634.

ln(2) ≈ 0.6931471806, so (1/2) ln(2) ≈ 0.3465735903.

So π/4 -1 + 0.3465735903 ≈ 0.7853981634 -1 +0.3465735903 ≈ (0.7853981634 +0.3465735903) -1 ≈ 1.131971754 -1 ≈ 0.131971754.

So the numerical value is approximately 0.131971754. Let me check this with a numerical approximation of the original integral.

But since I can't compute it here, but let's see if the steps make sense. The substitution led to an integral that could be expressed as a series, which summed to π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln(2). That seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again. Let's go back to the original integral:

∫_0^1 [sin(log x) - log x]/(log x)^2 dx.

Let me make substitution t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x=0, t=infty; x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{infty}^0 [sin(-t) - (-t)]/(t^2) * (-e^{-t}) dt = ∫_0^infty [ -sin t + t ]/t^2 * e^{-t} dt = ∫_0^infty [ t - sin t ] e^{-t}/t^2 dt.

Which is the same as before. Then, integrating by parts. Let's consider integrating [ t - sin t ] e^{-t}/t^2. Let me set u = t - sin t, dv = e^{-t}/t^2 dt. Then du = (1 - cos t) dt, and v = ∫ e^{-t}/t^2 dt. But integrating e^{-t}/t^2 is not straightforward. Alternatively, integrate by parts with u = e^{-t}, dv = (t - sin t)/t^2 dt. Then du = -e^{-t} dt, and dv = (1/t - sin t / t^2) dt. Then v = ln t + ∫ sin t / t^2 dt. But again, this leads to the same problem as before.

Alternatively, let's consider integrating [ t - sin t ] e^{-t}/t^2 = e^{-t} (1/t - sin t / t^2 ). Let's write this as e^{-t}/t - e^{-t} sin t / t^2. Then integrate term by term. The first term is e^{-t}/t, which integrates to the exponential integral function Ei(-t), but over 0 to infinity, which might not converge. The second term is e^{-t} sin t / t^2. Hmm, but this approach is not helpful.

Wait, but earlier we expanded [ t - sin t ]/t^2 as a series and integrated term by term, leading to the sum which gave π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln 2. Let's check if that's correct.

Alternatively, let's use differentiation under the integral sign. Let me define F(a) = ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x]/(log x)^2 dx. Then, as before, F(1) is our desired integral. Then, differentiating F(a) with respect to a:

F'(a) = ∫_0^1 [ log x cos(a log x) - log x ] / (log x)^2 ) dx = ∫_0^1 [ cos(a log x) -1 ] / log x dx.

Again, substitution t = log x, so x = e^t, dx = e^t dt, limits from t=-infty to 0:

F'(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 [ cos(a t) -1 ] / t * e^t dt = ∫_0^infty [ cos(-a t) -1 ] / (-t) * e^{-t} (-dt) [substituting t -> -t]

= ∫_0^infty [ cos(a t) -1 ] / t * e^{-t} dt.

This integral is known. Let's recall that ∫_0^infty (cos(bt) -1)/t e^{-ct} dt = (1/2) ln( (c^2 + b^2)/c^2 ) ) for c >0. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

The integral ∫_0^infty (cos(bt) -1)/t e^{-ct} dt. Let's consider differentiating with respect to b:

Let’s(b) = ∫_0^∞ (cos(bt) -1)/t e^{-ct} dt.

Then dFs/db = -∫_0^∞ sin(bt) e^{-ct} dt = - ∫_0^∞ sin(bt) e^{-ct} dt.

The integral of sin(bt) e^{-ct} dt from 0 to ∞ is b/(b^2 + c^2). So dFs/db = -b/(b^2 + c^2). Integrating this with respect to b:

Fs(b) = - (1/2) ln(b^2 + c^2) + C. When b=0, Fs(0) = 0, so C = (1/2) ln(c^2). Therefore, Fs(b) = (1/2) ln(c^2) - (1/2) ln(b^2 + c^2) = (1/2) ln( c^2 / (b^2 + c^2) ) = (1/2) ln( c^2 / (b^2 + c^2) ).

But in our case, c=1, so Fs(b) = (1/2) ln(1 / (1 + b^2)) = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2).

But wait, Fs(b) = ∫_0^infty (cos(bt) -1)/t e^{-t} dt = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2).

Therefore, F'(a) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2).

Therefore, F(a) = - (1/2) ∫ ln(1 + a^2) da + C. To find C, note that when a=0, F(0) = ∫_0^1 [0 -0]/(log x)^2 dx =0. So F(0)=0. Therefore,

F(a) = - (1/2) ∫_0^a ln(1 + a'^2) da' + C. But C=0.

So compute the integral ∫ ln(1 + a^2) da. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = ln(1 + a^2), dv = da. Then du = (2a)/(1 + a^2) da, v = a. So ∫ ln(1 + a^2) da = a ln(1 + a^2) - ∫ (2a^2)/(1 + a^2) da.

The remaining integral: ∫ (2a^2)/(1 + a^2) da = 2 ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + a^2)] da = 2(a - arctan a) + C.

Therefore, ∫ ln(1 + a^2) da = a ln(1 + a^2) - 2a + 2 arctan a + C.

Therefore, F(a) = - (1/2)[ a ln(1 + a^2) - 2a + 2 arctan a ] + C. But since F(0)=0, substituting a=0:

F(0) = - (1/2)[0 -0 +0 ] + C = C =0. So C=0.

Thus, F(a) = - (1/2) a ln(1 + a^2) + a - arctan a.

Therefore, the original integral is F(1) = - (1/2)(1) ln(2) +1 - arctan(1).

Since arctan(1) = π/4, this gives:

F(1) = - (1/2) ln 2 +1 - π/4.

Which is the same as 1 - π/4 - (1/2) ln 2. Wait, but earlier when we computed the series, we got π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln 2. There's a discrepancy in the sign. Wait, let's check the steps.

Wait, in the differentiation under the integral sign approach, we found F'(a) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Then integrating from 0 to 1:

F(1) = F(0) + ∫_0^1 F'(a) da = 0 - (1/2) ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da.

Then, integrating ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da = [ a ln(1 + a^2) - 2a + 2 arctan a ] from 0 to1.

At a=1: 1*ln2 -2*1 +2*(π/4) = ln2 -2 + π/2.

At a=0: 0 -0 +0=0.

So the integral is ln2 -2 + π/2.

Thus, F(1) = - (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2) = - (1/2) ln2 +1 - π/4.

So F(1) = 1 - π/4 - (1/2) ln2.

But earlier, when we did the series expansion, we got π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2. The signs are different. There must be a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let's check the substitution steps again. When we did the substitution t = -log x, the integral became ∫_0^infty [t - sin t] e^{-t}/t^2 dt. Then expanding [t - sin t]/t^2 as a series and integrating term by term gave us a sum which evaluated to π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2. But the differentiation under the integral sign approach gave us 1 - π/4 - (1/2) ln2. These two results have opposite signs. Which one is correct?

Let me check the numerical approximation. Let's compute both expressions:

First expression: π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2 ≈ 0.7853981634 -1 +0.3465735903 ≈ 0.1319717537.

Second expression: 1 - π/4 - (1/2) ln2 ≈ 1 -0.7853981634 -0.3465735903 ≈ 1 -1.131971754 ≈ -0.131971754.

But the original integral is ∫_0^1 [sin(log x) - log x]/(log x)^2 dx. Let's consider the integrand. When x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, so the integrand becomes [sin(-infty) - (-infty)] / ( (-infty)^2 ). But sin(-infty) oscillates between -1 and 1, so the numerator is roughly -infty, and the denominator is +infty^2, so the integrand approaches 0. Near x=1, log x approaches 0, so expand log x = t near 0. The integrand becomes [sin(t) - t]/t^2. Expand sin(t) = t - t^3/6 + t^5/120 - ..., so [sin(t) - t]/t^2 = (-t^3/6 + ...)/t^2 = -t/6 + ..., which approaches 0 as t approaches 0. So the integrand is well-behaved. The integral should be positive or negative?

Let's check the integrand for x between 0 and 1. Let's pick x=1/e, so log x = -1. Then the integrand is [sin(-1) - (-1)] / (-1)^2 = [ -sin(1) +1 ] /1 = 1 - sin(1) ≈ 1 -0.841470985 ≈0.158529015, which is positive. Another point, x=1/e^2, log x=-2. Integrand: [sin(-2) - (-2)] / (-2)^2 = [ -sin(2) +2 ] /4 ≈ [ -0.9092974268 +2 ] /4 ≈1.090702573 /4 ≈0.272675643, positive. So the integrand is positive in (0,1), so the integral should be positive. Therefore, the correct answer should be approximately 0.13197, which is positive. Therefore, the first result from the series expansion is correct, and the differentiation approach must have a sign error.

Wait, but in the differentiation approach, F(a) = ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x]/(log x)^2 dx. Then F'(a) = ∫_0^1 [ log x cos(a log x) - log x ] / (log x)^2 dx = ∫_0^1 [ cos(a log x) -1 ] / log x dx. Then substitution t = log x, x = e^t, dx = e^t dt, limits from t=-infty to 0. So F'(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 [ cos(a t) -1 ] / t * e^t dt. Then we did substitution t = -u, leading to ∫_0}^infty [ cos(-a u) -1 ] / (-u) * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_0}^infty [ cos(a u) -1 ] / u * e^{-u} du. Which is the same as ∫_0}^infty (cos(a u) -1)/u e^{-u} du. Then we used the formula for Fs(b) = ∫_0^infty (cos(bu) -1)/u e^{-u} du = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2). Therefore, F'(a) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Then integrating from 0 to1 gives F(1) = - (1/2) ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da. Which we computed as - (1/2)[ a ln(1 + a^2) - 2a + 2 arctan a ] from 0 to1. At a=1, this is - (1/2)[ ln2 -2 + 2*(π/4) ] = - (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2) = - (1/2) ln2 +1 - π/4. Which is approximately -0.34657 +1 -0.7854 ≈ -0.34657 +0.2146 ≈ -0.13197. But this contradicts the numerical expectation of a positive integral. So there must be a mistake in the differentiation approach.

Wait, let's check the substitution step again. When we did the substitution t = -log x, the integral became ∫_0^infty [t - sin t] e^{-t}/t^2 dt. But in the differentiation approach, we have F(a) = ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x]/(log x)^2 dx. When a=1, this is the original integral. But in the differentiation approach, we found F(1) = - (1/2) ln2 +1 - π/4 ≈ -0.13197, which is negative. But the integrand is positive, so the integral should be positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the differentiation approach.

Let me check the substitution in the differentiation approach. When we set t = log x, then x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. When x approaches 0, t approaches -infty. So F'(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a t) -1]/t * e^t dt. Then we substituted t = -u, so u = -t, then t = -infty corresponds to u=infty, and t=0 corresponds to u=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{infty}^0 [cos(-a u) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du. Which is correct. Then we used the formula for Fs(b) = ∫_0^infty (cos(bu) -1)/u e^{-u} du = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2). But wait, the formula I recalled earlier was for ∫_0^infty (cos(bu) -1)/u e^{-c u} du = (1/2) ln( c^2 / (b^2 + c^2) ). In our case, c=1, so it's (1/2) ln(1/(1 + b^2)) = - (1/2) ln(1 + b^2). So that's correct. Therefore, F'(a) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Then integrating from 0 to1 gives F(1) = - (1/2) ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da. But this gives a negative result, which is impossible since the integrand is positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign during substitution.

Wait, let's check the original substitution again. The original integral is ∫_0^1 [sin(log x) - log x]/(log x)^2 dx. When we substitute t = log x, x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. The limits from x=0 to x=1 become t=-infty to t=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 [sin(t) - t]/t^2 * e^t dt. Then, in the differentiation approach, F(a) is defined as ∫_0^1 [sin(a log x) - a log x]/(log x)^2 dx. So when a=1, it's the original integral. Then F'(a) = ∫_0^1 [log x cos(a log x) - log x]/(log x)^2 dx = ∫_0^1 [cos(a log x) -1]/log x dx. Then substitution t = log x gives ∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a t) -1]/t * e^t dt. Then changing variables to u = -t, we get ∫_0^infty [cos(-a u) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du. Which is correct. So F'(a) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Therefore, integrating F'(a) from 0 to1 gives F(1) = - (1/2) ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da. But this gives a negative result, which contradicts the positive integrand. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the substitution in the differentiation approach is incorrect. Let me check the integrand of F'(a). F'(a) = ∫_0^1 [cos(a log x) -1]/log x dx. When x is in (0,1), log x is negative. So [cos(a log x) -1]/log x. Let's take a=1, x=1/e, log x=-1. Then [cos(-1) -1]/(-1) = [cos(1) -1]/(-1) = (0.5403 -1)/(-1) = (-0.4597)/(-1) =0.4597, which is positive. So the integrand of F'(a) is positive for a=1. Therefore, F'(a) should be positive. But according to the formula, F'(a) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2), which is negative for all a>0. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the application of the formula.

Wait, the formula I used was for ∫_0^infty (cos(bu) -1)/u e^{-c u} du = (1/2) ln(c^2/(b^2 + c^2)). But in our case, the integral is ∫_0^infty (cos(a u) -1)/u e^{-u} du. So c=1, b=a. So the result should be (1/2) ln(1/(1 + a^2)) = - (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). But in our case, the integral is ∫_0^infty (cos(a u) -1)/u e^{-u} du. But the integrand (cos(a u) -1)/u is negative for all u>0, since cos(a u) <=1, so cos(a u) -1 <=0, and divided by u>0), so the integrand is negative. Therefore, the integral should be negative, which matches the formula. However, in our case, F'(a) is equal to this integral, which is negative. But when we computed F'(a) for a=1, the integrand was positive. This suggests that there's a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, no. When we did the substitution in F'(a), we had F'(a) = ∫_0^1 [cos(a log x) -1]/log x dx. Let's substitute t = log x, so x = e^t, dx = e^t dt, limits from t=-infty to0. So F'(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a t) -1]/t * e^t dt. Then changing variables to u = -t, we get ∫_{infty}^0 [cos(-a u) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du. But in this integral, the integrand [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} is negative, since [cos(a u) -1] <=0, and u>0, e^{-u} >0. So the integral is negative. But when we computed F'(a) by substituting a=1 and x=1/e, the integrand was positive. How is this possible?

Ah! Because in the original integral for F'(a), the integrand [cos(a log x) -1]/log x is positive. But log x is negative in (0,1), so [cos(a log x) -1] is negative (since cos(something) <=1, so [cos(...) -1] <=0. Then divided by log x, which is negative, gives a positive integrand. So F'(a) is positive. But according to the substitution, F'(a) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u e^{-u} du, which is negative. This is because the substitution introduced a sign. Wait, let's check:

Original F'(a) = ∫_{-infty}^0 [cos(a t) -1]/t * e^t dt. Let's split the integral into two parts: from -infty to -epsilon and from -epsilon to0. Let's take t negative. Let t = -u, u>0. Then t = -u, dt = -du. So F'(a) = ∫_{u=infty}^{u=0} [cos(-a u) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} (-du) = ∫_0^infty [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du. But [cos(a u) -1]/u is negative, since cos(a u) -1 <=0 and u>0. So the integral is negative. But in the original integral, F'(a) is positive. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, no. Let's compute [cos(a t) -1]/t * e^t when t is negative. Let t = -u, u>0. Then [cos(a (-u)) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} = [cos(a u) -1]/(-u) * e^{-u} = - [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u}. So the integral becomes ∫_0^infty - [cos(a u) -1]/u * e^{-u} du = ∫_0}^infty [1 - cos(a u)]/u * e^{-u} du. Which is positive, since [1 - cos(a u)]/u is positive for u>0. Therefore, F'(a) = ∫_0}^infty [1 - cos(a u)]/u * e^{-u} du. Which is positive. But according to the previous formula, this integral is equal to (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Wait, the formula I used earlier was ∫_0^infty (cos(bu) -1)/u e^{-cu} du = - (1/2) ln(1 + (b/c)^2). But if we have ∫_0^infty (1 - cos(bu))/u e^{-cu} du = (1/2) ln(1 + (b/c)^2). So in our case, F'(a) = ∫_0^infty (1 - cos(a u))/u e^{-u} du = (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Therefore, F'(a) = (1/2) ln(1 + a^2). Therefore, integrating from 0 to1 gives F(1) = (1/2) ∫_0^1 ln(1 + a^2) da + C. But F(0)=0, so C=0. Therefore, F(1) = (1/2)[ a ln(1 + a^2) - 2a + 2 arctan a ] from 0 to1. At a=1: (1/2)[ ln2 -2 + 2*(π/4) ] = (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2). At a=0: 0. So F(1) = (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2) ≈ (1/2)(0.6931 -2 +1.5708) ≈ (1/2)(0.2639) ≈0.13195, which matches the positive expectation. So the mistake was in the sign during the substitution step in the differentiation approach. The correct F'(a) is (1/2) ln(1 + a^2), leading to F(1) = (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2) ≈0.13195.

Therefore, the correct analytical result is (1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2). Let's simplify this:

(1/2)(ln2 -2 + π/2) = (1/2) ln2 -1 + π/4.

Which is the same as π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2, which matches the series expansion result. Therefore, the correct answer is π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2.

So the exact answer is π/4 -1 + (1/2) ln2. The numerical approximation is approximately 0.1319717537, which rounds to 0.1319717537.

So the final answer is:
