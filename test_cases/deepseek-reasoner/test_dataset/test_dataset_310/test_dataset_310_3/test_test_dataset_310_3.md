Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2.0 of ln[(2.0 + sqrt(2.0² - x²))/x] multiplied by D(0.5x) dx. First, I need to understand what D(0.5x) means here. In some contexts, D might denote the Dirac delta function, but that usually requires an argument that's a function of x. Alternatively, D could be a differential operator, but the notation is a bit unclear. Wait, the user mentioned it's a definite integral, and the notation D(0.5x) might be a typo or a specific notation they're using. Let me check the original problem again.

The integral is written as ∫₀² ln[(2 + √(4 - x²))/x] D(0.5x) dx. Hmm, maybe D here stands for the differential? Like d(0.5x), which would be 0.5 dx. That makes sense. So perhaps the integrand is ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] multiplied by the differential d(0.5x), which is 0.5 dx. So the integral becomes 0.5 ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] dx. That seems plausible. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, let's rewrite the integral as (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] dx. Now, the integrand is ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x]. Let's simplify the argument of the logarithm. The expression inside the log can be written as (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x. Let me see if there's a substitution that can simplify this.

Let’s consider a trigonometric substitution. Since we have sqrt(4 - x²), let’s set x = 2 sinθ. Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0; when x=2, θ=π/2. Let's substitute:

sqrt(4 - x²) = sqrt(4 - 4 sin²θ) = 2 cosθ. So the argument of the log becomes (2 + 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ. There's a trigonometric identity that (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2). Let me verify that:

Using the double-angle formulas: 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So (1 + cosθ)/sinθ = (2 cos²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2). Yes, that's correct. So the logarithm becomes ln(cot(θ/2)).

Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) * 2 cosθ dθ. The 2 from dx cancels with the 1/2, so we have ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Now, let's make a substitution for θ. Let’s set t = θ/2, so θ = 2t, dθ = 2 dt. When θ=0, t=0; θ=π/2, t=π/4. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) * cos(2t) * 2 dt. Wait, no: substituting θ = 2t, then cosθ = cos(2t), and dθ = 2 dt. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) * cos(2t) * 2 dt. Wait, original integral after substitution:

Original integral after substitution: ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Let θ = 2t, so θ/2 = t, dθ = 2 dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) * cos(2t) * 2 dt. So yes, 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts. Let me consider integrating by parts. Let’s set u = ln(cot t) and dv = cos(2t) dt. Then du = derivative of ln(cot t) dt. Let's compute du:

cot t = cos t / sin t, so ln(cot t) = ln(cos t) - ln(sin t). Therefore, derivative is (-sin t / cos t) - (cos t / sin t) = -tan t - cot t. Wait, that's derivative of ln(cot t) is (d/dt)(ln(cot t)) = (1/cot t)(-csc² t) = tan t * (-csc² t) = -csc² t * tan t = - (1/sin² t) * (sin t / cos t) ) = -1/(sin t cos t). Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me compute it again:

d/dt [ln(cot t)] = d/dt [ln(cos t) - ln(sin t)] = (-sin t / cos t) - (cos t / sin t) = -tan t - cot t. Wait, that's correct. So du/dt = -tan t - cot t. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, note that ln(cot t) = ln(1/tan t) = -ln(tan t). So the integral becomes -2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(tan t) cos(2t) dt. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let's proceed with integration by parts. Let u = ln(cot t) = -ln(tan t), dv = cos(2t) dt. Then du = - (sec² t / tan t) dt = - (1/(sin t cos t)) dt. And v = (1/2) sin(2t). So integration by parts gives uv|₀^{π/4} - ∫₀^{π/4} v du.

Compute uv at π/4: u = -ln(tan(π/4)) = -ln(1) = 0. At 0, tan t approaches 0, so ln(tan t) approaches -infty, but multiplied by v which is (1/2) sin(2t) which is 0. So maybe the boundary terms are zero? Let's check:

At upper limit t=π/4: u = 0, v = (1/2) sin(π/2) = 1/2. So 0 * 1/2 = 0.

At lower limit t=0: u approaches -ln(0) which is +infty, but v approaches (1/2) sin(0) = 0. So the product is 0*infty, which is an indeterminate form. Hmm, need to check the limit as t approaches 0 from the right. Let’s compute lim_{t→0+} u*v = lim_{t→0+} (-ln(tan t)) * (1/2 sin 2t). Note that sin 2t ≈ 2t, and tan t ≈ t, so ln(tan t) ≈ ln t. So the expression becomes -ln t * (1/2)(2t) = -t ln t. As t→0+, t ln t approaches 0 (since t approaches 0 faster than ln t approaches -infty). Therefore, the boundary terms are 0.

So the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/4} v du = - ∫₀^{π/4} (1/2 sin 2t) * (-1/(sin t cos t)) dt. Simplify the integrand:

- ∫ (1/2 sin 2t) * (-1/(sin t cos t)) dt = ∫ (1/2 sin 2t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) dt.

Note that sin 2t = 2 sin t cos t, so substituting:

∫ (1/2 * 2 sin t cos t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) dt = ∫ (sin t cos t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) dt = ∫ 1 dt from 0 to π/4. So the integral becomes [t] from 0 to π/4 = π/4 - 0 = π/4.

Therefore, the original integral after integration by parts is π/4. Wait, but let's recap:

The integral after substitution was 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then we did integration by parts and found that it equals π/4. Wait, but the steps led to the integral being equal to π/4. Therefore, the original integral (after considering the substitution and the 1/2 factor) would be:

Wait, let's retrace:

Original integral: (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] dx.

We did substitution x = 2 sinθ, leading to integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Then substitution θ = 2t, leading to 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Then integration by parts gave us π/4. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) * (π/4) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the original integral after substitution became ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Then after substitution θ = 2t, it became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then after integration by parts, that integral equals π/4. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) * [result after substitution]?

Wait, no. Wait, the original integral was (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx. Then after substitution x=2 sinθ, dx=2 cosθ dθ, so the integral becomes (1/2) * ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) * 2 cosθ dθ. The 1/2 and 2 cancel, so it's ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Then substitution θ=2t gives ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) * cos(2t) * 2 dt. Then after integration by parts, that integral equals π/4. Therefore, the original integral is π/4.

Wait, but the integration by parts result was that 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt = π/4. Therefore, the integral ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt = π/8. Wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, when we did the substitution θ = 2t, the integral became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then after integration by parts, we found that this integral equals π/4. Therefore, the original integral (after substitution) is π/4, which was the result of the substitution. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) * [integral after substitution]? Wait, no. Wait, the original integral was (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx, which after substitution became ∫₀^{π/2} ... dθ, which then became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt, which evaluated to π/4. Therefore, the original integral is π/4.

Wait, no. Let me retrace all steps:

Original integral: (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] dx.

Substitute x = 2 sinθ, dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Limits from θ=0 to θ=π/2.

Integral becomes (1/2) * ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(2 + 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ dθ.

Simplify the log term: ln[(2(1 + cosθ))/(2 sinθ)] = ln[(1 + cosθ)/sinθ] = ln(cot(θ/2)) as before.

So the integral becomes (1/2)*2 ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Then substitute θ = 2t, so θ/2 = t, dθ = 2 dt, limits from t=0 to t=π/4.

Integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) * cos(2t) * 2 dt.

Then we have 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Then we did integration by parts and found that this integral equals π/4.

Therefore, the original integral (1/2) * [result after substitution]? Wait, no. The original integral after substitution was ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ, which became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt, which evaluated to π/4. Therefore, the original integral is π/4.

Wait, but the original integral was (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx, which after substitution became ∫₀^{π/2} ... dθ, which then became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt, which evaluated to π/4. Therefore, the original integral is π/4. So the answer is π/4.

But let me verify this with a numerical check. Let's compute the integral numerically to see if it's approximately π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634.

Alternatively, let's compute the integral numerically. Let's take x from 0 to 2, and compute the function ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] * 0.5 dx. Wait, but the integral is (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] dx. Let's approximate this numerically.

But if the analytical result is π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634, then the numerical approximation should be around 0.7853981634. Let me check with a simple approximation. For example, at x=1, the integrand is ln[(2 + sqrt(3))/1] * 0.5 ≈ ln(2 + 1.73205) * 0.5 ≈ ln(3.73205) * 1.31696 * 0.5 ≈ 1.31696 * 0.5 ≈ 0.65848. But integrating from 0 to 2, the function might have some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the analytical result is correct.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach. Let's note that the integrand ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] can be rewritten. Let me see:

Let’s set y = x/2, so x = 2y, dx = 2 dy. Then the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀¹ ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - 4y²))/(2y)] * 2 dy = ∫₀¹ ln[(2 + 2 sqrt(1 - y²))/(2y)] dy = ∫₀¹ ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - y²))/y] dy.

Simplify the argument: (1 + sqrt(1 - y²))/y. Let’s consider substituting y = sinφ, where φ from 0 to π/2. Then sqrt(1 - y²) = cosφ, and dy = cosφ dφ. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(1 + cosφ)/sinφ] cosφ dφ. Wait, this looks similar to the previous substitution. Indeed, this is the same integral as before. So this substitution leads us back to the same integral, which we’re evaluating to π/4. So this confirms the result.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known integral formula. The integral ∫ ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. But we already evaluated it via integration by parts and found the result. So the conclusion is that the integral equals π/4.

Therefore, the exact answer is π/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7853981634. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7853981634.

But let me check with a numerical integration method. Let's approximate the integral ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x] * 0.5 dx numerically. Let's use Simpson's rule with a few intervals for estimation.

Divide the interval [0, 2] into n=4 subintervals, each of width h=0.5. The points are x=0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0. Compute the integrand at these points:

At x=0: The integrand is ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - 0))/0] * 0.5. But as x approaches 0, the argument of the log becomes (2 + 2)/x = 4/x, so ln(4/x) * 0.5. As x→0, ln(4/x) tends to infinity, but multiplied by x approaching 0. The limit as x→0 of x ln(4/x) is 0, so the integrand at x=0 is 0.5 * 0 = 0.

At x=0.5: ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - 0.25))/0.5] * 0.5 = ln[(2 + sqrt(3.75))/0.5] * 0.5. sqrt(3.75) ≈ 1.936491673, so 2 + 1.936491673 ≈ 3.936491673. Divide by 0.5: 7.872983346. ln(7.872983346) ≈ 2.063592. Multiply by 0.5: ≈1.031796.

At x=1.0: ln[(2 + sqrt(3))/1] *0.5 = ln(2 + 1.73205) *0.5 ≈ ln(3.73205) ≈1.31715 *0.5 ≈0.658575.

At x=1.5: ln[(2 + sqrt(4 - 2.25))/1.5] *0.5 = ln[(2 + sqrt(1.75))/1.5]. sqrt(1.75)≈1.322876. 2 +1.322876≈3.322876. Divide by 1.5≈2.21525. ln(2.21525)≈0.7956. Multiply by 0.5≈0.3978.

At x=2.0: ln[(2 + sqrt(0))/2] *0.5 = ln(2/2)*0.5 = ln(1)*0.5=0.

Now, Simpson's rule for n=4 (even number of intervals, but Simpson's requires even number of intervals for n even). Wait, Simpson's rule for n=4 (which is even) is applicable. The formula is (h/3)[f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) +4f(x3) +f(x4)].

So applying:

h=0.5, f0=0, f1=1.031796, f2=0.658575, f3=0.3978, f4=0.

Sum = 0 + 4*1.031796 + 2*0.658575 +4*0.3978 +0 = 4*1.031796=4.127184, 2*0.658575=1.31715, 4*0.3978=1.5912. Total sum: 4.127184 +1.31715 +1.5912 ≈7.035534. Multiply by h/3=0.5/3≈0.1666667. 7.035534 *0.1666667≈1.172589. But this is for the integral without the 0.5 factor. Wait, no: the integrand already includes the 0.5 factor. Wait, no: the original integral is (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx. So the integrand is 0.5 * ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x]. So when we computed the values at x=0.5, 1.0, etc., we already multiplied by 0.5. Therefore, the Simpson's rule sum as computed is the approximation of the original integral. But according to Simpson's rule with n=4, the approximation is approximately 1.172589, which is not close to π/4≈0.7854. This suggests that either the analytical result is wrong or the numerical approximation is inaccurate due to using only 4 intervals.

But this discrepancy is concerning. Let's check with a better numerical method. Let's use more intervals. Alternatively, perhaps the analytical result is incorrect. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, when we did the substitution x=2 sinθ, the integral became ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Then substitution θ=2t gives 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then integration by parts led to π/4. But perhaps there was a mistake in the integration by parts.

Let me redo the integration by parts step carefully.

Let’s consider the integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Let u = ln(cot t) = -ln(tan t). Then du/dt = - (sec² t / tan t) = - (1/(sin t cos t)).

dv = cos(2t) dt. Then v = (1/2) sin(2t).

Integration by parts: uv|₀^{π/4} - ∫₀^{π/4} v du.

Compute uv at π/4: u = -ln(tan(π/4)) = -ln(1) = 0. v = (1/2) sin(π/2) = 1/2. So 0 * 1/2 = 0.

At t=0: u approaches -ln(0) = +infty, but v approaches 0. The product is 0*infty, which we need to evaluate the limit as t→0+.

As t→0+, tan t ≈ t, so ln(tan t) ≈ ln t. v = (1/2) sin(2t) ≈ t. So uv ≈ -t ln t, which approaches 0 as t→0+.

Therefore, the boundary terms are 0.

Now, the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/4} v du = - ∫₀^{π/4} (1/2 sin 2t) * (-1/(sin t cos t)) dt.

Simplify the integrand:

(1/2 sin 2t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) = (1/2 * 2 sin t cos t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) = (sin t cos t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) = 1.

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} 1 dt = π/4.

Therefore, I = 2 * (π/4) = π/2. Wait, wait! Wait, the integral I was 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt, and after integration by parts, the integral became π/4. Therefore, I = 2*(π/4) = π/2. But this contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, no:

Wait, the integral I is 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. After integration by parts, this integral equals 2*(π/4) = π/2. Therefore, the original integral after substitution was I = π/2. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx equals π/2. Wait, this is different from before. So where was the mistake?

Let me retrace:

Original integral: (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] dx.

Substitution x=2 sinθ, dx=2 cosθ dθ. Then integral becomes (1/2)*2 ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Substitute θ=2t, so θ/2 = t, dθ=2 dt. Limits from t=0 to t=π/4.

Integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) * 2 dt = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Then, after integration by parts, this integral equals π/4. Therefore, the original integral is 2*(π/4) = π/2. Wait, no. Wait, the integration by parts gave us that the integral ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt equals π/4. Therefore, multiplying by 2 gives π/2. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx equals π/2. But this contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, no. Wait, the original integral after substitution became ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ, which after substitution became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then after integration by parts, this integral equals π/4. Therefore, the original integral is π/4. But this contradicts the latest calculation where the integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt = π/2. Wait, no, the integration by parts result was that the integral ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt equals π/4. Therefore, multiplying by 2 gives 2*(π/4) = π/2. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx equals π/2. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:

Original integral: (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx.

After substitution x=2 sinθ, integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Then substitute θ=2t, integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Then, after integration by parts, this integral (2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt) equals π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2. But wait, the integration by parts steps led to the integral ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt = π/4, so multiplying by 2 gives π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2. But this contradicts the previous conclusion. So where is the mistake?

Wait, the integration by parts was applied to the integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Let me re-express this:

Let I = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

After integration by parts, we found that this integral I equals 2*(π/4) = π/2. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx equals π/2. But this contradicts the earlier numerical approximation using Simpson's rule with n=4, which gave approximately 1.172589, which is larger than π/2≈1.5708. But 1.172589 is less than π/2. Wait, π/2 is approximately 1.5708. But the Simpson's approximation with n=4 gave 1.172589, which is less than π/2. This suggests that the analytical result might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me recheck:

After substitution, I = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt.

Integration by parts: u = ln(cot t), dv = cos(2t) dt.

Then du = - (1/(sin t cos t)) dt, v = (1/2) sin(2t).

Then uv|₀^{π/4} = 0 - 0 = 0.

Then - ∫ v du = - ∫ (1/2 sin 2t) * (-1/(sin t cos t)) dt = ∫ (1/2 sin 2t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) dt.

But sin 2t = 2 sin t cos t, so:

∫ (1/2 * 2 sin t cos t) * (1/(sin t cos t)) dt = ∫ 1 dt from 0 to π/4. So this integral is [t]₀^{π/4} = π/4.

Therefore, the integral I = 2*(π/4) = π/2. Therefore, the original integral (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx equals π/2. But this contradicts the earlier analytical step where we thought it was π/4. So where is the mistake?

Wait, no. The original integral after substitution was ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Then substitution θ=2t gives 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt. Then this integral I = 2/4 = π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2. But the original integral was (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx. Wait, no! Wait, the original integral after substitution was (1/2) ∫₀² ... dx became ∫₀^{π/2} ... dθ. So the original integral is equal to ∫₀^{π/2} ... dθ, which after substitution became 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dt, which evaluated to π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2. Therefore, the answer is π/2 ≈1.5707963268.

But this contradicts the earlier numerical approximation with n=4 which gave 1.172589. But perhaps the numerical approximation with n=4 is too crude. Let's try with more intervals.

Alternatively, let's use a better numerical method. Let's compute the integral numerically using substitution. Let's use x from 0 to 2, and compute the integrand (1/2) * ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x]. Let's note that at x=0, the integrand approaches 0.5 * ln(4/x) as x→0. The integral from 0 to 2 of 0.5 ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] dx.

Let's use numerical integration with higher precision. For example, using substitution x = 2 sinθ, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ. Let's compute this integral numerically.

Let’s sample θ at several points and apply Simpson's rule. Let's take n=10 intervals for better accuracy.

θ from 0 to π/2, divided into 10 intervals. h = (π/2)/10 ≈0.1570796327.

Compute the integrand f(θ) = ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ.

At θ=0: cot(0/2) is cot(0) which is infinity, so ln(inf) is infinity, but multiplied by cos(0)=1. However, the limit as θ→0+ of ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ. Let’s approximate near θ=0:

cot(θ/2) ≈ 2/(θ), so ln(cot(θ/2)) ≈ ln(2/θ). Then f(θ) ≈ ln(2/θ) * 1. The integral near 0 is ∫ ln(2/θ) dθ. Let’s make substitution t=θ, integral becomes ∫ ln(2/t) dt from t=0 to t=small. The integral of ln(2/t) dt is t ln(2/t) + t. As t→0, this approaches 0. Therefore, the contribution near θ=0 is negligible. Similarly, at θ=π/2, cot(π/4)=1, so ln(1)=0, and cos(π/2)=0, so the integrand is 0.

But to compute numerically, let's avoid θ=0 and θ=π/2 by starting from a small ε to π/2 - ε. Let's take ε=0.0001.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, use a calculator or software. But since I'm supposed to do this manually, let's try with n=10 intervals.

θ values: 0, h, 2h, ..., 10h=π/2.

But at θ=0, the integrand is problematic. Let's start from θ=h to θ=10h -h, and approximate the integral.

Alternatively, use the substitution t=θ/2, which we have already done. But perhaps it's better to accept that the analytical result is π/2 and the earlier numerical approximation with n=4 was too crude.

Alternatively, let's compute the integral using another substitution. Let’s consider the original integral:

I = (1/2) ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] dx.

Let’s make substitution x = 2 sinθ, dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Then:

I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(2 + 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(1 + cosθ)/sinθ] cosθ dθ.

As before, this simplifies to ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Let’s make substitution φ = θ/2, so θ = 2φ, dθ = 2 dφ. Limits from φ=0 to φ=π/4.

Integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cotφ) cos(2φ) * 2 dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cotφ) cos(2φ) dφ.

This is the same integral as before, which after integration by parts equals π/2. Therefore, the original integral I = π/2.

But wait, earlier integration by parts led to the integral being π/4, but that was when we had 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dφ. Wait, no. Let me recheck:

After substitution, the integral is 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cotφ) cos(2φ) dφ.

Integration by parts:

u = ln(cotφ) = -ln(tanφ)

dv = cos(2φ) dφ => v = (1/2) sin(2φ)

du = - (sec²φ / tanφ) dφ = - (1/(sinφ cosφ)) dφ

Then, evaluated from 0 to π/4:

uv|₀^{π/4} = [ -ln(tanφ) * (1/2) sin(2φ) ] from 0 to π/4.

At φ=π/4: tan(π/4)=1, so ln(1)=0, and sin(π/2)=1. So term is 0.

At φ=0: tanφ approaches 0, so ln(tanφ) approaches -infty, but sin(2φ) approaches 0. The product is 0 * infty, which we evaluated earlier to be 0.

Then the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/4} v du = - ∫₀^{π/4} (1/2 sin2φ) * (-1/(sinφ cosφ)) dφ = ∫₀^{π/4} (1/2 sin2φ) * (1/(sinφ cosφ)) dφ.

Simplify sin2φ = 2 sinφ cosφ, so:

∫₀^{π/4} (1/2 * 2 sinφ cosφ) * (1/(sinφ cosφ)) dφ = ∫₀^{π/4} 1 dφ = π/4.

Therefore, the integral 2 ∫₀^{π/4} ... dφ = 2*(π/4) = π/2.

Therefore, the original integral I = π/2 ≈1.5707963268.

But this contradicts the earlier Simpson's rule approximation with n=4 which gave approximately 1.172589. However, using a larger n would give a better approximation. Let's try with n=10.

But since this is time-consuming, let's accept that the analytical result is π/2. Therefore, the exact answer is π/2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.5707963268, which rounds to 1.5707963268.

But wait, the original problem statement says to compute the definite integral ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] D(0.5x) dx. If D(0.5x) is indeed the differential d(0.5x) = 0.5 dx, then the integral is 0.5 ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] dx, which we found to be π/2. But wait, no: the original integral is ∫₀² ... D(0.5x) dx. If D(0.5x) is d(0.5x) = 0.5 dx, then the integral is 0.5 ∫₀² ... dx. But according to our analysis, this integral equals π/2, so the original integral would be π/2. But wait, no: the integral after substitution became ∫₀^{π/2} ... dθ, which evaluated to π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2. Therefore, the answer is π/2.

But let's confirm with another approach. Let's consider the integral I = ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] * 0.5 dx.

Let’s make substitution x = 2 sinθ, as before. Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ. The integral becomes 0.5 ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(2 + 2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln[(1 + cosθ)/sinθ] cosθ dθ.

As before, this is ∫₀^{π/2} ln(cot(θ/2)) cosθ dθ.

Let’s make substitution t = θ/2, so θ = 2t, dθ = 2 dt. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) * 2 dt.

Integration by parts as before, leading to π/2. Therefore, the integral is π/2.

Therefore, the exact answer is π/2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.5707963268.

But wait, the user's problem statement says to compute the definite integral ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] D(0.5x) dx. If D(0.5x) is indeed the differential d(0.5x) = 0.5 dx, then the integral is 0.5 ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] dx, which we found to be π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2.

But earlier, when we did the integration by parts, we found that the integral ∫₀^{π/4} ln(cot t) cos(2t) dt = π/4, and multiplying by 2 gives π/2. Therefore, the original integral is π/2.

But this contradicts the initial assumption that the answer was π/4. Therefore, the correct exact answer is π/2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.5707963268.

But let's check with another approach. Let's consider differentiating under the integral sign or using series expansion.

Alternatively, consider that the integral I = ∫₀² ln[(2 + sqrt(4 -x²))/x] * 0.5 dx.

Let’s write the integrand as 0.5 [ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) - ln x].

Split the integral into two parts: 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx - 0.5 ∫₀² ln x dx.

Compute each part separately.

First integral: 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx.

Second integral: -0.5 ∫₀² ln x dx.

The second integral is straightforward: ∫ ln x dx = x ln x - x. Evaluated from 0 to 2. At x=2: 2 ln 2 - 2. At x=0: the limit as x→0+ of x ln x -x is 0 -0 =0. Therefore, the second integral is -0.5 [ (2 ln 2 - 2) - 0 ] = -0.5 (2 ln 2 - 2) = -ln 2 +1.

Now, the first integral: 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx. Let's make substitution x=2 sinθ, dx=2 cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes 0.5 ∫₀^{π/2} ln(2 + 2 cosθ) * 2 cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(2(1 + cosθ)) cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} [ln 2 + ln(1 + cosθ)] cosθ dθ.

Split into two integrals: ln 2 ∫₀^{π/2} cosθ dθ + ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + cosθ) cosθ dθ.

First integral: ln 2 [sinθ ]₀^{π/2} = ln 2 (1 -0) = ln 2.

Second integral: ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + cosθ) cosθ dθ. Let's compute this integral.

Let’s use integration by parts. Let u = ln(1 + cosθ), dv = cosθ dθ.

Then du = (-sinθ)/(1 + cosθ) dθ, v = sinθ.

Integration by parts: uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v du.

At θ=π/2: u = ln(1 + 0) = 0, v=1. So 0*1=0.

At θ=0: u = ln(2), v=0. So 0*ln(2)=0.

Therefore, the integral becomes - ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ * (-sinθ)/(1 + cosθ) dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (sin²θ)/(1 + cosθ) dθ.

Simplify the integrand: (sin²θ)/(1 + cosθ) = (1 - cos²θ)/(1 + cosθ) = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ)/(1 + cosθ) )= 1 - cosθ.

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (1 - cosθ) dθ = [θ - sinθ]₀^{π/2} = (π/2 -1) - (0 -0) = π/2 -1.

Therefore, the second integral is π/2 -1.

Therefore, the first integral (0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx) equals ln 2 + (π/2 -1).

Therefore, the original integral I = (ln 2 + π/2 -1) - ln 2 +1 = π/2.

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

Original integral I = 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx -0.5 ∫₀² ln x dx.

We found that 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx = ln 2 + (π/2 -1).

Then, -0.5 ∫₀² ln x dx = - ( -ln 2 +1 ) = ln 2 -1.

Therefore, total I = (ln 2 + π/2 -1) + (ln 2 -1) = 2 ln 2 + π/2 -2.

Wait, this contradicts the previous result of π/2. Therefore, there must be a mistake in this approach.

Wait, let's recheck:

First integral: 0.5 ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 -x²)) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} [ln 2 + ln(1 + cosθ)] cosθ dθ.

Which splits into ln 2 ∫₀^{π/2} cosθ dθ + ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1 + cosθ) cosθ dθ.

First part: ln 2 * 1.

Second part: π/2 -1.

So total first integral: ln 2 + π/2 -1.

Second integral: -0.5 ∫₀² ln x dx = -0.5 [x ln x -x]₀² = -0.5 [ (2 ln 2 -2) -0 ] = -0.5 (2 ln 2 -2) = -ln 2 +1.

Therefore, total I = (ln 2 + π/2 -1) + (-ln 2 +1) = π/2.

Yes, the terms cancel out: ln 2 - ln 2, -1 +1, leaving π/2. Therefore, the original integral I = π/2.

Therefore, the exact answer is π/2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.5707963268.

But earlier, when I thought the answer was π/4, that was a mistake. The correct analytical result is π/2.

Therefore, the final answer is {"answer": "\frac{\pi}{2}", "numerical_answer": "1.5707963268"}.
