Okay, let's tackle this integral: ∫₀^∞ {x}^⌈x⌉ / (1 + ⌈x⌉) dx. Hmm, first, I need to understand the components here. The function {x} is the fractional part of x, which is x minus the floor of x, right? And ⌈x⌉ is the ceiling function, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So for any real number x, ⌈x⌉ is the integer part above x. 

Since the integral is from 0 to infinity, I should probably break it into intervals where the ceiling function is constant. Because the ceiling function ⌈x⌉ increases by 1 at each integer. So for example, between n-1 and n, where n is an integer, the ceiling function would be n. Wait, actually, let me check. If x is in [n, n+1), then ⌈x⌉ is n+1? Wait, no. Wait, if x is in [0,1), then ⌈x⌉ is 1. If x is in [1,2), ⌈x⌉ is 2, and so on. So in general, for x in [n, n+1), where n is a non-negative integer, ⌈x⌉ is n+1. So the integral can be split into a sum over n from 0 to infinity of the integral from n to n+1 of {x}^{n+1}/(n+2) dx. 

Wait, let me confirm. Let's take x in [n, n+1). Then ⌈x⌉ is n+1. The fractional part {x} is x - floor(x). Since x is in [n, n+1), floor(x) is n, so {x} = x - n. Therefore, the integrand becomes (x - n)^{n+1}/(n + 2). So the integral from 0 to infinity is the sum from n=0 to infinity of the integral from n to n+1 of (x - n)^{n+1}/(n + 2) dx. 

So each term in the sum is ∫ₙ^{n+1} (x - n)^{n+1}/(n + 2) dx. Let's make a substitution here. Let t = x - n. Then when x = n, t = 0, and when x = n+1, t = 1. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ t^{n+1}/(n + 2) dt. The integral of t^{n+1} from 0 to 1 is [t^{n+2}/(n + 2)] from 0 to 1, which is 1/(n + 2). Therefore, each term in the sum is (1/(n + 2)) * (1/(n + 2)) = 1/(n + 2)^2. 

So the entire integral is the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/(n + 2)^2. Let's rewrite that sum. Let k = n + 2. Then when n=0, k=2, and as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity. So the sum becomes sum_{k=2}^∞ 1/k². But we know that the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k² is π²/6. Therefore, the sum from k=2 to infinity is π²/6 - 1/1² = π²/6 - 1. 

Wait, let me check that again. The sum from k=1 to ∞ of 1/k² is ζ(2) = π²/6. So the sum_{k=2}^∞ 1/k² = ζ(2) - 1/1² = π²/6 - 1. Therefore, the integral is π²/6 - 1. 

But wait, let me verify each step again. The substitution step: when we have ∫ₙ^{n+1} (x - n)^{n+1}/(n + 2) dx, substitution t = x - n, dt = dx. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ t^{n+1}/(n + 2) dt. The integral of t^{n+1} is t^{n+2}/(n + 2) evaluated from 0 to 1, which is 1/(n + 2). Then multiplying by 1/(n + 2) gives 1/(n + 2)^2. So each term is 1/(n + 2)^2. Then sum from n=0 to ∞ of 1/(n + 2)^2. 

Yes, so shifting the index: let m = n + 2, so when n=0, m=2, and the sum becomes sum_{m=2}^∞ 1/m². Which is sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/m² - 1/1² = π²/6 - 1. Therefore, the exact value of the integral is π²/6 - 1. 

Now, the numerical approximation. π² is approximately (3.1415926536)^2 ≈ 9.8696044011. Then π²/6 ≈ 9.8696044011 / 6 ≈ 1.6449340668. Subtract 1 gives 0.6449340668. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.6449340668. 

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute π²/6 - 1. π is approximately 3.141592653589793. Squaring that gives π² ≈ 9.869604401089358. Divide by 6: 9.869604401089358 / 6 ≈ 1.6449340668482264. Then subtract 1: 1.6449340668482264 - 1 = 0.6449340668482264. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.6449340668. 

So the exact answer is π²/6 - 1, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.6449340668. 

Therefore, the final answer should be {"answer": "\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1", "numerical_answer": 0.6449340668}.
