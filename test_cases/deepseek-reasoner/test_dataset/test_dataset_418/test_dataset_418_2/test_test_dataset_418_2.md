Okay, let's tackle this integral: the definite integral from 0 to infinity of {x}^{ceil(x)} divided by (1 + ceil(x)) dx. Hmm, so the integrand is {x}^ceil(x)/(1 + ceil(x)), where {x} is the fractional part of x, and ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the fractional part {x} is defined as x minus the floor of x. But here, we have ceil(x). Wait, but ceil(x) is related to floor(x). For non-integer x, ceil(x) is floor(x) + 1. For integer x, ceil(x) is just x. So maybe we can split the integral into intervals where ceil(x) is constant. Since ceil(x) = n when x is in [n-1, n) for each integer n ≥ 1. Wait, actually, if x is in [0,1), then ceil(x) is 1. In [1,2), ceil(x) is 2, and so on. So the integral from 0 to infinity can be written as the sum of integrals over each interval [n-1, n) for n starting from 1 to infinity.

So, the integral becomes the sum from n=1 to infinity of the integral from n-1 to n of {x}^n / (1 + n) dx. Wait, but {x} in the interval [n-1, n) is x - (n-1), right? Because the fractional part of x is x minus the floor(x), and floor(x) in [n-1, n) is n-1. So {x} = x - (n - 1) = x is in [n-1, n), so floor(x) is n-1, so {x} = x - (n-1). Therefore, in each interval [n-1, n), the integrand becomes (x - (n -1))^n / (1 + n) dx.

Therefore, the integral is the sum from n=1 to infinity of [1/(n+1)] * integral from n-1 to n of (x - n +1)^n dx. Let's make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let t = x - (n -1). Then when x = n -1, t = 0, and when x = n, t = 1. So the integral becomes [1/(n+1)] * integral from 0 to 1 of t^n dt. The integral of t^n from 0 to1 is [t^{n+1}/(n+1)] from 0 to1, which is 1/(n+1). Therefore, each term in the sum is [1/(n+1)] * [1/(n+1)] = 1/(n+1)^2.

Therefore, the entire integral is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(n+1)^2. Let's adjust the index. Let k = n +1. Then when n=1, k=2, and as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity. So the sum becomes sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/k^2. But we know that the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k^2 is π²/6. Therefore, the sum from k=2 to infinity is π²/6 - 1. So the value of the integral is π²/6 - 1, which is π²/6 - 1? Wait, wait. Wait, the sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/k² is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k² - 1/1² = π²/6 -1. So the integral equals π²/6 -1.

Wait, let me check that. The original sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n+1)^2. Let n+1 = m, so m starts at 2. So sum_{m=2}^∞ 1/m². Which is sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/m² - 1/1² = π²/6 -1. So yes, the integral is π²/6 -1. That seems right.

But let me verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the sum of 1/(n+1)^2 from n=1 to, say, 1000, and see if it's close to π²/6 -1. Let's compute π²/6 ≈ (9.8696)/6 ≈ 1.6449, so π²/6 -1 ≈ 0.6449. If we compute the sum from n=1 to 1000 of 1/(n+1)^2, that's sum from k=2 to 1001 of 1/k². The sum from k=1 to 1001 is approximately 1.6439 (since sum up to 1000 is about 1.6439, but let's not get too precise here). Then subtract 1 gives approximately 0.6439, which is close to 0.6449. Wait, but π²/6 is approximately 1.6449, so π²/6 -1 is approximately 0.6449, which is about 0.6449. So the numerical approximation would be around 0.6449...

But let me check with actual calculation. Let's compute sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(n+1)^2 = sum_{k=2}^\infty 1/k^2 = π²/6 -1. So the exact answer is π²/6 -1, and the approximate value is approximately 0.644934066848...

So the exact answer is π²/6 -1, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.644934066848..., which rounds to 0.6449340668 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Wait, the problem says to compute the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places. Let me confirm with a calculator. π² is approximately 9.8696044, so divided by 6 is approximately 1.644934066666..., minus 1 gives 0.644934066666..., so rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.6449340667. Wait, but depending on the exact value of π², let's check more precisely. π² is approximately 9.869604401089358, so divided by 6 is approximately 1.6449340668482263, subtract 1 gives 0.6449340668482263. So to 10 decimal places, that's 0.6449340668. So the numerical answer is approximately 0.6449340668.

Therefore, the exact answer is π²/6 -1, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.6449340668.

So putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Recognize that the integral can be split into intervals [n-1, n) for n=1,2,...

2. On each interval, {x} = x - (n-1), and ceil(x) = n.

3. Substitute t = x - (n-1) to convert each integral to the integral from 0 to1 of t^n / (n+1) dt.

4. Compute the integral of t^n from 0 to1, which is 1/(n+1).

5. Multiply by 1/(n+1) to get 1/(n+1)^2 per term.

6. Sum over n from1 to infinity, which is sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/k^2 = π²/6 -1.

7. Numerical approximation is approximately 0.6449340668.

Therefore, the final answer is π²/6 -1, and the numerical value is approximately 0.6449340668.
