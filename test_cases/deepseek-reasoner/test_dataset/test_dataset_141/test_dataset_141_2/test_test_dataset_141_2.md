Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times the natural logarithm of (1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²)) multiplied by the modified Bessel function I₀(2x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what I know about modified Bessel functions. The modified Bessel function of the first kind, I₀(z), has a series representation. Maybe expanding I₀(2x) into its series could help. The integral involves a logarithmic term, so perhaps integration by parts is necessary. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that simplifies the expression.

Looking at the logarithm part: ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))]. That seems similar to the inverse hyperbolic functions. Let me check: the expression inside the log can be simplified. Let me set y = sqrt(1 - x²). Then the argument of the log becomes (1 + y)/(1 - y). The logarithm of that is 2 artanh(y), since artanh(z) = ½ ln[(1+z)/(1-z)]. So, ln[(1 + y)/(1 - y)] = 2 artanh(y). Therefore, the integrand becomes x * 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) * I₀(2x).

So the integral simplifies to 2∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) I₀(2x) dx. Hmm, artanh(sqrt(1 - x²))... Maybe another substitution would help here. Let me consider substituting t = sqrt(1 - x²). Then, t² = 1 - x², so x dx = -t dt. Wait, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 1 to 0. So changing variables to t might reverse the limits, but the negative sign would flip them back. Let's try that substitution.

Let t = sqrt(1 - x²). Then, x = sqrt(1 - t²), and dx = (-t)/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Wait, maybe I need to express x dx in terms of t. Let's compute dt/dx: dt/dx = (1/(2 sqrt(1 - x²)))(-2x) = -x / sqrt(1 - x²). Therefore, dx = -sqrt(1 - x²)/x dt. But since t = sqrt(1 - x²), then dx = -t/x dt. But x = sqrt(1 - t²), so dx = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Hmm, this might complicate things. Let me see the integral in terms of t.

Original integral: 2∫₀¹ x artanh(t) I₀(2x) dx. With substitution t = sqrt(1 - x²), x = sqrt(1 - t²), dx = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. So substituting, the integral becomes 2∫₁⁰ sqrt(1 - t²) artanh(t) I₀(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. The negative sign flips the limits back to 0 to 1, and the sqrt(1 - t²) cancels with the denominator. So we have 2∫₀¹ t artanh(t) I₀(2 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps express artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) in another form. Let me recall that artanh(z) can be expressed as a series. For |z| < 1, artanh(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n+1}/(2n+1). But sqrt(1 - x²) is between 0 and 1 for x in [0,1], so maybe expanding artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) as a series. Then, the integral becomes 2∫₀¹ x [Σ_{n=0}^∞ (sqrt(1 - x²))^{2n+1}/(2n+1)] I₀(2x) dx. If I can interchange the sum and the integral, then maybe each term can be integrated separately. But integrating x times (1 - x²)^{n + 0.5} times I₀(2x) might not be straightforward. However, perhaps there's a known integral formula involving Bessel functions and polynomials.

Alternatively, maybe using integral representations of the Bessel function. The modified Bessel function I₀(2x) can be represented as an integral: I₀(2x) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} dθ. If I substitute this into the original integral, then the integral becomes 2/(π) ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) ∫₀^π e^{2x cosθ} dθ dx. Then, switching the order of integration: 2/π ∫₀^π ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) e^{2x cosθ} dx dθ. But I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe another approach.

Wait, let's consider the original integrand: x ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] I₀(2x). Let me check if there's a substitution that can simplify the logarithm term. Let me set u = x². Then du = 2x dx, so x dx = du/2. But the logarithm term becomes ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - u))/(1 - sqrt(1 - u))]. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe substitution v = sqrt(1 - x²). Then, as before, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, let's consider hypergeometric functions. The modified Bessel function I₀(2x) can be expressed as a hypergeometric function: I₀(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k})/(k!²). So maybe expanding I₀(2x) as a series and then term-by-term integration. Let's try that.

So, I₀(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k})/(k!²). Then, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ x ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] Σ_{k=0}^∞ (x^{2k})/(k!²) dx. Interchanging sum and integral (if permissible), we get Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k!²)] ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 1} ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] dx. Let me focus on the integral inside: ∫₀¹ x^{2k + 1} ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] dx. Let me make substitution t = x². Then, dt = 2x dx, so x dx = dt/2. When x=0, t=0; x=1, t=1. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ t^{k} (1/2) ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - t))/(1 - sqrt(1 - t))] dt. So, (1/2) ∫₀¹ t^k ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - t))/(1 - sqrt(1 - t))] dt. Let me denote this integral as (1/2) J_k, where J_k = ∫₀¹ t^k ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - t))/(1 - sqrt(1 - t))] dt.

Now, let's focus on J_k. Let me make substitution u = sqrt(1 - t). Then, t = 1 - u², dt = -2u du. When t=0, u=1; t=1, u=0. So, J_k becomes ∫₁⁰ (1 - u²)^k ln[(1 + u)/(1 - u)] (-2u) du = 2 ∫₀¹ u (1 - u²)^k ln[(1 + u)/(1 - u)] du. Then, ln[(1 + u)/(1 - u)] = 2 artanh(u), so J_k = 4 ∫₀¹ u (1 - u²)^k artanh(u) du. Hmm, integrating u (1 - u²)^k artanh(u) du. Maybe integrating by parts. Let me set v = artanh(u), dv = 1/(1 - u²) du. Then, du = dv (1 - u²). Let me set dw = u (1 - u²)^k du. Then, integrating dw: Let me compute the integral of u (1 - u²)^k du. Let me set z = 1 - u², dz = -2u du. So, u du = -dz/2. Then, ∫ u (1 - u²)^k du = -1/(2(k+1)) (1 - u²)^{k+1} + C. Therefore, w = -1/(2(k+1)) (1 - u²)^{k+1}.

So, integrating by parts: J_k = 4 [ w artanh(u) |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ w dv ]. Let's compute the boundary terms first. At u=1, artanh(u) tends to infinity, but (1 - u²)^{k+1} is zero. So, the term at u=1 is 0 * ∞, which needs to be evaluated carefully. Let me see: as u approaches 1 from below, (1 - u²)^{k+1} approaches 0, and artanh(u) approaches infinity. The product might be zero if the limit as u→1- of (1 - u²)^{k+1} artanh(u) is zero. Let's check: 1 - u² = (1 - u)(1 + u) ≈ 2(1 - u) near u≈1. So, (1 - u²)^{k+1} ≈ (2(1 - u))^{k+1}. artanh(u) ≈ -½ ln(1 - u) + ... So, the product is (2^{k+1} (1 - u)^{k+1}) ) * (-½ ln(1 - u)). As u→1-, (1 - u)^{k+1} ln(1 - u) tends to 0 because the polynomial term (1 - u)^{k+1} goes to zero faster than the logarithm term goes to negative infinity. Therefore, the boundary term at u=1 is zero. At u=0, artanh(0) = 0, so the term is zero. Therefore, J_k = -4 ∫₀¹ w dv. But dv = 1/(1 - u²) du, and w = -1/(2(k+1)) (1 - u²)^{k+1}. Therefore, J_k = -4 [ -1/(2(k+1)) ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^{k+1} * 1/(1 - u²) du ] = -4 [ -1/(2(k+1)) ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du ] = 4/(2(k+1)) ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du = 2/(k+1) ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du.

Now, compute ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du. This is a standard Beta function integral. Let me substitute u = sinθ, so when u=0, θ=0; u=1, θ=π/2. Then, du = cosθ dθ, and (1 - u²)^k = cos^{2k}θ. So, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cos^{2k}θ cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} cos^{2k + 1}θ dθ. The integral of cos^{n}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n+1)/2)/Γ((n+2)/2). For n = 2k + 1, this becomes (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Therefore, ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du = (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Therefore, J_k = 2/(k + 1) * (sqrt(π)/2) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π)/(k + 1) * Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2).

Recall that Γ(k + 1) = k! and Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 1/2) Γ(k + 1/2). Also, Γ(k + 1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2k}) (2k)! ) /k! ). Wait, let me recall the duplication formula: Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express Γ(k + 3/2) in terms of factorials. For integer k, Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 1/2)(k - 1/2)...(1/2) sqrt(π). Alternatively, Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 1)!! / 2^{k + 1} sqrt(π). Wait, perhaps using the relation Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π))/(4^n n!). So, Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ((k + 1) + 1/2) = (2(k + 1))! sqrt(π))/(4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!)). Wait, no. Let me check for n = k + 1: Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! sqrt(π))/(4^n n!). So, Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ((k + 1) + 1/2) = (2(k + 1))! sqrt(π))/(4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!)). Therefore, Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 2)! sqrt(π))/(4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!)). But (2k + 2)! = (2k + 2)(2k + 1)!.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ratio Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Let's write it as Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = [k! ] / [ (k + 1/2) Γ(k + 1/2) ) ].

But Γ(k + 1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^{2k}) (2k)! ) /k! ). So, substituting:

Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = k! / [ (k + 1/2) * (sqrt(π)/2^{2k}) (2k)! /k! ) ] = k! * k! * 2^{2k} / [ (k + 1/2) sqrt(π) (2k)! ) ].

But (2k)! = (2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1)k! So, the ratio becomes:

[ k!² 2^{2k} ] / [ (k + 1/2) sqrt(π) (2k)! ) ].

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's recall that Beta function B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). The integral ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du can also be written as (1/2) B(1/2, k + 1). Because substituting t = u², then du = (1/(2√t)) dt, so the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀¹ t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^k dt = (1/2) B(1/2, k + 1) = (1/2) Γ(1/2)Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Since Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), this gives the same result as before. Therefore, ∫₀¹ (1 - u²)^k du = (1/2) sqrt(π) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2). Therefore, J_k = 2/(k + 1) * (1/2) sqrt(π) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = sqrt(π)/(k + 1) Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2).

But Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 1)!! / 2^{k + 1} sqrt(π). Wait, maybe using the relation Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 2)! / (4^{k + 1} (k + 1)!)) sqrt(π). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, using the ratio Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / ( (2k + 1)! ) sqrt(π) ). Wait, perhaps using the duplication formula. The duplication formula says Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} sqrt(π) Γ(2z). Let me set z = k + 1. Then Γ(k + 1)Γ(k + 3/2) = 2^{1 - 2(k + 1)} sqrt(π) Γ(2k + 2). Therefore, Γ(k + 3/2) = [2^{1 - 2k - 2} sqrt(π) Γ(2k + 2)] / Γ(k + 1). Therefore, Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = Γ(k + 1)^2 / [2^{-2k -1} sqrt(π) Γ(2k + 2)].

But Γ(2k + 2) = (2k + 1)! So, Γ(k + 1)/Γ(k + 3/2) = (k! )² / [2^{-2k -1} sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) ] = (k! )² 2^{2k + 1} / [ sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) ].

Therefore, J_k = sqrt(π)/(k + 1) * (k! )² 2^{2k + 1} / [ sqrt(π) (2k + 1)! ) ] = (k! )² 2^{2k + 1} / [ (k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ].

Simplifying this expression: (k! )² 2^{2k + 1} / [ (k + 1) (2k + 1)! ) ].

Note that (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! and (2k)! = (2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1)k! So, (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! = (2k + 1)(2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1)k! ). But maybe we can write (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) as 1 / [ (2k + 1) choose k ) (k + 1) ) ]? Not sure. Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! and (2k)! = 2^k k! (2k - 1)!!. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let's write 2^{2k + 1} = 2 * 4^k. So, J_k = 2 * 4^k (k! )² / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ].

But (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! and (2k)! = (2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1)k! So, (2k)! = k! * product_{i=1}^k (k + i). Therefore, (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1) k! product_{i=1}^k (k + i). Therefore, (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) = k! / [ (2k + 1) product_{i=1}^k (k + i) ) ] = 1 / [ (2k + 1) product_{i=1}^k (k + i)/k! ) ].

But product_{i=1}^k (k + i) = (k + 1)(k + 2)...(2k) = (2k)! / k! ). Therefore, (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) = k!² / [ (2k + 1) (2k)! ) ] = k!² / [ (2k + 1) (2k)! ) ].

But (2k)! = (2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1)k! ), so (2k)! /k! = (2k)(2k - 1)...(k + 1) = 2^k k! product_{i=1}^k (2i - 1). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, (2k)! = 2^k k! (2k - 1)!!. Therefore, (2k)! = 2^k k! (2k - 1)!!. Therefore, (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) = (k! )² / [ (2k + 1) 2^k k! (2k - 1)!! ) ] = k! / [ (2k + 1) 2^k (2k - 1)!! ) ].

But (2k - 1)!! = (2k)! ) / (2^k k! ). Therefore, substituting back, we get k! / [ (2k + 1) 2^k ( (2k)! ) / (2^k k! ) ) ] = k! * 2^k k! / [ (2k + 1) 2^k (2k)! ) ] = (k! )² / [ (2k + 1)(2k)! ) ].

This seems to loop back. Maybe it's better to leave J_k as 2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ].

So, going back to the original integral. The original integral was 2∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) I₀(2x) dx. After expanding I₀(2x) as a series, we had the integral equal to Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k!²)] * (1/2) J_k. Wait, no. Wait, the original integral after substitution became Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k!²)] * (1/2) J_k. Because the integral inside was (1/2) J_k. So, the total integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k!²)] * (1/2) J_k = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(k!²)] * (1/2) * [2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) ].

Simplifying this expression: (1/2) * 2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / (k!² (k + 1)(2k + 1)! )) = (1/2) * 2^{2k + 1} / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ) = 2^{2k} / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ).

Therefore, the original integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k} / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ].

Now, let's see if this series can be summed up. Let me write out the first few terms to see a pattern. For k=0: 2^0 / (1 * 1! ) = 1/1 = 1. For k=1: 2^2 / (2 * 3! ) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4/12 = 1/3. For k=2: 2^4 / (3 * 5! ) = 16 / (3 * 120) = 16/360 = 2/45. For k=3: 2^6 / (4 * 7! ) = 64 / (4 * 5040) = 64/20160 = 1/315. Hmm, not obvious. Let me see if this series matches a known function.

Alternatively, perhaps recognizing the series as part of the expansion of sinh(2) or something similar. Let me recall that sinh(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k + 1}/( (2k + 1)! ). So, sinh(2) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k + 1}/( (2k + 1)! ). Comparing with our series: Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k}/( (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ). Hmm, not directly. But maybe integrating sinh(2x) or differentiating.

Alternatively, consider that the term 2^{2k}/( (2k + 1)! ) is similar to terms in sinh(2), but divided by (k + 1). Let me see: Let's write the sum as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2^{2k}) / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (4^k) / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ].

Let me make a substitution m = k + 1. Then, k = m - 1, so the sum becomes Σ_{m=1}^∞ 4^{m - 1} / [ m (2(m - 1) + 1)! ) ] = Σ_{m=1}^∞ 4^{m - 1} / [ m (2m - 1)! ) ] = (1/4) Σ_{m=1}^∞ 4^m / [ m (2m - 1)! ) ].

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express 1/(m (2m - 1)! ) as an integral. Recall that 1/(2m - 1)! ) = ∫₀¹ t^{2m - 1} e^{-t} dt / (e^{-t} ), but not sure. Alternatively, note that 1/m = ∫₀¹ t^{m - 1} dt. So, 1/(m (2m - 1)! ) = ∫₀¹ t^{m - 1} dt / (2m - 1)! ). Then, the sum becomes (1/4) Σ_{m=1}^∞ 4^m ∫₀¹ t^{m - 1} / (2m - 1)! ) dt = (1/4) ∫₀¹ Σ_{m=1}^∞ (4^m t^{m - 1}) / (2m - 1)! ) dt.

Let me change the index to n = m - 1. Then, m = n + 1, and the sum becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4^{n + 1} t^n ) / (2(n + 1) - 1)! ) = 4 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4^n t^n ) / (2n + 1)! ). So, the integral becomes (1/4) ∫₀¹ 4 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4^n t^n ) / (2n + 1)! ) dt = ∫₀¹ Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4^n t^n ) / (2n + 1)! ) dt.

But Σ_{n=0}^∞ (4^n t^n ) / (2n + 1)! ) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (2 sqrt(t))^{2n} ) / (2n + 1)! ). Let me set z = 2 sqrt(t). Then, z^{2n} = (2 sqrt(t))^{2n} = 4^n t^n. So, the sum becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n} / (2n + 1)! ) = (1/z) Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n + 1} / (2n + 1)! ) = sinh(z)/z. Because sinh(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n + 1}/(2n + 1)! ). Therefore, Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n}/(2n + 1)! ) = sinh(z)/z. Therefore, substituting back z = 2 sqrt(t), we have sinh(2 sqrt(t))/(2 sqrt(t)).

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ sinh(2 sqrt(t))/(2 sqrt(t)) dt. Let me make substitution u = sqrt(t), so t = u², dt = 2u du. When t=0, u=0; t=1, u=1. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ sinh(2u)/(2u) * 2u du = ∫₀¹ sinh(2u) du. The 2u cancels with the denominator and the 2u from dt. So, integral becomes ∫₀¹ sinh(2u) du = [ (cosh(2u)/2) ]₀¹ = (cosh(2) - 1)/2.

Therefore, the original sum Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{2k} / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ] equals (cosh(2) - 1)/2. Therefore, the original integral is equal to (cosh(2) - 1)/2.

But wait, cosh(2) - 1 = 2 sinh²(1), since cosh(2x) = 1 + 2 sinh²(x). So, cosh(2) - 1 = 2 sinh²(1). Therefore, (cosh(2) - 1)/2 = sinh²(1). Therefore, the original integral equals sinh²(1).

But sinh(1) = (e - e^{-1})/2, so sinh²(1) = (e² - 2 + e^{-2})/4. Therefore, the exact value is sinh²(1).

Wait, let me verify this conclusion. The integral was transformed into a series which summed up to (cosh(2) - 1)/2, which is indeed sinh²(1). Because cosh(2) = 1 + 2 sinh²(1), so sinh²(1) = (cosh(2) - 1)/2. Therefore, the original integral equals sinh²(1).

Therefore, the exact answer is sinh²(1), which can be written as \sinh^2(1).

Now, compute the numerical approximation. sinh(1) is approximately (e - 1/e)/2 ≈ (2.718281828459045 - 0.36787944117144233)/2 ≈ (2.3504023872876027)/2 ≈ 1.1752011936438014. Squaring this gives approximately (1.1752011936438014)^2 ≈ 1.381097845541815. Let me compute this more accurately.

First, compute e ≈ 2.71828182845904523536, so 1/e ≈ 0.36787944117144232159. Then, e - 1/e ≈ 2.71828182845904523536 - 0.36787944117144232159 ≈ 2.35040238728760291377. Divide by 2: ≈ 1.17520119364380145688. Square this: 1.17520119364380145688^2. Let's compute:

1.1752^2 = (1 + 0.1752)^2 = 1 + 2*0.1752 + 0.1752^2 ≈ 1 + 0.3504 + 0.0307 ≈ 1.3811. But to get more precise:

1.17520119364380145688 * 1.17520119364380145688:

Let me use more decimal places:

First, compute 1.17520119364380145688 * 1.17520119364380145688.

Let me approximate:

Let a = 1.17520119364380145688

Compute a^2:

= (1 + 0.17520119364380145688)^2

= 1^2 + 2*1*0.17520119364380145688 + (0.17520119364380145688)^2

= 1 + 0.35040238728760291376 + (0.17520119364380145688)^2

Compute the square term:

0.17520119364380145688^2 ≈ 0.0306953810556275
