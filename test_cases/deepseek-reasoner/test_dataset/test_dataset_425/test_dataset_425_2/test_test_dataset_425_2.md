Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (x-1)^2(x+1)^2(x^2+1)^2(x^4+1)^2 dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those squared terms. Let me try to simplify the integrand first before integrating.

Starting with the first part: (x-1)^2(x+1)^2. I remember that (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², so maybe I can apply that here. Let me check: (x-1)(x+1) is x² - 1, so squaring that gives (x² - 1)^2. So, (x-1)^2(x+1)^2 = (x² - 1)^2. That simplifies the first part.

Now the integrand is (x² - 1)^2 * (x² + 1)^2 * (x^4 + 1)^2. Let me see if I can multiply these terms step by step. Let's start with (x² - 1)^2 * (x² + 1)^2. Maybe combine them similarly. Let me write (x² - 1)(x² + 1) first, which is (x^4 - 1), so (x² - 1)^2*(x² + 1)^2 = [(x² - 1)(x² + 1)]^2 = (x^4 - 1)^2. So now the integrand becomes (x^4 - 1)^2 * (x^4 + 1)^2.

Again, using the same pattern: (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) = x^8 - 1. Therefore, (x^4 - 1)^2*(x^4 + 1)^2 = [(x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1)]^2 = (x^8 - 1)^2. So the entire original integrand simplifies to (x^8 - 1)^2. That's a lot simpler!

So now the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x^8 - 1)^2 dx. Let me expand that square. (x^8 - 1)^2 = x^16 - 2x^8 + 1. So the integral is ∫₀¹ (x^16 - 2x^8 + 1) dx. That's much easier to integrate term by term.

Let's integrate each term separately. The integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). So:

∫x^16 dx from 0 to 1 is [x^17 / 17] from 0 to 1 = 1/17 - 0 = 1/17.

∫-2x^8 dx from 0 to 1 is -2 * [x^9 / 9] from 0 to 1 = -2*(1/9 - 0) = -2/9.

∫1 dx from 0 to 1 is [x] from 0 to 1 = 1 - 0 = 1.

Adding them all together: 1/17 - 2/9 + 1. Let me compute that. First, combine 1/17 and -2/9. To add these fractions, find a common denominator. 17 and 9 have LCM of 153. So 1/17 = 9/153, and -2/9 = -34/153. So 9/153 - 34/153 = -25/153. Then add 1, which is 153/153. So total is (-25 + 153)/153 = 128/153.

Wait, that seems like the exact answer. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original integrand simplified to (x^8 -1)^2 = x^16 - 2x^8 +1. Integrate term by term:

Integral of x^16 from 0 to1: 1/17.

Integral of -2x^8: -2*(1/9).

Integral of 1: 1.

So 1/17 - 2/9 +1. Let me compute 1/17 as approximately 0.0588, 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. So 0.0588 - 0.2222 = -0.1634, then +1 gives 0.8366. But let's do it fractionally:

1/17 - 2/9 +1 = (9/153 - 34/153) + 153/153 = (-25/153) + 153/153 = (128/153). Because 153 -25 is 128. So 128/153. Let me check if that reduces. 128 and 153: 128 is 2^7, 153 is 9*17. No common factors, so 128/153 is the simplified fraction. So the exact answer is 128/153.

Now, converting that to a decimal. Let's compute 128 divided by 153. Let me do the division. 153 goes into 128 zero times. 153 goes into 1280 eight times (153*8=1224). 1280 -1224=56. Bring down a zero: 560. 153*3=459. 560-459=101. Bring down a zero: 1010. 153*6=918. 1010-918=92. Bring down a zero: 920. 153*6=918. 920-918=2. Bring down a zero: 20. 153 goes into 20 zero times. Bring down a zero: 200. 153*1=153. 200-153=47. Bring down a zero: 470. 153*3=459. 470-459=11. Bring down a zero: 110. 153*0=0. So it's 0.836601307189542... So rounding to 10 decimal places: 0.8366013072.

Wait, let me check the division again step by step to ensure accuracy.

128 ÷ 153:

128 divided by 153 is 0. So 0.

128.0000000000

153 goes into 1280 8 times (8*153=1224). Subtract: 1280-1224=56. Bring down 0: 560.

153 into 560: 3 times (3*153=459). 560-459=101. Bring down 0: 1010.

153 into 1010: 6 times (6*153=918). 1010-918=92. Bring down 0: 920.

153 into 920: 6 times (6*153=918). 920-918=2. Bring down 0: 20.

153 into 20: 0. Bring down 0: 200.

153 into 200: 1 time (153). 200-153=47. Bring down 0: 470.

153 into 470: 3 times (3*153=459). 470-459=11. Bring down 0: 110.

153 into 110: 0. Bring down 0: 1100.

153 into 1100: 7 times (7*153=1071). 1100-1071=29. Bring down 0: 290.

153 into 290: 1 time (153). 290-153=137. Bring down 0: 1370.

153 into 1370: 8 times (8*153=1224). 1370-1224=146. Bring down 0: 1460.

153 into 1460: 9 times (9*153=1377). 1460-1377=83. Bring down 0: 830.

153 into 830: 5 times (5*153=765). 830-765=65. Bring down 0: 650.

153 into 650: 4 times (4*153=612). 650-612=38. Bring down 0: 380.

153 into 380: 2 times (2*153=306). 380-306=74. Bring down 0: 740.

153 into 740: 4 times (4*153=612). 740-612=128. Now we see a repetition of 128, so the decimal repeats from here.

But up to 10 decimal places, after the decimal point:

0.836601307189542... So up to 10 decimal places, it's 0.8366013072. Wait, let's check the digits:

After the decimal:

First 8 digits after 0. are 8 (from 8*153=1224), then 3, 6, 6, 0, 1, 3, 0, 7, 1, etc. Wait, let me recount:

Wait, the division steps:

First, 0.8 (8*153=1224, remainder 56)

Then 3: 0.83 (3*153=459, remainder 101)

Then 6: 0.836 (6*153=918, remainder 92)

Then 6: 0.8366 (6*153=918, remainder 2)

Then 0: 0.83660 (0*153, remainder 20)

Then 1: 0.836601 (1*153=153, remainder 47)

Then 3: 0.8366013 (3*153=459, remainder 11)

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me write the decimal digits step by step:

1. 0.

2. 8 (153*8=1224, 1280-1224=56)

3. 3 (56*10=560, 153*3=459, 560-459=101)

4. 6 (101*10=1010, 153*6=918, 1010-918=92)

5. 6 (92*10=920, 153*6=918, 920-918=2)

6. 0 (2*10=20, 153*0=0, remainder 20)

7. 1 (20*10=200, 153*1=153, remainder 47)

8. 3 (47*10=470, 153*3=459, remainder 11)

9. 0 (11*10=110, 153*0=0, remainder 110)

10. 7 (110*10=1100, 153*7=1071, remainder 29)

So up to 10 decimal places: 0.8366013071... So the 10th decimal place is the 7th digit after the decimal? Wait, no. Wait, the first digit after decimal is 8 (position 1), then 3 (2), 6 (3), 6 (4), 0 (5), 1 (6), 3 (7), 0 (8), 7 (9), 1 (10). Wait, no, let me count again:

Wait, the decimal expansion is:

After 0., the digits are:

1: 8

2: 3

3: 6

4: 6

5: 0

6: 1

7: 3

8: 0

9: 7

10: 1

Wait, that's up to the 10th decimal place. So 0.8366013071... So rounding to 10 decimal places would be 0.8366013071. But wait, when we look at the 11th digit, which is the next one after 1, which is from the remainder 29, which would be 153*1=153, so 29*10=290, 153*1=153, remainder 137, so next digit is 1. So 0.83660130711... So up to 10 decimal places, it's 0.8366013071. But wait, the 10th decimal place is the 10th digit. Let me check:

Digits:

1:8

2:3

3:6

4:6

5:0

6:1

7:3

8:0

9:7

10:1

So the 10th decimal digit is 1. But when you round, you look at the 11th digit. The 11th digit is 8 (from the next step: after 1100-1071=29, then 29*10=290, 153*1=153, remainder 137, so digit 10 is 1, then next digit (11th) is 8 (137*10=1370, 153*8=1224, remainder 146). So 8. So the 11th digit is 8. Wait, but the 10th digit is 1, followed by 8. So when rounding to 10 decimal places, 0.83660130718... So 0.83660130718... rounded to 10 decimals would be 0.8366013072. Because the 11th digit is 8, which is >=5, so we round up the 10th digit from 1 to 2. Wait, but wait, the 10th digit is the 10th after the decimal. Let me check again:

Wait, the decimal expansion up to 10 digits is 0.8366013071, and the 11th digit is 8. So when rounding, we add 1 to the 10th digit, making it 0.8366013072. So the numerical approximation is 0.8366013072.

Therefore, the exact answer is 128/153, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8366013072.

Let me just verify once more that the integral steps are correct. Starting with expanding (x-1)^2(x+1)^2 to (x² -1)^2, then multiplied by (x² +1)^2 gives (x^4 -1)^2, then multiplied by (x^4 +1)^2 gives (x^8 -1)^2. Then expanding that to x^16 - 2x^8 +1. Integrating term by term from 0 to1 gives 1/17 -2/9 +1 = 128/153. Yes, that seems correct. So the exact answer is 128/153, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8366013072.
