Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (x-1)^2(x+1)^2(x^2+1)^2(x^4+1)^2 dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those terms multiplied together. Let me try to simplify the integrand first before integrating.

Starting with the first two factors: (x - 1)^2(x + 1)^2. I remember that (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², so maybe I can apply that here. Let me compute (x - 1)(x + 1) first. That would be x² - 1. Then squaring that gives (x² - 1)^2. So, (x - 1)^2(x + 1)^2 simplifies to (x² - 1)^2. That's a part of the integrand.

Now the next term is (x² + 1)^2. So now the integrand is (x² - 1)^2(x² + 1)^2. Let me see if I can combine these two. Again, using the difference of squares formula: (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². If I let a = x² and b = 1, then (x² - 1)(x² + 1) = x⁴ - 1. Therefore, (x² - 1)^2(x² + 1)^2 would be [(x² - 1)(x² + 1)]² = (x⁴ - 1)^2. So now the integrand becomes (x⁴ - 1)^2 times the next term, which is (x⁴ + 1)^2.

So, putting it all together: (x⁴ - 1)^2(x⁴ + 1)^2. Again, this looks like another difference of squares. Let me apply the same formula here. Let a = x⁴ - 1 and b = x⁴ + 1? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the product (a - b)(a + b) is a² - b², but here we have (x⁴ - 1)^2*(x⁴ + 1)^2. Wait, actually, that's [(x⁴ - 1)(x⁴ + 1)]². Let me compute (x⁴ - 1)(x⁴ + 1) first. That would be x⁸ - 1. Therefore, [(x⁴ - 1)(x⁴ + 1)]² = (x⁸ - 1)^2. So the entire integrand simplifies to (x⁸ - 1)^2.

Wait, let me check that again. Original integrand: (x-1)^2(x+1)^2(x²+1)^2(x⁴+1)^2. We first combined (x-1)^2(x+1)^2 to (x² -1)^2. Then multiplied by (x² +1)^2 gives (x⁴ -1)^2. Then multiplied by (x⁴ +1)^2 gives (x⁸ -1)^2. Yes, that's correct. So the integrand simplifies to (x⁸ -1)^2. That's a much simpler expression. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x⁸ -1)² dx.

Now, expanding (x⁸ -1)². Let's do that. (x⁸ -1)^2 = x¹⁶ - 2x⁸ + 1. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x¹⁶ - 2x⁸ + 1) dx. That's much easier to integrate term by term.

Integrate each term separately:

∫x¹⁶ dx from 0 to 1: The integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). So for x¹⁶, it's x¹⁷ /17. Evaluated from 0 to 1: (1¹⁷)/17 - 0 = 1/17.

Next term: -2∫x⁸ dx from 0 to 1. The integral of x⁸ is x⁹/9. Multiply by -2: -2*(x⁹/9) evaluated from 0 to 1. So that's -2*(1/9 - 0) = -2/9.

Last term: ∫1 dx from 0 to 1. That's just x evaluated from 0 to 1, which is 1 - 0 = 1.

Adding all three terms together: (1/17) - (2/9) + 1.

Let me compute that. First, convert to a common denominator. The denominators are 17, 9, and 1. The least common multiple of 17, 9, and 1 is 153.

So:

1/17 = 9/153

-2/9 = -34/153

1 = 153/153

Adding them: 9/153 -34/153 +153/153 = (9 -34 +153)/153 = (128)/153.

Wait, 9 -34 is -25, then -25 +153 is 128. So 128/153.

Wait, 128 and 153. Let me check if they can be simplified. 128 is 2^7. 153 is 9*17, which is 3^2*17. No common factors, so 128/153 is the simplified fraction.

So the exact value of the integral is 128/153.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. 128 divided by 153. Let me compute that.

153 goes into 128 zero times. 153 goes into 1280 eight times (8*153=1224). 1280 -1224=56. Bring down a 0: 560. 153*3=459. 560-459=101. Bring down 0: 1010. 153*6=918. 1010-918=92. Bring down 0: 920. 153*6=918. 920-918=2. Bring down 0: 20. 153*0=0. So next digit is 0. Bring down 0: 200. 153*1=153. 200-153=47. Bring down 0: 470. 153*3=459. 470-459=11. Bring down 0: 110. 153*0=0. So next digit 0. Bring down 0: 1100. 153*7=1071. 1100-1071=29. Bring down 0: 290. 153*1=153. 290-153=137. Bring down 0: 1370. 153*8=1224. 1370-1224=146. Bring down 0: 1460. 153*9=1377. 1460-1377=83. Hmm, this is getting tedious. Let me use a calculator.

Alternatively, 128 ÷ 153. Let me compute this as a decimal. 128 divided by 153. Let's see:

153 × 0.8 = 122.4

128 - 122.4 = 5.6. Wait, no. Wait, 0.0 divided by 153. Wait, perhaps better to compute 128/153.

Using a calculator: 128 ÷ 153. Let's compute:

153 × 0.8 = 122.4

128 - 122.4 = 5.6

Bring down a decimal: 5.6 becomes 56.0. 153 × 0.03 = 4.59

56.0 - 45.9 = 153 ×0.03=4.59, but 0.03*153=4.59. So 56.0 -4.59=51.41

Wait, maybe this is not the right approach. Alternatively, use long division.

128 divided by 153:

0.

153 | 128.000000...

153 doesn't go into 128, so 0.

153 into 1280: 8 times (8*153=1224). Subtract: 1280-1224=56. Bring down 0: 560.

153 into 560: 3 times (3*153=459). Subtract: 560-459=101. Bring down 0: 1010.

153 into 1010: 6 times (6*153=918). Subtract: 1010-918=92. Bring down 0: 920.

153 into 920: 6 times (6*153=918). Subtract: 920-918=2. Bring down 0: 20.

153 into 20: 0 times. Bring down 0: 200.

153 into 200: 1 time (153). Subtract: 200-153=47. Bring down 0: 470.

153 into 470: 3 times (3*153=459). Subtract: 470-459=11. Bring down 0: 110.

153 into 110: 0 times. Bring down 0: 1100.

153 into 1100: 7 times (7*153=1071). Subtract: 1100-1071=29. Bring down 0: 290.

153 into 290: 1 time (153). Subtract: 290-153=137. Bring down 0: 1370.

153 into 1370: 8 times (8*153=1224). Subtract: 1370-1224=146. Bring down 0: 1460.

153 into 1460: 9 times (9*153=1377). Subtract: 1460-1377=83. Bring down 0: 830.

153 into 830: 5 times (5*153=765). Subtract: 830-765=65. Bring down 0: 650.

153 into 650: 4 times (4*153=612). Subtract: 650-612=38. Bring down 0: 380.

153 into 380: 2 times (2*153=306). Subtract: 380-306=74. Bring down 0: 740.

153 into 740: 4 times (4*153=612). Subtract: 740-612=128. Now we see a repeating decimal because we're back to 128.

So the decimal expansion is 0.83660130718954248366013071895424... So the decimal repeats every 16 digits or so. But since we need to round to 10 decimal places, let's look at the first 11 decimal digits after the decimal point:

0.83660130718...

So up to the 10th decimal: 0.8366013071 (the 11th digit is 8, which is 5 or above, so we round up the 10th digit from 1 to 2). Wait, let's check:

Wait, the decimal expansion after 0. is:

From the long division steps:

After 0., the digits are:

8 (from 8*153=1224, remainder 56)

3 (3*153=459, remainder 101)

6 (6*153=918, remainder 92)

6 (6*153=918, remainder 2)

0 (0*153=0, remainder 20)

1 (1*153=153, remainder 47)

3 (3*153=459, remainder 11)

0 (0*153=0, remainder 110)

7 (7*153=1071, remainder 29)

1 (1*153=153, remainder 137)

8 (8*153=1224, remainder 146)

9 (9*153=1377, remainder 83)

5 (5*153=765, remainder 65)

4 (4*153=612, remainder 38)

2 (2*153=306, remainder 74)

4 (4*153=612, remainder 128)

Then it repeats.

So the decimal is 0.83660130718954248366013071895424...

So up to 10 decimal places, let's list the digits:

Position: 1:8, 2:3, 3:6, 4:6, 5:0, 6:1, 7:3, 8:0, 9:7, 10:1, 11:8...

Wait, the first 10 decimal digits are 8,3,6,6,0,1,3,0,7,1. Then the 11th digit is 8, which is greater than 5, so we round up the 10th digit (1) to 2. So the rounded value would be 0.8366013072.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's write out the decimal up to 11 digits:

0.83660130718...

So the 10th decimal place is the 1, followed by an 8. So 0.83660130718 rounds to 0.8366013072 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decimal positions. Let me count:

0.8 (1) 3 (2) 6 (3) 6 (4) 0 (5) 1 (6) 3 (7) 0 (8) 7 (9) 1 (10) 8 (11). So the 10th decimal is 1, and the next digit is 8, which is ≥5, so we add 1 to the 10th decimal. So 1 becomes 2. Therefore, the rounded value is 0.8366013072.

But let me verify this with a calculator. Let me compute 128 divided by 153 using a calculator.

Using a calculator: 128 ÷ 153.

128 ÷ 153 ≈ 0.8366013071895424...

Yes, so 0.0.8366013071895424... So up to 10 decimal places, it's 0.8366013072.

Therefore, the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8366013072.

So the exact answer is 128/153, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8366013072.
