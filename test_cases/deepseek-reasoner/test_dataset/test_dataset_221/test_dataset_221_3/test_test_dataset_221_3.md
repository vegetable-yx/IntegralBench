Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) multiplied by T₄(√(x(1 - x))) dx. Hmm, T₄ is the fourth Chebyshev polynomial, right? First, I need to recall what the Chebyshev polynomials look like. The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, T_n(y), are defined as T_n(y) = cos(n arccos y). But maybe there's a more straightforward polynomial expression for T₄. Let me check.

The Chebyshev polynomials can also be defined recursively. The first few are T₀(y) = 1, T₁(y) = y, T₂(y) = 2y² - 1, T₃(y) = 4y³ - 3y, T₄(y) = 8y⁴ - 8y² + 1. Yes, that's right. So T₄(y) = 8y⁴ - 8y² + 1. So substituting y with √(x(1 - x)), the integrand becomes x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) times [8(√(x(1 - x)))^4 - 8(√(x(1 - x)))^2 + 1].

Let me simplify that. First, (√(x(1 - x)))^2 is just x(1 - x), and (√(x(1 - x)))^4 is [x(1 - x)]². So substituting back, the integrand becomes:

x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) [8x²(1 - x)² - 8x(1 - x) + 1].

So expanding that, the integral becomes the sum of three integrals:

8 ∫₀¹ x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) x²(1 - x)² dx

-8 ∫₀¹ x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) x(1 - x) dx

+ ∫₀¹ x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) dx

Let me handle each integral separately. The integrals look like Beta functions. Remember that the Beta function B(a, b) = ∫₀¹ t^(a-1)(1 - t)^(b-1) dt = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So maybe each of these can be expressed in terms of Beta functions.

First integral: 8 ∫ x^(-1/2 + 2) (1 - x)^(-1/2 + 2) dx = 8 ∫ x^(3/2) (1 - x)^(3/2) dx. So that's 8 * B(5/2, 5/2). Because Beta(a, b) where a = 3/2 + 1 = 5/2, same for b.

Second integral: -8 ∫ x^(-1/2 +1) (1 - x)^(-1/2 +1) dx = -8 ∫ x^(1/2) (1 - x)^(1/2) dx = -8 * B(3/2, 3/2).

Third integral: ∫ x^(-1/2) (1 - x)^(-1/2) dx = B(1/2, 1/2).

So now, let's compute each Beta function.

First, B(5/2, 5/2) = Γ(5/2)Γ(5/2)/Γ(5). Similarly for the others.

We know that Γ(1/2) = √π, and Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n). Let's compute each Gamma function.

Starting with Γ(5/2). Γ(5/2) = (3/2)(1/2)Γ(1/2) = (3/2)(1/2)√π = (3/4)√π.

Similarly, Γ(3/2) = (1/2)Γ(1/2) = (1/2)√π.

Γ(5) = 4! = 24.

So B(5/2, 5/2) = [ (3/4 √π)(3/4 √π) ] / 24 = (9/16 π) / 24 = 9π/(16*24) = 9π/384 = 3π/128.

Similarly, B(3/2, 3/2) = [Γ(3/2)]^2 / Γ(3) = [( (1/2)√π )^2 ] / 2! = ( (1/4)π ) / 2 = π/8.

And B(1/2, 1/2) = Γ(1/2)^2 / Γ(1) = π / 1 = π.

Putting it all together:

First term: 8 * (3π/128) = 24π/128 = 3π/16.

Second term: -8 * (π/8) = -π.

Third term: π.

So adding them up: 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the calculation.

Wait, 3π/16 - π plus π would be 3π/16. But let's verify each term again.

First integral: 8 * B(5/2,5/2) = 8*(3π/128) = 24π/128 = 3π/16. Correct.

Second integral: -8 * B(3/2,3/2) = -8*(π/8) = -π. Correct.

Third integral: B(1/2,1/2) = π. Correct.

So total integral is 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. Wait, that's 3π/16. But that seems too simple. Let me check again.

Wait, 3π/16 - π + π is indeed 3π/16. Because the -π and +π cancel each other. So the second and third terms cancel each other? Wait, no. Wait, the second term is -8*(π/8) = -π. The third term is +π. So -π + π = 0. Then the total integral is 3π/16. So the answer is 3π/16. Hmm. That seems possible. Let me check if I made a mistake in the Beta function parameters.

Wait, the first integral: 8 ∫ x^(3/2)(1 - x)^(3/2) dx. The exponents are 3/2 each, so Beta(5/2,5/2). Correct. Then Γ(5/2) is (3/2)(1/2)√π = 3/4 √π. So Γ(5/2)^2 is 9/16 π. Then divided by Γ(5) which is 24. So 9π/(16*24) = 9π/384 = 3π/128. Then 8 * 3π/128 = 24π/128 = 3π/16. Correct.

Second integral: -8 ∫ x^(1/2)(1 - x)^(1/2) dx. So Beta(3/2,3/2). Γ(3/2) is (1/2)√π, so squared is π/4. Divided by Γ(3) = 2. So π/4 / 2? Wait, wait. Wait, Γ(3) is 2! = 2. So B(3/2,3/2) = (Γ(3/2)^2)/Γ(3) = ( (1/2 √π)^2 ) / 2 = (π/4)/2 = π/8. Then -8 * π/8 = -π. Correct.

Third integral: B(1/2,1/2) = π. So adding up: 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. So the integral equals 3π/16. That's the exact answer. Then the numerical approximation would be 3π divided by 16. Let's compute that. π is approximately 3.1415926536. So 3*3.1415926536 = 9.4247779608, divided by 16: 9.4247779608 /16 ≈ 0.58904862255. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.5890486226.

Wait, but let me check with a calculator precision. Let me compute 3π/16:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

3π = 9.42477796076938

Divide by 16: 9.42477796076938 /16 ≈ 0.5890486225480863. So rounded to 10 decimal places, 0.5890486225. Wait, the 11th decimal is 4, so it's 0.5890486225. But let me check again. 9.42477796076938 divided by 16:

9.0 /16 = 0.5625

0.42477796076938 /16 = 0.026548622548086

So total is 0.5625 + 0.026548622548086 ≈ 0.589048622548086. So 0.5890486225 when rounded to 10 decimal places. So the numerical answer is approximately 0.5890486225.

But let me confirm once more. Alternatively, use a calculator. 3 * π /16:

3 * 3.141592653589793 = 9.42477796076938

9.42477796076938 /16 = 0.5890486225480863. So yes, 0.5890486225 when rounded to 10 decimals.

So the exact answer is 3π/16, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.5890486225.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the integral steps. Let me check again. The original integral was ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2}(1 - x)^{-1/2} T₄(√(x(1 - x))) dx. Then T₄(y) = 8y^4 -8y^2 +1. Then substituting y = √(x(1 -x)), so T₄ becomes 8(x(1 -x))² -8x(1 -x) +1. Then multiplied by x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2}. So the integrand is x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2} [8x²(1 -x)^2 -8x(1 -x) +1]. Then expanding each term:

First term: 8x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2} x²(1 -x)^2 =8x^{3/2}(1 -x)^{3/2}

Second term: -8x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2} x(1 -x) = -8x^{1/2}(1 -x)^{1/2}

Third term: x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2} *1 = x^{-1/2}(1 -x)^{-1/2}

So integrating each term from 0 to1:

First integral: 8 * B(5/2,5/2) = 8 * [Γ(5/2)^2 / Γ(5)] = 8 * [( (3/4)√π )^2 / 24 ]? Wait, no. Wait, Γ(5/2) is (3/2)(1/2)√π = 3/4 √π. So Γ(5/2)^2 is (9/16)π. Then Γ(5) is 4! =24. So B(5/2,5/2) = (9/16 π)/24 = 9π/(16*24) = 3π/(16*8) = 3π/128. Then 8 * 3π/128 = 24π/128 = 3π/16. Correct.

Second integral: -8 * B(3/2,3/2). Γ(3/2) is (1/2)√π, so squared is π/4. Γ(3) is 2! =2. So B(3/2,3/2) = (π/4)/2 = π/8. Then -8 * π/8 = -π. Correct.

Third integral: B(1/2,1/2) = π. So total integral is 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is 3π/16, and the numerical value is approximately 0.5890486225. Therefore, the final answer should be as specified.
