Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) multiplied by the fourth Chebyshev polynomial T₄ evaluated at sqrt(x(1 - x)). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, T_n(x), are defined for x in the interval [-1, 1]. The argument here is sqrt(x(1 - x)), which for x between 0 and 1 will range from 0 to 0.5, since the maximum of x(1 - x) occurs at x=0.5, giving sqrt(0.25) = 0.5. So the argument of T₄ is within [0, 0.5], which is within the domain of Chebyshev polynomials. That's good, no issues there.

The integral is ∫₀¹ x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) T₄(√[x(1 - x)]) dx. Let me write that out more clearly:

I = ∫₀¹ [x(1 - x)]^(-1/2) T₄(√[x(1 - x)}) dx.

Wait, the integrand is x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) times T₄ of sqrt(x(1 - x)). Let me note that x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) is the same as [x(1 - x)]^(-1/2). So the integrand is [x(1 - x)]^(-1/2) * T₄(√[x(1 - x)}).

Hmm, maybe a substitution would help here. Let me think. Let’s set t = √[x(1 - x)}. Then t² = x(1 - x). But I need to express x in terms of t, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps a trigonometric substitution. Since the integral from 0 to 1 of x^(-1/2)(1 - x)^(-1/2) dx is the Beta function B(1/2, 1/2) = π. But here we have an extra factor of T₄(t), so maybe this integral can be related to some orthogonal polynomial expansion or use orthogonality properties.

Wait, Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal on [-1, 1] with weight function (1 - x²)^(-1/2). But here, the weight is different. Let me check the weight function here: the integrand has [x(1 - x)]^(-1/2) which is similar to the Beta function weight x^{c-1}(1 - x)^{d-1}. Here, c = 1/2 and d = 1/2. So the standard Beta function is B(1/2,1/2) = π. But with the T₄ term, maybe we can expand T₄ in terms of some orthogonal polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the Beta(1/2,1/2) weight. Alternatively, perhaps express T₄(√(x(1 - x))) in terms of a hypergeometric function or use a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution to make the integral look like something involving trigonometric functions. Let me try the standard substitution for Beta integrals: set x = sin²θ. Then when x goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from 0 to π/2. Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's try that substitution.

So substituting x = sin²θ, then 1 - x = cos²θ, and sqrt(x(1 - x)) = sinθ cosθ. Then the integrand becomes:

[x(1 - x)]^(-1/2) = [sin²θ cos²θ]^(-1/2) = 1/(sinθ cosθ).

Then T₄(sinθ cosθ) is T₄( (sin2θ)/2 ), since sinθ cosθ = (sin2θ)/2. So the integrand becomes (1/(sinθ cosθ)) * T₄( (sin2θ)/2 ). Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. So putting it all together:

I = ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(sinθ cosθ)] * T₄( (sin2θ)/2 ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the terms: The [1/(sinθ cosθ)] and 2 sinθ cosθ cancel out except for the 2. So:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} T₄( (sin2θ)/2 ) dθ

Hmm, that's simpler. So now the integral reduces to 2 times the integral from 0 to π/2 of T₄( (sin2θ)/2 ) dθ. Let me make another substitution here. Let’s set φ = 2θ. Then when θ = 0, φ = 0; θ = π/2, φ = π. Then dθ = dφ/2. So:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π} T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) * (dφ/2) = ∫₀^{π} T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) dφ

So now, the integral is ∫₀^{π} T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) dφ. Let me recall that T₄(x) is the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree 4. The definition is Tₙ(x) = cos(n arccos x). So T₄(x) = cos(4 arccos x). But here, the argument is (sinφ)/2. Let me compute T₄( (sinφ)/2 ). Let’s set x = (sinφ)/2. Then T₄(x) = cos(4 arccos x). Hmm, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe express T₄ in terms of powers of x.

Alternatively, use the explicit formula for T₄(x). The Chebyshev polynomials can be written as:

T₀(x) = 1

T₁(x) = x

T₂(x) = 2x² - 1

T₃(x) = 4x³ - 3x

T₄(x) = 8x⁴ - 8x² + 1

Yes, so T₄(x) = 8x⁴ - 8x² + 1. Therefore, substituting x = (sinφ)/2:

T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) = 8*( (sinφ)/2 )⁴ - 8*( (sinφ)/2 )² + 1

Let me compute each term:

First term: 8*(sin⁴φ)/16 = (8/16) sin⁴φ = (1/2) sin⁴φ

Second term: -8*(sin²φ)/4 = -2 sin²φ

Third term: +1

So overall:

T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) = (1/2) sin⁴φ - 2 sin²φ + 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

I = ∫₀^{π} [ (1/2) sin⁴φ - 2 sin²φ + 1 ] dφ

Now, let's split this into three separate integrals:

I = (1/2) ∫₀^{π} sin⁴φ dφ - 2 ∫₀^{π} sin²φ dφ + ∫₀^{π} 1 dφ

Compute each integral separately.

First, ∫₀^{π} 1 dφ = π.

Second, ∫₀^{π} sin²φ dφ. The integral of sin² over 0 to π is (π/2). Because ∫ sin²x dx from 0 to π is (π/2). Let me confirm: sin²x = (1 - cos2x)/2, so integral is (1/2)∫₀^π (1 - cos2x) dx = (1/2)[x - (sin2x)/2] from 0 to π. At π: (1/2)(π - 0) = π/2. At 0: 0. So total is π/2.

Third, ∫₀^{π} sin⁴φ dφ. To compute this, use the power-reduction formula. sin⁴φ = (3/8) - (1/2)cos2φ) + (1/8)cos4φ). Wait, let me recall:

sin⁴x = [3 - 4 cos2x + cos4x]/8. So integrating from 0 to π:

∫ sin⁴x dx = (1/8) ∫ (3 - 4 cos2x + cos4x) dx from 0 to π.

Integrate term by term:

3*(π - 0) = 3π

-4 ∫ cos2x dx from 0 to π: -4*( (sin2x)/2 ) from 0 to π. But sin2π = 0, sin0=0, so this term is 0.

∫ cos4x dx from 0 to π: (sin4x)/4 from 0 to π. Again, sin4π=0, so this term is 0.

Therefore, ∫ sin⁴x dx from 0 to π is (1/8)(3π) = 3π/8.

So putting it all together:

I = (1/2)*(3π/8) - 2*(π/2) + π

Compute each term:

First term: (3π/16)

Second term: -2*(π/2) = -π

Third term: π

So total I = 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check:

Wait, 3π/16 - π + π is 3π/16. But that seems too simple. Let me recheck the calculation:

I = (1/2)*(3π/8) - 2*(π/2) + π

First term: (1/2)*(3π/8) = 3π/16

Second term: -2*(π/2) = -π

Third term: +π

So 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. Yes, the -π and +π cancel each other, leaving 3π/16. So the integral evaluates to 3π/16.

Wait, but let me check again. Because when I split the integral, the coefficients were:

(1/2) * (3π/8) = 3π/16

Then -2*(π/2) = -π

Then +π

So 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. Yes. So the final result is 3π/16.

But let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Let's compute the integral to check.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution steps. Let me retrace.

Original integral: ∫₀¹ x^{-1/2}(1 - x)^{-1/2} T₄(√(x(1 - x))) dx.

We substituted x = sin²θ, leading to dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ, and the integrand becomes [x(1 - x)]^{-1/2} = 1/(sinθ cosθ). Then T₄(√(x(1 - x)) ) = T₄(sinθ cosθ). Then the integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} [1/(sinθ cosθ)] * T₄(sinθ cosθ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ = 2 ∫0^{π/2} T₄(sinθ cosθ) dθ. Then we set φ = 2θ, leading to integral from 0 to π of T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) dφ * (1/2)*2 = ∫0^{π} T₄( (sinφ)/2 ) dφ. Then expanding T₄ as 8x⁴ -8x² +1, substituting x = (sinφ)/2, leading to the integral of (1/2 sin⁴φ - 2 sin²φ +1) over 0 to π. Then integrating term by term gives 3π/16.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the expansion of T₄. Let me check T₄(x) = 8x⁴ -8x² +1. Yes, for Chebyshev polynomials, T₀=1, T₁=x, T₂=2x²-1, T₃=4x³-3x, T₄=8x⁴-8x²+1. So that's correct.

Then substituting x = (sinφ)/2, so T₄(x) = 8*(sinφ/2)^4 -8*(sinφ/2)^2 +1. Let's compute each term:

8*(sin⁴φ)/16 = (8/16) sin⁴φ = 0.5 sin⁴φ

-8*(sin²φ)/4 = -2 sin²φ

+1. So yes, that's correct. So the integrand becomes 0.5 sin⁴φ -2 sin²φ +1. Then integrating each term over 0 to π.

Integral of 0.5 sin⁴φ dφ: 0.5*(3π/8) = 3π/16

Integral of -2 sin²φ dφ: -2*(π/2) = -π

Integral of 1 dφ: π

So total: 3π/16 - π + π = 3π/16. So that's correct.

Therefore, the exact value is 3π/16. Let me compute the numerical value. π is approximately 3.1415926536. So 3π/16 ≈ 3*3.1415926536 /16 ≈ 9.4247779608 /16 ≈ 0.58904862255. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's approximately 0.5890486226.

Wait, let me compute it more precisely:

3 * π ≈ 3 * 3.141592653589793 = 9.42477796076938

Divide by 16: 9.42477796076938 /16 ≈ 0.5890486225480863

So rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.5890486225

Wait, but let me check with more precise calculation:

π ≈ 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

3π ≈ 9.4247779607693797153879301498385

Divide by 16: 9.4247779607693797153879301498385 /16 ≈ 0.58904862254808623221174563436491

So up to 10 decimal places: 0.5890486225

But let me check the 11th decimal digit: 0.58904862254... So 0.5890486225 (rounded to 10 decimal places).

Therefore, the exact answer is 3π/16, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.5890486225.

So the final answer should be {"answer": "\\frac{3\\pi}{16}", "numerical_answer": 0.5890486225}
