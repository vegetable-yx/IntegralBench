Okay, let's tackle this integral: the definite integral from 0 to 1 of the cube root of x times the floor of 1 over the cube root of x, dx. So, written out, it's ∫₀¹ ∛x · floor(1/∛x) dx. Hmm, floor functions can be tricky because they introduce discontinuities. I need to figure out where the floor function changes its value and break the integral into intervals accordingly.

First, let's understand the floor function part: floor(1/∛x). The cube root of x, ∛x, is a function that increases from 0 to 1 as x goes from 0 to 1. Therefore, 1/∛x decreases from infinity to 1 as x increases from 0 to 1. The floor of that would be the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/∛x. So, as x increases, 1/∛x decreases, and the floor function will step down each time 1/∛x crosses an integer.

Let me denote y = ∛x. Then x = y³, and dx = 3y² dy. But maybe substitution complicates things. Alternatively, let's think in terms of x. Let's set t = 1/∛x, so t = x^{-1/3}, which implies x = t^{-3}. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 1. But maybe this substitution can help. Let's see.

But perhaps it's better to find the points where floor(1/∛x) changes its integer value. Let's say floor(1) = n, where n is a positive integer. So, floor(1/∛x) = n when n ≤ 1/∛x < n+1. Solving for x, this inequality is equivalent to 1/(n+1)³ < x ≤ 1/n³. Because if we take reciprocals (and reverse inequalities) of the positive terms: 1/(n+1)³ < x ≤ 1/n³. So, for each integer n ≥ 1, the floor function is equal to n on the interval (1/(n+1)³, 1/n³]. However, when x is exactly 1/n³, 1/∛x is exactly n, so the floor is n. Similarly, as x approaches 1/(n+1)³ from the right, 1/∛x approaches n+1, so the floor is n+1. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.

Wait, let's take n such that floor(1/∛x) = n. Then, n ≤ 1/∛x < n+1. Let's invert all parts. Since 1/∛x is positive, inverting reverses inequalities. So, 1/(n+1) < ∛x ≤ 1/n. Then, cubing all parts, we get [1/(n+1)]³ < x ≤ (1/n)³. So, the interval for x where floor(1/∛x) = n is (1/(n+1)³, 1/n³]. Therefore, the integral can be broken into a sum over n from 1 to infinity of the integral from 1/(n+1)³ to 1/n³ of ∛x * n dx. But since x ranges from 0 to 1, and for x in (0,1], 1/∛x is ≥1, so n starts at 1 and goes to infinity. However, in practice, for x in (0,1], 1/∛x is ≥1, so the floor function starts at n=1 when x is near 0, and as x approaches 1, 1/∛x approaches 1, so floor is 1. Wait, but when x is in (1/(n+1)³, 1/n³], floor(1/∛x) is n. So, the intervals are from x=1/(n+1)³ to x=1/n³, and for each such interval, the integrand is ∛x * n. Therefore, the integral becomes the sum over n=1 to infinity of n * ∫_{1/(n+1)³}^{1/n³} ∛x dx.

But since x is between 0 and 1, and the upper limit for n=1 is 1/1³=1, and the lower limit for n=1 is 1/(2)³=1/8. Then for n=2, the interval is 1/27 to 1/8, etc. Wait, but as n increases, 1/(n+1)³ becomes smaller. Wait, no. For n=1, the interval is (1/8, 1]. For n=2, it's (1/27, 1/8]. For n=3, (1/64, 1/27], etc. So, the intervals are getting smaller as n increases, approaching zero. So, the integral is the sum from n=1 to infinity of n times the integral from 1/(n+1)^3 to 1/n^3 of x^{1/3} dx.

So, let's compute each integral. The integral of x^{1/3} dx is (3/4) x^{4/3} + C. Therefore, the integral from a to b is (3/4)(b^{4/3} - a^{4/3}).

Therefore, each term in the sum is n * (3/4)[ (1/n^3)^{4/3} - (1/(n+1)^3)^{4/3} ].

Simplify exponents:

(1/n^3)^{4/3} = 1/n^{4}, and similarly (1/(n+1)^3)^{4/3} = 1/(n+1)^4.

Therefore, each term is n * (3/4)(1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4) = (3/4)(1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4). Wait, wait, let's check:

Wait, n multiplied by (1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4) is n*(1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4) = 1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4. Hmm, but maybe there's a better way to write this. Let's see:

Alternatively, factor out the 3/4 and the n:

Each term is (3/4) * n [1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4] = (3/4)[1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4]. Hmm, but perhaps this can be telescoped? Let's see.

But maybe we can write the sum as (3/4) sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4]. Let's see if this telescopes. Let's check the terms:

For n=1: 1/1^3 - 1/(2)^4 *1 = 1 - 1/16

For n=2: 1/8 - 2/(3)^4 = 1/8 - 2/81

For n=3: 1/27 - 3/(4)^4 = 1/27 - 3/256

But does this telescope? Let's see if the terms can be rearranged. Let's consider the sum as sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^3 - sum_{n=1}^\infty n/(n+1)^4.

The first sum is the Riemann zeta function at 3, ζ(3), which is approximately 1.2020569... but we need an exact value. However, ζ(3) is known to be irrational, but I don't think it has a closed-form expression. Wait, but maybe the second sum can be related to another sum.

Let's look at the second sum: sum_{n=1}^\infty n/(n+1)^4. Let's make a substitution m = n+1. Then when n=1, m=2, so sum becomes sum_{m=2}^\infty (m-1)/m^4 = sum_{m=2}^\infty (m/m^4 - 1/m^4) = sum_{m=2}^\infty (1/m^3 - 1/m^4) = [sum_{m=1}^\infty 1/m^3 - 1/m^4] - [1/1^3 - 1/1^4] = [ζ(3) - ζ(4)] - (1 - 1) = ζ(3) - ζ(4).

Wait, let's verify:

Original second sum: sum_{n=1}^\infty n/(n+1)^4. Let m = n+1, so n = m-1. Then sum becomes sum_{m=2}^\infty (m-1)/m^4 = sum_{m=2}^\infty (m/m^4 - 1/m^4) = sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/m^3 - sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/m^4. Then, sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/m^3 = ζ(3) - 1/1^3 = ζ(3) -1. Similarly, sum_{m=2}^\infty 1/m^4 = ζ(4) -1. Therefore, the second sum is (ζ(3) -1) - (ζ(4) -1) = ζ(3) - ζ(4).

Therefore, the original expression is (3/4)[ sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^3 - (ζ(3) - ζ(4)) ] = (3/4)[ ζ(3) - ζ(3) + ζ(4) ] = (3/4) ζ(4).

But ζ(4) is known to be π^4/90. Therefore, the integral becomes (3/4) * (π^4/90) = (3/4)*(π^4/90) = π^4/(120). Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let's recap:

Original integral is sum_{n=1}^\infty [ (3/4)(1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4) ]

Then, we split the sum into two parts:

(3/4)[ sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^3 - sum_{n=1}^\infty n/(n+1)^4 ]

Then, as we found, the second sum is ζ(3) - ζ(4). Therefore, the total becomes:

(3/4)[ ζ(3) - (ζ(3) - ζ(4)) ] = (3/4) ζ(4)

Yes, that's correct. So, the integral simplifies to (3/4) ζ(4). Since ζ(4) = π^4/90, then:

Integral = (3/4)*(π^4/90) = (3π^4)/(4*90) = π^4/(120). So, the exact answer is π⁴/120.

Wait, but let me verify this with a different approach to be sure.

Alternatively, let's compute the sum directly. Let's write out the terms of the sum:

sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4] = sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^3 - sum_{n=1}^\infty n/(n+1)^4.

We already saw that the second sum is ζ(3) - ζ(4). Therefore, the first sum is ζ(3). So, ζ(3) - (ζ(3) - ζ(4)) = ζ(4). Therefore, the integral is (3/4) ζ(4). So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the exact value is (3/4) * ζ(4) = (3/4)*(π^4/90) = π^4/(120). So, the exact answer is π⁴⁄₁₂₀.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. π⁴ is approximately (9.8696044)^2 ≈ 97.40909103. Then, 97.40909103 divided by 120 is approximately 0.81174242525. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8117424253.

Wait, let me compute π^4 more accurately. π ≈ 3.141592653589793. So, π² ≈ 9.869604401089358. Then, π^4 = (π²)^2 ≈ (9.869604401089358)^2. Let's compute that:

9.869604401089358 * 9.869604401089358

First, 9 * 9 = 81

9 * 0.869604401089358 ≈ 7.826439609804222

0.869604401089358 * 9 ≈ 7.826439609804222

0.869604401089358 * 0.869604401089358 ≈ Let's compute that:

0.8^2 = 0.64

0.069604401089358^2 ≈ approx (0.07)^2 = 0.0049, but more accurately:

0.069604401089358 ≈ 0.069604401089358

Square: (0.069604401089358)^2 ≈ 0.004844. So, total cross terms:

2*9*0.8696... ≈ 2*9*0.869604401089358 ≈ 15.652879219608444

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 9.869604401089358 * 9.869604401089358:

Let me use a calculator approach:

Multiply 9.869604401089358 by itself:

First, 9 * 9 = 81

9 * 0.869604401089358 = 7.826439609804222

0.869604401089358 * 9 = 7.826439609804222

0.869604401089358 * 0.869604401089358 ≈ Let's compute 0.8696^2:

0.8696 * 0.8696 = (0.8 + 0.0696)^2 = 0.8² + 2*0.8*0.0696 + 0.0696² = 0.64 + 0.11136 + 0.00484416 = 0.64 + 0.11136 = 0.75136 + 0.00484416 ≈ 0.75620416. So, approximately 0.75620416.

Adding all parts:

81 + 7.826439609804222 + 7.826439609804222 + 0.75620416 ≈

81 + 15.652879219608444 = 96.65287921960844 + 0.75620416 ≈ 97.40908337960844.

So, π^4 ≈ 97.40908337960844.

Then, π^4 / 120 ≈ 97.40908337960844 / 120 ≈ 0.811742361496737.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8117423615.

Wait, but let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, use known value of ζ(4):

ζ(4) = π^4 / 90 ≈ 1.082323233711138. Then, 3/4 of that is 0.8117424253. So, 3/4 * 1.082323233711138 ≈ 0.8117424253. So, the numerical value is approximately 0.8117424253. But when I calculated π^4 / 120, I got 0.8117423615. There's a slight difference due to approximation errors in the manual calculation. But since ζ(4) is exactly π^4/90, then 3/4 * π^4/90 = π^4/120. So, the exact value is π^4/120, and the approximate value is approximately 0.8117424253.

Therefore, the exact answer is π⁴⁄₁₂₀, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8117424253.

Let me confirm once more the steps:

1. The integral is split into intervals where floor(1/∛x) is constant n, which corresponds to x in (1/(n+1)^3, 1/n^3].

2. For each interval, the integrand is ∛x * n.

3. The integral over each interval is n * ∫_{1/(n+1)^3}^{1/n^3} x^{1/3} dx = n * [ (3/4)x^{4/3} ]_{1/(n+1)^3}^{1/n^3} = (3/4) n [ (1/n^4) - (1/(n+1)^4) ].

4. Summing over all n from 1 to ∞ gives (3/4) [ sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^3 - sum_{n=1}^∞ n/(n+1)^4 ].

5. The second sum is transformed by substituting m = n+1, leading to sum_{m=2}^∞ (m-1)/m^4 = ζ(3) - ζ(4).

6. Therefore, the total sum becomes (3/4)[ ζ(3) - (ζ(3) - ζ(4)) ] = (3/4) ζ(4).

7. Since ζ(4) = π^4/90, the integral is (3/4)(π^4/90) = π^4/120.

All steps check out, so the exact answer is π⁴⁄₁₂₀, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8117424253.
