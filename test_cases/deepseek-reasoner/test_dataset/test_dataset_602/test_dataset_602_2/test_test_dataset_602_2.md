Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of the cube root of x multiplied by the floor of 1 over the cube root of x. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, the integrand is ∛x times the floor of 1/∛x. The floor function here is going to create different intervals where the value is constant, right? Because the floor function jumps at points where 1/∛x is an integer. So I should probably find those points where 1/∛x is an integer and split the integral into intervals between those points.

Let me think. Let’s denote y = 1/∛x. Then, solving for x, we get x = 1/y³. So when y is an integer, say n, then x = 1/n³. So the points where the floor function changes its value are at x = 1/n³ for positive integers n. But since x is going from 0 to 1, n will start from 1 upwards. Wait, but as x approaches 0, 1/∛x becomes very large, so the floor function will take on values n = 1, 2, 3, etc., but each subsequent interval is between x = 1/(n+1)³ and x = 1/n³. Wait, actually, when x decreases, 1/∛x increases. So the intervals should be from x = 1/(n+1)³ to x = 1/n³, and in each interval, the floor of 1/∛x is n. Let me check that.

Suppose n is an integer. If x is between 1/(n+1)³ and 1/n³, then ∛x is between 1/(n+1) and 1/n. Therefore, 1/∛x is between n and n+1. So the floor of that would be n. So yes, on the interval [1/(n+1)³, 1/n³), the floor function is n. Therefore, the integral can be broken into a sum over n from 1 to infinity of n times the integral of ∛x from 1/(n+1)³ to 1/n³. But wait, since x is going from 0 to 1, the lower limit for n=1 would be x=1/2³=1/8 to x=1/1³=1. Then for n=2, it's from 1/3³=1/27 to 1/8, and so on. Wait, actually, the intervals are [1/(n+1)³, 1/n³) for n starting at 1, 2, 3,... But when n approaches infinity, 1/(n+1)³ approaches 0. So the integral from 0 to 1 can be written as the sum from n=1 to infinity of the integral from 1/(n+1)³ to 1/n³ of ∛x * n dx.

But wait, when n=1, the interval is [1/8, 1], right? Because 1/(1+1)³=1/8 and 1/1³=1. Then for n=2, it's [1/27, 1/8), and so on. So the integral from 0 to 1 is the sum from n=1 to infinity of the integral from 1/(n+1)³ to 1/n³ of n * x^(1/3) dx. That makes sense.

So, let's write that as:

Integral = Σ (from n=1 to ∞) [ n * ∫_{1/(n+1)³}^{1/n³} x^(1/3) dx ]

Now, compute each integral. The integral of x^(1/3) dx is (3/4) x^(4/3) + C. So each term in the sum is n * (3/4) [ (1/n³)^(4/3) - (1/(n+1)³)^(4/3) ]

Simplify the exponents. (1/n³)^(4/3) = 1/n^4, because (n³)^(4/3) = n^(4). Similarly, (1/(n+1)³)^(4/3) = 1/(n+1)^4. So each term becomes n * (3/4) [1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4 ] )

So the integral becomes (3/4) Σ (from n=1 to ∞) [ n (1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4) ]

Simplify the expression inside the sum: n*(1/n^4 - 1/(n+1)^4) = 1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4

So the integral is (3/4) times the sum from n=1 to infinity of [1/n³ - n/(n+1)^4]

Now, let's split the sum into two separate sums:

(3/4) [ Σ (1/n³) - Σ (n/(n+1)^4) ]

Let’s consider the second sum: Σ (n/(n+1)^4) from n=1 to ∞. Let's make a substitution m = n+1. Then when n=1, m=2, and as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity. So the sum becomes Σ ( (m-1)/m^4 ) from m=2 to ∞. Which is the same as Σ ( (m-1)/m^4 ) from m=2 to ∞. But this can be written as Σ (1/m³ - 1/m^4 ) from m=2 to ∞.

Therefore, the second sum is Σ (1/m³ - 1/m^4 ) from m=2 to ∞. So the original expression becomes:

(3/4) [ Σ (1/n³ from n=1 to ∞) - ( Σ (1/m³ - 1/m^4 ) from m=2 to ∞ ) ]

Let’s substitute back into the same variable for the sum:

= (3/4) [ Σ (1/n³) - Σ (1/n³ - 1/n^4 ) from n=2 to ∞ ]

Now, let's split the first sum into the n=1 term and the rest:

Σ (1/n³ from n=1 to ∞) = 1 + Σ (1/n³ from n=2 to ∞)

So substituting back:

= (3/4) [ 1 + Σ (1/n³ from n=2 to ∞) - Σ (1/n³ - 1/n^4 from n=2 to ∞) ]

Now, subtract the two sums:

Σ (1/n³ from n=2 to ∞) - Σ (1/n³ - 1/n^4 from n=2 to ∞) = Σ [1/n³ - (1/n³ - 1/n^4)] from n=2 to ∞) = Σ (1/n^4 from n=2 to ∞)

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(3/4) [ 1 + Σ (1/n^4 from n=2 to ∞) ]

But Σ (1/n^4 from n=1 to ∞) is the Riemann zeta function ζ(4), so Σ (1/n^4 from n=2 to ∞) = ζ(4) - 1

Therefore, the integral is (3/4) [1 + ζ(4) - 1] = (3/4) ζ(4)

But ζ(4) is known to be π^4/90. So ζ(4) = π^4/90. Therefore, the integral is (3/4)*(π^4/90) = (3π^4)/(4*90) = π^4/(120)

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3/4 times 90 is 3*90=270, 270/4=67.5, but 3/4 * π^4/90 = (3π^4)/(4*90) = π^4/(120). Yes, because 3/90 is 1/30, so 1/30 divided by 4 is 1/120. So the exact value is π^4/120.

But wait, let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the sums again.

Original integral becomes (3/4)[ Σ (1/n³ - n/(n+1)^4 ) ]

Then, split into two sums: (3/4)[ Σ1/n³ - Σn/(n+1)^4 ]

Then, for the second sum, substitute m = n+1, so n/(n+1)^4 = (m-1)/m^4, and sum from m=2 to ∞. Then, split (m-1)/m^4 into 1/m³ - 1/m^4. So the second sum becomes Σ(1/m³ -1/m^4) from m=2 to ∞.

So, the original expression is (3/4)[ Σ1/n³ (from n=1 to ∞) - Σ(1/m³ -1/m^4) (from m=2 to ∞) ]

Which is (3/4)[ Σ1/n³ (from n=1 to ∞) - Σ1/m³ (from m=2 to ∞) + Σ1/m^4 (from m=2 to ∞) ]

Then, Σ1/n³ from n=1 to ∞ minus Σ1/m³ from m=2 to ∞ is just 1/1³ = 1. Then, plus Σ1/m^4 from m=2 to ∞. So total is 1 + Σ1/m^4 from m=2 to ∞. But Σ1/m^4 from m=2 to ∞ is ζ(4) - 1. So total expression is 1 + ζ(4) -1 = ζ(4). Therefore, the integral is (3/4)ζ(4). Then ζ(4) is π^4/90, so (3/4)*(π^4/90) = π^4/(120). Yes, that's correct.

So the exact value is π^4/120. Then, the numerical approximation. Let's compute π^4. π is approximately 3.1415926536. So π^4 is (π²)^2. π² is about 9.8696044, so squared is approximately 97.40909103. Then, divided by 120: 97.40909103 / 120 ≈ 0.811742425. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's approximately 0.8117424253. Let me check with a calculator.

Alternatively, using more precise value of π: 3.141592653589793. π^4: 3.141592653589793^4. Let's compute step by step. First, square π: 3.141592653589793^2 ≈ 9.869604401089358. Then square that: 9.869604401089358^2. Let's compute 9.8696044^2: 9.8696044 * 9.8696044. Let's compute 9 * 9 = 81, 9 * 0.8696044 ≈ 7.8264396, 0.8696044 * 9 ≈ 7.8264396, and 0.8696044^2 ≈ 0.756. So adding up: 81 + 7.8264396 +7.8264396 +0.756 ≈ 97.4088792. But more accurately, using a calculator, π^4 ≈ 97.40909103400244. Then, divided by 120: 97.40909103400244 / 120 ≈ 0.8117424252833537. So approximately 0.8117424253 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the exact answer is π^4/120, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8117424253.

Wait, but let me check if there's a mistake in the steps. Because when dealing with the floor function, sometimes intervals can be tricky. Let me verify with a small example. For example, when n=1, the interval is from x=1/(1+1)^3=1/8 to x=1/1^3=1. Then, the integral over [1/8,1] of ∛x *1 dx. Then for n=2, the interval is [1/27,1/8), integral of ∛x *2 dx, etc. So the sum from n=1 to infinity of n * integral from 1/(n+1)^3 to 1/n^3 of x^(1/3) dx. Then, when we compute each integral, it's n*(3/4)[x^(4/3)] from 1/(n+1)^3 to 1/n^3. Then x^(4/3) evaluated at 1/n^3 is (1/n^3)^(4/3)=1/n^4. Similarly at 1/(n+1)^3 is 1/(n+1)^4. So each term is n*(3/4)(1/n^4 -1/(n+1)^4) = (3/4)(1/n^3 - n/(n+1)^4). Then summing over n=1 to infinity. Then, when we split the sum into two parts, and then telescope, we end up with (3/4)ζ(4). So the steps seem correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is π^4/120, and the numerical value is approximately 0.8117424253.
