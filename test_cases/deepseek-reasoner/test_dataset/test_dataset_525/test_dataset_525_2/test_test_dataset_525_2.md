Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of arcsin(x)/x³ from 1/√2 to 1. Hmm, let's start by thinking about integration techniques. The integrand is arcsin(x) divided by x cubed. That looks a bit tricky. Maybe integration by parts would work here since we have a product of functions: arcsin(x) and 1/x³. 

Integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me choose u and dv. Let’s set u = arcsin(x) because its derivative is manageable, and dv = 1/x³ dx. Then du would be 1/√(1 - x²) dx, and integrating dv gives v. Let me check: the integral of 1/x³ is ∫x^(-3) dx = (-1/(2x²)) + C. So v = -1/(2x²).

Applying integration by parts: uv evaluated from 1/√2 to 1 minus the integral of v du. So that's [-arcsin(x)/(2x²)] from 1/√2 to 1 minus ∫(-1/(2x²)) * (1/√(1 - x²)) dx. Let's simplify that. The first term becomes [-arcsin(1)/(2*1²) + arcsin(1/√2)/(2*(1/√2)²)]. Then the integral becomes + (1/2) ∫1/(x²√(1 - x²)) dx.

Calculating the first part: arcsin(1) is π/2, so that term is -π/(4). For the lower limit, arcsin(1/√2) is π/4, and (1/√2)² is 1/2, so denominator is 2*(1/2) = 1. So that term is (π/4)/1 = π/4. So the entire evaluated part is (-π/4 + π/4) which is 0. Wait, that cancels out? Interesting. So the whole integral reduces to (1/2) ∫ from 1/√2 to 1 of 1/(x²√(1 - x²)) dx.

Now, need to compute that remaining integral: ∫1/(x²√(1 - x²)) dx. Let me think about substitution. Let’s try substitution t = sqrt(1 - x²). Let’s set t = √(1 - x²), so t² = 1 - x². Then, dt/dx = (-x)/√(1 - x²). Hmm, but maybe another substitution. Alternatively, let’s try x = sinθ. If x = sinθ, then dx = cosθ dθ, and √(1 - x²) = cosθ. Let's see:

When x = 1/√2, θ = arcsin(1/√2) = π/4. When x = 1, θ = π/2. So substituting into the integral:

∫1/(x²√(1 - x²)) dx becomes ∫ [1/(sin²θ * cosθ)] * cosθ dθ. The cosθ in the denominator and the dx = cosθ dθ would cancel out. So that simplifies to ∫1/sin²θ dθ from π/4 to π/2. The integral of 1/sin²θ is -cotθ + C. So evaluating from π/4 to π/2: [-cot(π/2) + cot(π/4)]. Cot(π/2) is 0, and cot(π/4) is 1. So the integral becomes [0 + 1] = 1. Therefore, the remaining integral is 1. So multiplying by 1/2, the entire original integral is (1/2)*1 = 1/2. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again.

Wait, the substitution steps: x = sinθ, so dx = cosθ dθ. Then, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(sin²θ * cosθ)] * cosθ dθ. The cosθ in the denominator cancels with the cosθ in the numerator from dx. So we have ∫1/sin²θ dθ, which is ∫csc²θ dθ = -cotθ + C. Evaluated from π/4 to π/2: -cot(π/2) + cot(π/4) = -0 + 1 = 1. So yes, the integral is 1. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives 1/2. But wait, the original integral after integration by parts was (1/2) times that integral. So the total integral is 1/2. But let me check the limits again.

Wait, the original integral was from 1/√2 to 1. After substitution, θ goes from π/4 to π/2, which is correct. So the integral of csc²θ from π/4 to π/2 is indeed 1. So the integral becomes 1/2. Therefore, the entire definite integral is 1/2. But wait, the first part after integration by parts was zero? Let me confirm that again.

Original integration by parts: [-arcsin(x)/(2x²)] from 1/√2 to 1. At x=1: arcsin(1) = π/2, so term is -π/(2*1²*2) = -π/4. At x=1/√2: arcsin(1/√2) is π/4, and denominator is 2*(1/√2)^2 = 2*(1/2) = 1. So term is -π/4 / (2*(1/2))? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the expression is [ -arcsin(x)/(2x²) ] evaluated at upper limit minus lower limit. So upper limit x=1: -π/2 / (2*1²) = -π/4. Lower limit x=1/√2: - (π/4) / (2*(1/√2)^2). Let's compute (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, so denominator is 2*(1/2) = 1. So the lower limit term is -π/4 / 1 = -π/4. Therefore, the evaluated part is (-π/4) - (-π/4) = 0. So yes, that part cancels out, leaving the integral as (1/2)*1 = 1/2. So the exact answer is 1/2. But wait, that seems surprisingly simple. Let me check with a numerical approximation to see if that's correct.

Wait, let's compute the integral numerically. Let's take x=1, the integrand is arcsin(1)/1³ = π/2 ≈ 1.5708. At x=1/√2 ≈0.7071, arcsin(0.7071) is π/4 ≈0.7854, divided by (0.7071)^3 ≈0.3535, so the integrand is approximately 0.7854 / 0.3535 ≈2.2214. So the function is decreasing from ~2.22 to ~1.57 over the interval. The integral is the area under the curve. If the exact answer is 1/2 = 0.5, but the average value of the function is around 1.8, over an interval of (1 - 1/√2) ≈0.2929. So 1.8 * 0.2929 ≈0.527, which is close to 0.5. Hmm, but maybe my estimation is rough. Let me compute the numerical approximation more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the integration steps. Let me check again. The integral after substitution was ∫1/sin²θ dθ from π/4 to π/2. The antiderivative is -cotθ. At π/2, cotθ is 0, at π/4, cotθ is 1. So the integral is [-0 - (-1)] = 1. So that's correct. Then multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/2. So the exact answer is 1/2. But when I think about the numerical approximation, 0.5. Let me check with a calculator. Let me compute the integral from 1/√2 to 1 of arcsin(x)/x³ dx. Let's say using numerical integration. Let me approximate it.

Alternatively, use substitution. Let me take x = sinθ, then dx = cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫θ / sin³θ * cosθ dθ from θ=π/4 to π/2. Wait, but that's different from before. Wait, original integrand is arcsin(x)/x³. If x = sinθ, then arcsin(x) = θ, and x³ = sin³θ. So the integrand becomes θ / sin³θ * cosθ dθ. So ∫θ cosθ / sin³θ dθ. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Wait, but earlier steps via integration by parts led to a simpler integral. Maybe that's the correct path.

Wait, but in the integration by parts approach, we split it into two parts. The first part evaluated to zero, and the remaining integral was 1/2. So the exact answer is 1/2. Let me check with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically. Let's use a calculator. For example, at x=1, the integrand is π/2 ≈1.5708. At x=0.7071, it's arcsin(0.7071)/(0.7071)^3 ≈ (π/4)/ (0.3535) ≈0.7854/0.3535≈2.2214. The interval is from 0.7071 to 1. Let's approximate using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. Let's take two intervals: x=0.7071, 0.8536, 1. The midpoints. Let's compute the function at x=0.7071: 2.2214, x=0.8536: arcsin(0.8536) ≈1.030 radians, since sin(1.030)≈0.857, so maybe 1.03. Then 0.8536^3 ≈0.620. So 1.03 / 0.620 ≈1.661. At x=1, 1.5708. So trapezoidal rule with two intervals: h=(1 - 0.7071)/2≈0.14645. The formula is h/2*(f(a) + 2f(a+h) + f(b)). So 0.14645/2*(2.2214 + 2*1.661 +1.5708) ≈0.0732*(2.2214 +3.322 +1.5708)=0.0732*(7.1142)≈0.520. That's close to 0.5, so maybe the exact answer is indeed 1/2. So the numerical approximation would be approximately 0.5. But let's use more intervals for better accuracy. Let's take four intervals. But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, trust the analytical result. Since the steps check out, the exact answer is 1/2. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 0.5. So the exact answer is 1/2, and numerical is 0.5. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me check again.

Original integral: ∫ arcsin(x)/x³ dx from 1/√2 to 1. Let me redo the integration by parts. Let u = arcsin(x), dv = x^{-3} dx. Then du = 1/√(1 - x²) dx, v = -1/(2x²). So integration by parts gives uv| - ∫v du. So:

[-arcsin(x)/(2x²)] from 1/√2 to 1 - ∫1/(2x²) * 1/√(1 - x²) dx.

Wait, the integral becomes + (1/2) ∫1/(x²√(1 - x²)) dx. Then, as before, substitution x = sinθ. Then dx = cosθ dθ, x from 1/√2 to 1 becomes θ from π/4 to π/2. The integral becomes ∫1/(sin²θ * cosθ) * cosθ dθ = ∫1/sin²θ dθ = -cotθ from π/4 to π/2. Which is 1. So (1/2)*1 = 1/2. So the integral is 1/2. So exact answer is 1/2, numerical is 0.5. Therefore, the JSON should be {"answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "numerical_answer": 0.5000000000}. But wait, let me check with another substitution. Let me try substitution t = 1/x. Let t = 1/x, then x = 1/t, dx = -1/t² dt. The limits when x=1/√2, t=√2; when x=1, t=1. The integral becomes ∫ from t=1 to t=√2 of arcsin(1/t)/( (1/t)^3 ) * (-1/t²) dt. The negative flips the limits: ∫ from √2 to 1 becomes ∫ from 1 to √2. The integrand becomes arcsin(1/t) * t³ * (1/t²) dt = ∫ arcsin(1/t) * t dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe not. Let's proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me consider differentiating arcsin(x). But I think the integration by parts approach is correct. So I think the exact answer is indeed 1/2, and numerical is 0.5. Therefore, the final answer is as above.
