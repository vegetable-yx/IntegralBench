Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is from 0 to 1 of x^(-1/4) times (1 - x)^(1/4) multiplied by the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I₁, evaluated at the fourth root of x(1 - x). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution or a known integral formula that can help here.

First, let me write down the integral again to make sure I have it right:

∫₀¹ x^(-1/4) (1 - x)^(1/4) I₁(√[4]{x(1 - x)}) dx

So, the integrand involves a product of x and (1 - x) raised to fractional powers and a modified Bessel function. Modified Bessel functions often show up in integrals involving exponentials or trigonometric functions, but I'm not sure how that connects here. Maybe a substitution can simplify the expression inside the Bessel function.

Let me consider a substitution to simplify the argument of the Bessel function. The argument is the fourth root of x(1 - x). Let's denote t = x(1 - x). Then, the fourth root of t would be t^(1/4). But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe a substitution that relates to trigonometric identities. For example, if we set x = sin²θ or something similar, but I need to check.

Wait, the limits are from 0 to 1, which is the interval where x(1 - x) is between 0 and 1/4. The substitution x = sin²θ would map x from 0 to 1 to θ from 0 to π/2. Let's try that. Let x = sin²θ, so dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then, 1 - x = cos²θ. Let's substitute into the integral:

x^(-1/4) = (sin²θ)^(-1/4) = sin^(-1/2)θ

(1 - x)^(1/4) = (cos²θ)^(1/4) = cos^(1/2)θ

The argument of the Bessel function becomes √[4]{x(1 - x)} = √[4]{sin²θ cos²θ} = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √(sinθ cosθ) = (sin(2θ)/2)^(1/2) = (sin(2θ))^(1/2)/2^(1/2)

But the Bessel function I₁ has an argument of √(sin(2θ)/2). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Let's write out the integral after substitution:

Original integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) [sin^(-1/2)θ] [cos^(1/2)θ] I₁(√(sinθ cosθ)) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the terms:

sin^(-1/2)θ * cos^(1/2)θ * 2 sinθ cosθ = 2 sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ

So the integral is 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ I₁(√(sinθ cosθ)) dθ

Hmm, not sure if this is better. Maybe another substitution. Let's think about the argument of the Bessel function. The modified Bessel function I₁(z) can be expressed in terms of a series expansion. Maybe expanding the Bessel function into its series and integrating term by term?

The modified Bessel function of the first kind I₁(z) has the series expansion:

I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (z/2)^{2k + 1} ) / (k! Γ(k + 2)) )

But substituting this into the integral would lead to an infinite series of integrals. Let's try that approach.

Let me denote z = √[4]{x(1 - x)}. Then, the argument of I₁ is z, so:

I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (z/2)^{2k + 1} ) / (k! (k + 1)!) )

Wait, because Γ(k + 2) = (k + 1)!.

Therefore, substituting into the integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ ( (√[4]{x(1 - x)} / 2 )^{2k + 1} ) / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] dx

Interchange the sum and integral (if valid):

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} [x(1 - x)]^{(2k + 1)/4} dx

Simplify the integrand:

x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} [x(1 - x)]^{(2k + 1)/4} = x^{(-1/4 + (2k + 1)/4)} (1 - x)^{(1/4 + (2k + 1)/4)} = x^{(2k)/4} (1 - x)^{(2k + 2)/4} = x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2}

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] ∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} dx

Now, the integral inside is the Beta function. Recall that ∫₀¹ x^{a - 1} (1 - x)^{b - 1} dx = B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b)

So here, a = (k/2) + 1, since the exponent on x is k/2, so a = k/2 + 1 (because Beta function is x^{a - 1} (1 - x)^{b - 1}, so a - 1 = k/2 => a = k/2 + 1, and similarly b - 1 = (k + 1)/2 => b = (k + 1)/2 + 1 = (k + 3)/2

Therefore, the integral is B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = Γ(k/2 + 1) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (k/2 + 1) + (k + 3)/2 )

Simplify the denominator:

(k/2 + 1) + (k + 3)/2 = (k/2 + (k + 3)/2 ) + 1 = ( (2k + 3)/2 ) + 1 = (2k + 3 + 2)/2 = (2k + 5)/2

So the Beta function becomes Γ(k/2 + 1) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

Therefore, the integral is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] * [ Γ(k/2 + 1) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can simplify the Gamma functions. Let's recall some properties of the Gamma function. For example, Γ(n + 1) = n Γ(n), and the duplication formula: Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^(1 - 2z) √π Γ(2z)

But here, the arguments are k/2 + 1 and (k + 3)/2. Let's see:

For Γ(k/2 + 1) and Γ( (k + 3)/2 )

If k is even, say k = 2m, then:

Γ(m + 1) Γ( (2m + 3)/2 ) = m! Γ( m + 3/2 )

If k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then:

Γ( (2m + 1)/2 + 1 ) Γ( (2m + 1 + 3)/2 ) = Γ( (2m + 3)/2 ) Γ( m + 2 )

But this might not lead to a straightforward simplification. Alternatively, perhaps using the duplication formula.

Alternatively, note that Γ(k/2 + 1) and Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) can be expressed in terms of factorials or other Gamma functions. Let's see:

Let’s consider specific values. For example, if k is even, let k = 2n:

Γ(2n/2 + 1) = Γ(n + 1) = n!

Γ( (2n + 3)/2 ) = Γ(n + 3/2 ) = (n + 1/2)(n - 1/2)...(1/2)√π

Similarly, if k is odd, k = 2n + 1:

Γ( (2n + 1)/2 + 1 ) = Γ(n + 3/2 )

Γ( (2n + 1 + 3)/2 ) = Γ(n + 2 ) = (n + 1)!

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can turn the original integral into a standard form. Let me think again about substitution. Let’s try t = x(1 - x). Then, the argument of the Bessel function is t^(1/4). But changing variables to t might complicate the limits and the Jacobian. Let’s compute dt/dx = 1 - 2x. Hmm, but integrating from x=0 to x=1, t goes from 0 to 0, but actually, t = x(1 - x) is symmetric around x=1/2, reaching a maximum of 1/4 at x=1/2. So maybe split the integral into two parts from 0 to 1/2 and 1/2 to 1, but that might not help.

Alternatively, use substitution t = x/(1 - x), but not sure.

Wait, another thought: the integral resembles the form of the Beta function multiplied by a Bessel function. There might be an integral formula involving Bessel functions and powers of x that can be used here. Let me check some integral tables or known integrals.

In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, for example, there are integrals involving Bessel functions. Let me recall some relevant ones. For example, equation 6.621.3 in G&R: ∫₀¹ x^{μ - 1} (1 - x)^{ν - 1} e^{-a x} dx, but that's with an exponential. Alternatively, integrals involving Bessel functions. Let me check 6.621:

Equation 6.621.1: ∫₀¹ x^{ν + 1} (1 - x²)^{μ - 1/2} J_ν (a x) dx = ... but this is for Bessel J, not modified Bessel I.

But maybe there's a similar formula for modified Bessel functions. Let me check 6.624.4:

∫₀^∞ x^{μ - 1} e^{-a x} I_ν (b x) dx = ... but this is over an infinite interval.

Alternatively, 6.625.1: ∫₀^1 x^{μ - 1} (1 - x)^{ν - 1} I_{2n} (a sqrt(x(1 - x))) dx = ... Hmm, this seems similar to our integral. Let me check.

Yes, in Gradshteyn-Ryzhik, 6.625.1:

∫₀¹ x^{μ - 1} (1 - x)^{ν - 1} I_{2n} (2a sqrt(x(1 - x))) dx = [Γ(μ) Γ(ν) / Γ(μ + ν)] e^{-a²} a^{2n} / (n! (μ + ν)_n) ) ₁F₁(μ; μ + ν; 2a²)

But our integral has I₁ with argument sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)}, which is (x(1 - x))^{1/4}. Let's see if this formula can be adapted.

Wait, in the formula, the argument of the Bessel function is 2a sqrt(x(1 - x)), which is 2a (x(1 - x))^{1/2}. In our case, the argument is (x(1 - x))^{1/4}. So if we set 2a (x(1 - x))^{1/2} = (x(1 - x))^{1/4}, then 2a = (x(1 - x))^{-1/4}, which depends on x, so that's not helpful. So maybe this formula isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps another formula. Let me check 6.625.2:

∫₀¹ x^{μ - 1} (1 - x)^{ν - 1} I_{2n + 1} (2a sqrt(x(1 - x))) dx = ... similar expression.

But again, the argument is different. Alternatively, maybe a different approach.

Wait, let's consider the integral representation of the modified Bessel function. The modified Bessel function I₁(z) can be written as:

I₁(z) = (z/2) ∫₀^π e^{z cosθ} cosθ dθ / π

But I'm not sure if substituting this into the integral would help. Let's try:

Original integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} * [ (sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)} / 2 ) ∫₀^π e^{sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)} cosφ} cosφ dφ / π ] dx

This seems even more complicated. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, recall that sometimes integrals involving Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let me think about the integrand x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} )

If we let t = x(1 - x), but as before, the substitution might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps expand I₁ in a power series and integrate term by term, as I started earlier.

Let me go back to the series expansion approach. We had:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ Γ(k/2 + 1) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) ]

Now, perhaps we can simplify the Gamma functions. Let's consider the terms:

Γ(k/2 + 1) and Γ( (k + 3)/2 )

Let’s split into cases where k is even and odd.

Case 1: k even, let k = 2m

Then:

Γ(2m/2 + 1) = Γ(m + 1) = m!

Γ( (2m + 3)/2 ) = Γ(m + 3/2 ) = (m + 1/2)(m - 1/2)...(1/2)√π = ( (2m + 1)!! / 2^{m + 1} ) √π )

And the denominator Γ( (2*2m + 5)/2 ) = Γ( (4m + 5)/2 ) = Γ(2m + 5/2 )

Similarly, using duplication formula:

Γ(2m + 5/2 ) = 2^{2m + 3/2} Γ(m + 5/4) Γ(m + 7/4) / √π

Wait, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, express Γ(m + 3/2 ) in terms of factorials:

Γ(m + 3/2 ) = ( (2m + 1)! ) / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) ) √π ?

Wait, let's recall that Γ(n + 1/2 ) = (2n)! √π / 4^n n! )

Yes, for example, Γ(1/2 ) = √π, Γ(3/2 ) = (1/2)√π, Γ(5/2 ) = (3/4)√π, etc. So in general:

Γ(m + 3/2 ) = ( (2m + 2)! ) / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) ) √π ?

Wait, let's check for m=0: Γ(3/2 ) = (1/2)√π. If m=0, then (2*0 + 2)! = 2! = 2, 4^{0 + 1} = 4, (0 + 1)! = 1, so 2 / (4 * 1) ) √π = (1/2)√π, which matches. For m=1: Γ(5/2 ) = (3/4)√π. According to formula: (2*1 + 2)! = 4! = 24, 4^{1 + 1} = 16, (1 + 1)! = 2, so 24 / (16 * 2 ) √π = 24 /32 √pi = 3/4 √pi, which is correct. So yes, Γ(m + 3/2 ) = ( (2m + 2)! ) / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) ) √π

Similarly, Γ(m + 1 ) = m!

So for even k=2m:

Γ(k/2 + 1 ) = Γ(m + 1 ) = m!

Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) = Γ(m + 3/2 ) = ( (2m + 2)! ) / (4^{m + 1} (m + 1)! ) ) √π

Denominator Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) = Γ(2m + 5/2 ) = Γ(2m + 2 + 1/2 ) = ( (4m + 3)! ) / ( 4^{2m + 2} (2m + 2)! ) ) √π ?

Wait, no. Let's use the same formula for Γ(n + 1/2 ). Let n = 2m + 2:

Γ(2m + 2 + 1/2 ) = Γ( (4m + 5)/2 ) = ?

Wait, perhaps better to use the duplication formula:

Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, express Γ(2m + 5/2 ):

Γ(2m + 5/2 ) = (2m + 3/2 )(2m + 1/2 )... (3/2 ) (1/2 ) √π )

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, let's use the Beta function expression. The Beta function B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So in our case, the integral term is B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

But perhaps using the duplication formula on Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 )

Let’s set z = k/2 + 1. Then, Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z - 1/2 )

Wait, not sure. Let me check the duplication formula again:

Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z )

Yes, that's the correct formula. So if we set z = k/2 + 1, then:

Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 1 + 1/2 ) = Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 3/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2(k/2 + 1)} √π Γ(2(k/2 + 1) )

Simplify:

2^{1 - (k + 2)} √π Γ(k + 2 )

= 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

But Γ(k + 2 ) = (k + 1)!.

So Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 3/2 ) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

But in our case, we have Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 )

Note that (k + 3)/2 = k/2 + 3/2 - k/2? Wait, no. Wait, (k + 3)/2 = k/2 + 3/2. So Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) = Γ(k/2 + 3/2 )

Therefore, Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 3/2 ) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

Therefore, the Beta function becomes:

B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

But Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) is Γ(k + 5/2 )

So, Γ(k + 5/2 ) = (k + 3/2 )(k + 1/2 )... (1/2 ) √π )

Alternatively, using the formula for Γ(n + 1/2 ):

Γ(k + 5/2 ) = Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) = ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π ?

Wait, let's check for k=0:

Γ(5/2 ) = 3/4 √π. If k=0, then (2*0 + 4)! = 4! = 24, 4^{0 + 2} = 16, (0 + 2)! = 2, so 24/(16*2) √π = 24/32 √pi = 3/4 √pi, which matches. So yes, Γ(k + 5/2 ) = ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π

Therefore, substituting back into the Beta function:

B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / [ ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! 

Denominator: (2k + 4)! / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π 

So the entire expression becomes:

[2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] * [4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) / (2k + 4)! ) ] / √π

The √π cancels out:

2^{-k -1} (k + 1)! * 4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Simplify 4^{k + 2} = 2^{2k + 4}, so:

2^{-k -1} * 2^{2k + 4} = 2^{k + 3}

So now:

2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Note that (2k + 4)! = (2(k + 2))! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (product of even numbers up to 2(k + 2)) )

But using the formula for double factorial:

(2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!! )

But perhaps another approach. Let's write (2k + 4)! = (2(k + 2))! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (product of odd numbers from 1 to 2k + 3?)

Wait, no. The formula is (2n)! = 2^n n! (2n - 1)!! )

So for n = k + 2:

(2(k + 2))! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (2(k + 2) - 1)!! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (2k + 3)!! )

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express (2k + 4)! = (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...2*1

But maybe express it in terms of factorials:

(2k + 4)! = (k + 2)! * 2^{k + 2} * (k + 2)(k + 3/2)(k + 1)... ?

Not sure. Alternatively, note that (k + 2)! (k + 1)! / (2k + 4)! ) = 1 / [ (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1) ... (k + 3) ) ]

But this seems complicated. Let's try to simplify the expression:

2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Let’s write (2k + 4)! = (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3)(k + 2)! )

Wait, no. Wait, (2k + 4)! = (2k + 4)(2k + 3)...(k + 3)(k + 2)(k + 1)...1 )

But perhaps we can write:

(2k + 4)! = (k + 2)! * product_{i=1}^{k + 2} (k + 2 + i )

But not sure. Alternatively, let's factor out 2^{k + 2} from (2k + 4)!:

(2k + 4)! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! * product_{i=1}^{k + 2} (2i - 1 + k + 2 - (k + 2)) )

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's take specific values for k to see if we can find a pattern.

Let’s take k=0:

Then, the expression becomes:

2^{0 + 3} (0 + 1)! (0 + 2)! / (2*0 + 4)! ) = 8 * 1 * 2 / 24 = 16 / 24 = 2/3

For k=0, the Beta function term is B(1, 3/2 ) = Γ(1)Γ(3/2 ) / Γ(5/2 ) = 1 * (√π / 2 ) / (3√π / 4 ) ) = (√π / 2 ) / (3√π / 4 ) = (1/2) / (3/4 ) = 2/3, which matches. So the expression simplifies to 2/3 for k=0.

Similarly, for k=1:

2^{1 + 3} (1 + 1)! (1 + 2)! / (2*1 + 4)! ) = 16 * 2 * 6 / 720 = 192 / 720 = 4/15

Check Beta function for k=1:

B(1.5, 2 ) = Γ(1.5)Γ(2 ) / Γ(3.5 ) = ( (√π / 2 ) * 1! ) / ( (15/8 )√π ) ) = (√π / 2 ) / (15√π / 8 ) = (1/2) / (15/8 ) = 4/15, which matches.

So the expression seems correct. Therefore, the Beta function term simplifies to 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ] * [2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ]

Simplify the terms inside the sum:

1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) * 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

The (k + 1)! cancels out:

1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! ) * 2^{k + 3} (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Simplify 2^{k + 3} / 2^{2k + 1} = 2^{ (k + 3) - (2k + 1) } = 2^{ -k + 2 } = 4 * 2^{-k }

So now:

4 * 2^{-k } / k! * (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Simplify (k + 2)! = (k + 2)(k + 1)! = (k + 2)(k + 1)k! )

But (k + 2)! / k! = (k + 2)(k + 1 )

Wait, no: (k + 2)! = (k + 2)(k + 1)k! ), so (k + 2)! / k! = (k + 2)(k + 1 )

But here, we have (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

So (2k + 4)! = (2k + 4)(2k + 3)...(k + 5)(k + 4)(k + 3)(k + 2)! )

So (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! = 1 / [ (2k + 4)(2k + 3)...(k + 3) )

But this is 1 / [ (k + 3)(k + 4)...(2k + 4) ) ]

Alternatively, note that (2k + 4)! = (2(k + 2))! = product from i=1 to 2(k + 2) of i

Which can be written as product from i=1 to k + 2 of (2i) * product from i=1 to k + 2 of (2i - 1 )

= 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! * product from i=1 to k + 2 of (2i - 1 )

Therefore, (2k + 4)! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! * (2k + 3)!! )

Where (2k + 3)!! is the double factorial: (2k + 3)(2k + 1)...5*3*1

Therefore, (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! = 1 / [2^{k + 2} (2k + 3)!! ]

So substituting back:

4 * 2^{-k } / k! * [1 / (2^{k + 2} (2k + 3)!! ) ]

= 4 / (2^{2k + 2} k! (2k + 3)!! )

But 2^{2k + 2} = 4^{k + 1 }, so:

4 / (4^{k + 1} k! (2k + 3)!! ) = 1 / (4^k k! (2k + 3)!! )

But (2k + 3)!! = (2k + 3)(2k + 1)...5*3*1

Alternatively, express (2k + 3)!! = (2k + 3)! / (2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Wait, the double factorial (2k + 3)!! = product_{i=0}^k (2i + 3 )

But there's a formula relating double factorial to regular factorial:

(2k + 3)!! = (2k + 3)! / (2^k k! )

Yes, because:

(2k + 3)! = (2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...2*1

= [ (2k + 3)(2k + 1)...3*1 ] * [ (2k + 2)(2k )...2 ]

= (2k + 3)!! * 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Therefore, (2k + 3)!! = (2k + 3)! / (2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Substituting back into the expression:

1 / (4^k k! (2k + 3)!! ) = 1 / (4^k k! * (2k + 3)! / (2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )) )

= 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! / (4^k k! (2k + 3)! )

= 2^{k + 1} (k! (k + 1) ) / (4^k k! (2k + 3)! )

= 2^{k + 1} (k + 1) / (4^k (2k + 3)! )

= (2^{k + 1} / 4^k ) * (k + 1) / (2k + 3)! )

= (2 / 4^k ) * (k + 1) / (2k + 3)! )

= 2^{1 - 2k} (k + 1) / (2k + 3)! )

But this seems to be leading us into a more complicated expression. Maybe we need to find another way to sum the series.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function. Let's recall that hypergeometric functions are defined as:

_pF_q(a_1, ..., a_p; b_1, ..., b_q; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (a_1)_k ... (a_p)_k / (b_1)_k ... (b_q)_k ] z^k / k!

Where (a)_k is the Pochhammer symbol.

Looking at our sum:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4 * 2^{-k } (k + 2)! / (k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

Wait, after simplifying, we had:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 4 * 2^{-k } (k + 2)! / (k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

But this seems messy. Alternatively, let's go back to the expression after substituting the Beta function:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ Γ(k/2 + 1) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) ]

But we found that this simplifies to:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ] / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

Which is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 2)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3 - 2k -1} (k + 2)! / (k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{2 - k} (k + 2)(k + 1) / (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{2 - k} (k + 2)(k + 1) / (2k + 4)! ) ]

Let’s shift the index m = k + 2, but not sure. Alternatively, let's write (2k + 4)! = (2(k + 2))! = (2m)! where m = k + 2. Then, k = m - 2. But when k=0, m=2. So the sum becomes:

Σ_{m=2}^∞ [ 2^{2 - (m - 2)} (m) (m - 1) / (2m)! ) ]

= Σ_{m=2}^∞ [ 2^{4 - m} m(m - 1) / (2m)! ) ]

But this might not help. Alternatively, note that 2^{4 - m} = 16 * 2^{-m}

So:

16 Σ_{m=2}^∞ [ m(m - 1) 2^{-m} / (2m)! ) ]

But this still doesn't resemble a standard series.

Alternatively, perhaps the original series can be expressed in terms of known functions. Let's consider the series:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (k + 1) 2^{ -k } / (2k + 3)! ) ]

But I don't recognize this series. Maybe it's a hypergeometric function. Let's try to express it in terms of ₀F₁ or ₁F₂.

Recall that ₀F₁(; b; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^k / ( (b)_k k! )

But our terms involve (k + 1) 2^{-k} / (2k + 3)! )

Let’s write (2k + 3)! = (2k + 3)(2k + 2)! = (2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)! )

But not helpful. Alternatively, express (2k + 3)! = 2^{2k + 3} (k + 1.5)_k (k + 1)! )

Not sure. Alternatively, note that (2k + 3)! = Γ(2k + 4 ) = (2k + 3)(2k + 2)...1

But I'm stuck here. Maybe it's better to look for a different approach to the original integral.

Let me think again about the integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} ) dx

Let’s make a substitution to simplify the argument of the Bessel function. Let’s set t = x(1 - x). Then, dt/dx = 1 - 2x. But integrating over x from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 1/4 and back to 0. So we can split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1/2 and from 1/2 to 1. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, use the substitution t = x^{1/4} or something else. Let me try t = x^{1/4}, so x = t^4, dx = 4t^3 dt. Then, when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=1. The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (t^4)^{-1/4} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( (t^4 (1 - t^4))^{1/4} ) * 4t^3 dt

Simplify:

t^{-1} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 - t^4)^{1/4} ) * 4t^3 dt

= 4 ∫₀¹ t^{2} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 - t^4)^{1/4} ) dt

Not sure if this helps. The argument of the Bessel function is now t (1 - t^4)^{1/4}, which might not be simpler.

Alternatively, consider another substitution. Let’s set u = x/(1 - x), which transforms the interval (0,1) to (0, ∞). But this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, consider the substitution y = sqrt(x(1 - x)). Then, y^2 = x - x^2, so x^2 - x + y^2 = 0. Solving for x gives x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4y^2)]/2. But this might complicate the limits and the integral.

Alternatively, think about the integral in terms of convolution or probability distributions, but I don't see a direct link.

Wait, another thought: the integrand resembles the form of a product of x and (1 - x) raised to certain powers times a Bessel function. Maybe this is related to the probability density function of a beta distribution multiplied by a Bessel function. There might be a known expectation value involving Bessel functions for beta-distributed variables.

Alternatively, consider using integral representation of the Bessel function. For example, I₁(z) can be expressed as:

I₁(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{z cosθ} cosθ dθ

Substituting this into the integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} [ (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{√[4]{x(1 - x)} cosφ} cosφ dφ ] dx

Interchange the order of integration:

(1/π) ∫₀^π cosφ [ ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} e^{√[4]{x(1 - x)} cosφ} dx ] dφ

But this seems even more complicated. However, perhaps the inner integral can be evaluated.

Let’s focus on the inner integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} e^{√[4]{x(1 - x)} cosφ} dx

Let’s make the substitution t = x(1 - x), similar to before. But again, this leads to a complicated expression. Alternatively, use the substitution x = sin²θ as before.

Let’s try x = sin²θ, dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then, 1 - x = cos²θ, and the inner integral becomes:

∫₀^(π/2) [ sin^{-1/2}θ ] [ cos^{1/2}θ ] e^{ (sinθ cosθ)^{1/2} cosφ } * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

2 sin^{-1/2}θ cos^{1/2}θ * sinθ cosθ e^{ sqrt(sinθ cosθ) cosφ } dθ

= 2 sin^{1/2}θ cos^{3/2}θ e^{ sqrt(sinθ cosθ) cosφ } dθ

Let’s set u = sqrt(sinθ cosθ) = (sinθ cosθ)^{1/2} = ( (sin2θ)/2 )^{1/2} = (sin2θ)^{1/2} / 2^{1/2}

But this substitution might not help. Alternatively, let’s set t = sqrt(sinθ cosθ). Then, t^2 = sinθ cosθ = (sin2θ)/2. But this leads to dt = [ (cos^2θ - sin^2θ)/ (2 sqrt(sinθ cosθ)) ) ] dθ, which complicates things.

Alternatively, consider expressing the exponential term in terms of a series expansion. Let’s expand e^{ sqrt(sinθ cosθ) cosφ } as a power series:

e^{ z cosφ } = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (z cosφ )^n / n! 

Where z = sqrt(sinθ cosθ )

So the inner integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{1/2}θ cos^{3/2}θ Σ_{n=0}^∞ ( (sqrt(sinθ cosθ ) cosφ )^n / n! ) dθ

= 2 Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosφ )^n / n! ∫₀^(π/2) sin^{1/2 + n/2}θ cos^{3/2 + n/2}θ dθ

This integral is similar to the Beta function. Let’s compute it:

∫₀^(π/2) sin^{a}θ cos^{b}θ dθ = 1/2 B( (a + 1)/2, (b + 1)/2 )

Here, a = 1/2 + n/2, b = 3/2 + n/2

So the integral becomes:

1/2 B( (1/2 + n/2 + 1)/2, (3/2 + n/2 + 1)/2 ) = 1/2 B( (3/2 + n/2)/2, (5/2 + n/2)/2 )

Simplify the arguments:

(3/2 + n/2)/2 = 3/4 + n/4

(5/2 + n/2)/2 = 5/4 + n/4

So the integral is 1/2 B(3/4 + n/4, 5/4 + n/4 )

Using the property of the Beta function, B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b)

So:

1/2 * Γ(3/4 + n/4) Γ(5/4 + n/4 ) / Γ(2 + n/2 )

But Γ(2 + n/2 ) = (1 + n/2 ) Γ(1 + n/2 ) = (1 + n/2 ) (n/2 )! if n is even, but for general n, it's expressed via Gamma functions.

This seems very complicated. Therefore, the inner integral becomes:

2 * Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosφ )^n / n! * [1/2 Γ(3/4 + n/4) Γ(5/4 + n/4 ) / Γ(2 + n/2 ) ]

= Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosφ )^n / n! * Γ(3/4 + n/4) Γ(5/4 + n/4 ) / Γ(2 + n/2 )

But this series doesn't seem to have a closed form. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.

At this point, I'm stuck trying to evaluate the integral either through substitution, series expansion, or integral transforms. Maybe I need to look for a different approach or recall a specific integral formula that applies here.

Wait, another idea: the integral might be related to the beta function multiplied by a hypergeometric function. Let me recall that integrals of the form ∫₀¹ x^{c - 1} (1 - x)^{d - c - 1} _pF_q(...; x) dx can sometimes be expressed in terms of higher hypergeometric functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the original integral can be expressed as a product of Gamma functions and a hypergeometric function. Let me consider the form of the integrand: x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} )

If we let z = (x(1 - x))^{1/4}, then the Bessel function I₁(z) can be expressed in its series form, and the integral becomes a sum of Beta functions, as we tried earlier. But the sum didn't simplify into a known function.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection to the Meijer G-function or other special functions, but I'm not familiar enough with those to proceed.

Given that I'm stuck analytically, perhaps I should consider evaluating the integral numerically to get an approximate value. However, the problem asks for an exact analytical solution first. Maybe there's a trick I'm missing.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = x^{1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4}. But this might not help. Alternatively, let's set t = x/(1 - x), which transforms the integral to:

x = t/(1 + t), 1 - x = 1/(1 + t), dx = dt/(1 + t)^2

The limits become t=0 to t=∞. The integral becomes:

∫₀^∞ [ (t/(1 + t))^{-1/4} (1/(1 + t))^{1/4} I₁( (t/(1 + t) * 1/(1 + t))^{1/4} ) * dt/(1 + t)^2 ]

Simplify the integrand:

(t^{-1/4} (1 + t)^{1/4} ) (1 + t)^{-1/4} I₁( (t)^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2} ) * (1 + t)^{-2} dt

= t^{-1/4} I₁( t^{1/4} (1 + t)^{-1/2} ) (1 + t)^{-2} dt

This doesn't look any better.

Another approach: Let's consider the integral as a Mellin transform. The Mellin transform of I₁(z) might be known. The Mellin transform of I₁(az) is:

∫₀^∞ x^{s - 1} I₁(a x) dx = a^{-s} 2^{s - 1} Γ(s/2 + 1/2 ) / Γ(1 - s/2 )

But this is for the integral over all positive x, and our integral is from 0 to 1. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the original integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the argument of the Bessel function is (x(1 - x))^{1/4}. Maybe using convolution or multiplication theorem for Bessel functions.

Alternatively, think of the integral as a product of functions and use integration by parts. Let’s try that. Let’s set u = I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} ), dv = x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} dx. Then, du would be the derivative of I₁ with respect to x, which is I₁’(z) * derivative of z with respect to x. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, recall that the derivative of I₁(z) is I₀(z) - I₁(z)/z. But not sure.

Given that I'm not making progress analytically, perhaps the integral is designed to be evaluated using a specific substitution or identity that I'm missing. Let me think again about the original integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} ) dx

Let’s make the substitution t = x^{1/4}, so x = t^4, dx = 4t^3 dt. Then, 1 - x = 1 - t^4. The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (t^4)^{-1/4} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( (t^4 (1 - t^4))^{1/4} ) * 4t^3 dt

Wait, no, x^{-1/4} = t^{-1}, (1 - x)^{1/4} = (1 - t^4)^{1/4}, and the argument of I₁ is (t^4 (1 - t^4))^{1/4} = t (1 - t^4)^{1/4}

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ t^{-1} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 - t^4)^{1/4} ) * 4t^3 dt

= 4 ∫₀¹ t^{2} (1 - t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 - t^4)^{1/4} ) dt

Not sure if this helps. Let’s denote z = t (1 - t^4)^{1/4}. Then, dz/dt = (1 - t^4)^{1/4} + t * (1/4)(1 - t^4)^{-3/4} (-4t^3 ) = (1 - t^4)^{1/4} - t^4 (1 - t^4)^{-3/4} = [ (1 - t^4) - t^4 ] / (1 - t^4)^{3/4} ) = (1 - 2t^4 ) / (1 - t^4)^{3/4 }

This seems complicated. Maybe not helpful.

At this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe the integral has a known result that I'm not aware of. Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the Beta function multiplied by a constant. Let me try to compute it numerically to see if it matches a known value.

Let’s approximate the integral numerically. The integrand is x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} ) from 0 to 1.

First, note that x^{-1/4} is integrable on [0,1] because the exponent -1/4 > -1. Similarly, (1 - x)^{1/4} is also integrable.

Let’s compute the integral numerically. To do this, I can use numerical integration methods like adaptive quadrature. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll approximate it using known values or series expansion.

Alternatively, use substitution to make the integral more manageable. Let’s try substitution t = x(1 - x). Then, dt/dx = 1 - 2x. But integrating from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 1/4 and back to 0. So split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1/2 and 1/2 to 1.

Let’s make the substitution t = x(1 - x). For x in [0, 1/2], t increases from 0 to 1/4. For x in [1/2, 1], t decreases back to 0. So the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^{1/4} x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( t^{1/4} ) * (dx/dt) dt

But solving for x in terms of t is complicated because x(1 - x) = t => x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4t)]/2. For x in [0, 1/2], we take the negative sign: x = [1 - sqrt(1 - 4t)]/2.

Then, dx/dt = [ ( - (-4) ) / (2 sqrt(1 - 4t)) ) ] / 2 = [ 2 / sqrt(1 - 4t) ) ] / 2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 4t )

So the integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^{1/4} [ ([1 - sqrt(1 - 4t)]/2 )^{-1/4} (1 - [1 - sqrt(1 - 4t)]/2 )^{1/4} I₁(t^{1/4} ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - 4t)) ] dt

This seems very complicated to evaluate even numerically. Alternatively, use numerical integration techniques like Simpson's rule or use a calculator.

Alternatively, since the problem requires a numerical approximation, perhaps use a computational tool. But since I need to provide the steps, I'll proceed with an approximate method.

Let’s approximate the integral using a series expansion of the Bessel function and integrate term by term.

Recall that I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (z/2)^{2k + 1} ) / (k! (k + 1)! )

So the integrand becomes:

x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( ( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} / 2 )^{2k + 1} ) / (k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( (x(1 - x))^{(2k + 1)/4} / 2^{2k + 1} ) x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} / (k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( x^{(2k + 1)/4 - 1/4} (1 - x)^{(2k + 1)/4 + 1/4} ) / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ ( x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} ) / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

Which is the same as we had earlier. Then, integrating term by term:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ] B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 )

As before. We found that this sum is difficult to evaluate analytically, but perhaps we can compute it numerically by summing terms until convergence.

Let’s compute the first few terms:

For k=0:

Term = [1 / (2^{1 * 0! 1! ) ] * B(1, 3/2 )

= [1 / (2 * 1 * 1 ) ] * [Γ(1)Γ(3/2 ) / Γ(5/2 ) ]

Γ(1) = 1, Γ(3/2 ) = (1/2)√π, Γ(5/2 ) = (3/4)√π

So B(1, 3/2 ) = (1 * (1/2)√π ) / (3/4)√π ) = (1/2) / (3/4 ) = 2/3

Term = (1/2) * (2/3 ) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333

For k=1:

Term = [1 / (2^{3} 1! 2! ) ] * B(1.5, 2 )

= [1 / (8 * 1 * 2 ) ] * [Γ(1.5)Γ(2 ) / Γ(3.5 ) ]

Γ(1.5 ) = (1/2)√π ≈ 0.8862269255

Γ(2 ) = 1! = 1

Γ(3.5 ) = (5/2)(3/2)(1/2)√π ≈ (15/8)√π ≈ 1.329340388

So B(1.5, 2 ) = (0.8862269255 * 1 ) / 1.329340388 ≈ 0.6666666667

Term = (1/16 ) * 0.6666666667 ≈ 0.04166666667

For k=2:

Term = [1 / (2^{5} 2! 3! ) ] * B(2, 2.5 )

= [1 / (32 * 2 * 6 ) ] * [Γ(2)Γ(2.5 ) / Γ(4.5 ) ]

Γ(2 ) = 1

Γ(2.5 ) = (3/2)(1/2)√π ≈ 1.329340388

Γ(4.5 ) = (7/2)(5/2)(3/2)(1/2)√π ≈ (105/16)√π ≈ 5.317361572

So B(2, 2.5 ) = (1 * 1.329340388 ) / 5.317361572 ≈ 0.25

Term = (1/(32 * 12 )) * 0.25 ≈ (1/384 ) * 0.25 ≈ 0.0006510416667

For k=3:

Term = [1 / (2^{7} 6 * 24 ) ] * B(2.5, 3 )

= [1 / (128 * 6 * 24 ) ] * [Γ(2.5 )Γ(3 ) / Γ(5.5 ) ]

Γ(2.5 ) ≈ 1.329340388

Γ(3 ) = 2! = 2

Γ(5.5 ) = (9/2)(7/2)(5/2)(3/2)(1/2)√π ≈ (945/32)√π ≈ 29.6088132

B(2.5, 3 ) = (1.329340388 * 2 ) / 29.6088132 ≈ 0.08928571429

Term = (1/(128 * 6 * 24 )) * 0.08928571429 ≈ (1/18432 ) * 0.08928571429 ≈ 4.846560846e-6

Adding these terms:

k=0: 0.3333333333

k=1: +0.04166666667 ≈ 0.375

k=2: +0.0006510416667 ≈ 0.3756510417

k=3: +4.846560846e-6 ≈ 0.3756558882

Higher terms will contribute even less. So the sum converges to approximately 0.375656...

But wait, the first few terms sum to about 0.375656. However, let's check k=4:

k=4:

Term = [1 / (2^{9} 24 * 120 ) ] * B(3, 3.5 )

= [1 / (512 * 24 * 120 ) ] * [Γ(3 )Γ(3.5 ) / Γ(6.5 ) ]

Γ(3 ) = 2! = 2

Γ(3.5 ) ≈ 3.32335097

Γ(6.5 ) = (11/2)(9/2)(7/2)(5/2)(3/2)(1/2)√π ≈ (10395/64)√π ≈ 163.6246172

B(3, 3.5 ) = (2 * 3.32335097 ) / 163.6246172 ≈ 0.04047619048

Term = (1/(512 * 24 * 120 )) * 0.04047619048 ≈ (1/1,474,560 ) * 0.04047619048 ≈ 2.745e-8

Negligible. So the sum converges to approximately 0.375656...

But wait, the numerical approximation after four terms is about 0.375656. However, let's check with a numerical integration.

Alternatively, for a better approximation, let's use more terms. But given the terms are getting very small quickly, the sum is likely converging to around 0.375656.

But let's check with k=0 to k=3:

0.3333333333 + 0.04166666667 = 0.375

+0.0006510416667 = 0.3756510417

+4.846560846e-6 = 0.3756558882

So approximately 0.375656. However, this seems lower than expected. Let's check with a numerical integration.

Alternatively, use a calculator or software to compute the integral numerically. For example, using Wolfram Alpha, the integral can be computed numerically.

However, since I can't access external tools, I'll proceed with the series approximation. The sum of the first few terms gives approximately 0.375656. However, considering the higher terms contribute very little, the exact value is likely around 0.375656. But let's check for possible errors.

Wait, the first term for k=0 was 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333, k=1 term 0.04166666667, which is 1/24 ≈ 0.04166666667. Then k=2 term is 0.0006510416667, which is about 1/1536. So the sum is approaching approximately 0.375656.

But let's consider that the exact value might be a simple fraction. 0.375656 is approximately 0.375656, which is close to 3/8 = 0.375 or 5/13 ≈ 0.3846. But not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to π or other constants.

Alternatively, the exact value might be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. Let's recall that the sum we derived is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) ) ]

But this seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps there's a known integral that evaluates to a specific value.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the Beta function with parameters involving 3/4 and 5/4. For example, B(3/4, 5/4 ) = Γ(3/4)Γ(5/4 ) / Γ(2 ) = Γ(3/4)Γ(5/4 ) / 1

But Γ(3/4 )Γ(5/4 ) = π / sin(π/4 ) = π / (√2/2 ) = π√2

So B(3/4, 5/4 ) = π√2

But how does this relate to our integral? Not directly.

Alternatively, the integral might be equal to 2^{1/2} Γ(3/4 )^2 / π, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might evaluate to 1. But our numerical approximation suggests around 0.375, which is less than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral equals 1/2. But 0.375 is 3/8, which is 0.375.

Alternatively, check if the numerical approximation matches a known constant. For example, 0.375656 is approximately 0.375656, which is close to 3/8 = 0.375, but slightly higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 3/8. Let's check with the series sum:

If the exact value is 3/8 = 0.375, but our sum after three terms is 0.3756558882, which is slightly higher. However, the higher terms are positive, so the sum converges to something slightly above 0.375. Therefore, 3/8 might be the exact value, and the approximation is converging to it.

But why would the sum of the series be 3/8? Let's check:

If the integral equals 3/8, then the sum of the series must be 3/8. Let's see:

The first term is 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333

Second term is 1/24 ≈ 0.04166666667

Third term is 1/1536 ≈ 0.0006510416667

Fourth term is ~4.84e-6 ≈ 0.00000484

So sum is approximately 0.3333333333 + 0.04166666667 = 0.375

Then, the next terms add about 0.000651..., which would make it 0.375651..., but if the exact value is 3/8 = 0.375, then the higher terms must cancel out. But in our case, all terms are positive, so the sum must be greater than 0.375. Therefore, the exact value cannot be 3/8.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 1/2. But the sum is approaching 0.375, so that's not likely.

Alternatively, the exact value might be π/8 ≈ 0.3927, which is closer to our approximation of 0.3756. But still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral evaluates to Γ(3/4 )^2 / (2√π ) ≈ (1.2254167024 )^2 / (2 * 1.7724538509 ) ≈ 1.501825272 / 3.5449077018 ≈ 0.4233, which is higher than our approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is 2/5 = 0.4, but our approximation is 0.3756.

Given that I'm unable to find an exact analytical solution and the numerical approximation converges to approximately 0.375656, I'll proceed to report this as the numerical answer. However, I need to check if there's a mistake in the series expansion approach.

Wait, let's re-express the sum:

After simplifying, the integral is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ] / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 2)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 2)(k + 1) / (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3) )

But this is still complicated. Alternatively, note that (2k + 4)! = (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3)(k + 2)! )

So (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! = 1 / [ (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3) )

But this is 1 / [ (k + 3)(k + 4)...(2k + 4) ) ]

But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, consider that the term for k=0 is 2^{3} (0 + 1)! (0 + 2)! / (2*0 + 4)! ) / (2^{1} 0! 1! ) = 8 * 1 * 2 / 24 / (2 * 1 * 1 ) = 16 / 24 / 2 = 1/3, which matches.

Similarly, for k=1: 2^{4} * 2 * 6 / 720 / (8 * 1 * 2 ) = 16 * 12 / 720 / 16 = 192 / 11520 = 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667, but earlier calculation gave 0.04166666667. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, the expression after simplifying was:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ] / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ 2^{k + 3} (k + 2)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

For k=1:

2^{1 + 3} (1 + 2)! / (2^{2*1 + 1} 1! (2*1 + 4)! ) = 16 * 6 / (2^3 * 1 * 6! ) = 96 / (8 * 1 * 720 ) = 96 / 5760 = 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

But earlier calculation for k=1 term was 0.04166666667. This suggests a mistake in the simplification steps.

Wait, this indicates that there was an error in the simplification process. Let's go back.

Original integral after substitution:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) ]

We used the duplication formula and found that:

Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

But this might not be correct for all k. Let's recheck the duplication formula application.

The duplication formula is:

Γ(z) Γ(z + 1/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z )

In our case, z = k/2 + 1. Then:

Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 1 + 1/2 ) = Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ(k/2 + 3/2 ) = 2^{1 - 2(k/2 + 1)} √π Γ(2(k/2 + 1 ) )

= 2^{1 - k - 2} √π Γ(k + 2 )

= 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, Γ(k/2 + 1 ) Γ( (k + 3)/2 ) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! )

Then, the Beta function term is:

B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

But Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) = Γ(k + 5/2 )

Using the formula for Γ(k + 5/2 ):

Γ(k + 5/2 ) = (k + 3/2 ) Γ(k + 3/2 )

= (k + 3/2 )(k + 1/2 ) Γ(k + 1/2 )

But this might not help. Alternatively, using the relation:

Γ(k + 5/2 ) = ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π )

As we derived earlier.

Therefore, substituting back:

B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / [ ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π ]

= 2^{-k -1} (k + 1)! * 4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

= 2^{-k -1} * 2^{2k + 4} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

= 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{k + 3} / (2^{2k + 1} k! ) ] * [ (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ]

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{ -k + 2 } / k! ] * [ (k + 2)(k + 1) / (2k + 4)(2k + 3)...(k + 3) ) ]

But this is the same as before. For k=1:

2^{-1 + 2} / 1! * (2 * 3 ) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 ) = 2^1 / 1 * 6 / 360 = 2 * 6 / 360 = 12 / 360 = 1/30 ≈ 0.03333333333

But earlier calculation for k=1 term was 0.04166666667. This discrepancy suggests a mistake in the simplification steps.

Wait, no. Let's compute the term for k=1 correctly:

Original term after substitution:

[1 / (2^{2*1 + 1} 1! 2! ) ] * B(1.5, 2 )

= [1 / (8 * 1 * 2 ) ] * [Γ(1.5 )Γ(2 ) / Γ(3.5 ) ]

= [1/16 ] * [ (√π/2 ) * 1 / ( (3/4)√π ) ]

= [1/16 ] * [ (1/2 ) / (3/4 ) ]

= [1/16 ] * [ 2/3 ] = 1/24 ≈ 0.04166666667

But according to the simplified expression:

[2^{-k + 2 } / k! ] * [ (k + 2)(k + 1) / (2k + 4)! ) ]

For k=1:

2^{-1 + 2 } / 1! * (3 * 2 ) / 6! = 2^{1} / 1 * 6 / 720 = 2 * 6 / 720 = 12 / 720 = 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

This is different. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the simplification steps. This indicates that the earlier simplification is incorrect. Therefore, the mistake must be in the step where we expressed Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) as ( (2k + 4)! ) / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ) √π )

Let’s re-examine that step. For Γ(k + 5/2 ), which is Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

Using the formula Γ(n + 1/2 ) = (2n)! √π / 4^n n! )

But here, Γ(k + 5/2 ) = Γ( (2k + 5)/2 )

Let’s set m = k + 2, then Γ(m + 1/2 ) = (2m)! √π / 4^m} m! )

But k + 5/2 = m + 1/2 where m = k + 2. Therefore:

Γ(k + 5/2 ) = Γ(m + 1/2 ) = (2m)! √π / (4^m m! )

= (2(k + 2))! √π / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! )

Therefore, Γ( (2k + 5)/2 ) = Γ(k + 5/2 ) = (2k + 4)! √π / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! )

Therefore, substituting back into the Beta function:

B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 ) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / [ (2k + 4)! √π / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! ) ]

= [2^{-k -1} (k + 1)! ] * [4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ]

= 2^{-k -1} * 2^{2k + 4} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

= 2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, the term for k=1 is:

2^{1 + 3} (1 + 1)! (1 + 2)! / (2*1 + 4)! ) / (2^{2*1 + 1} 1! (1 + 1)! )

= 16 * 2 * 6 / 720 / (8 * 1 * 2 )

= 192 / 720 / 16

= 192 / 11520

= 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

But earlier calculation using the Beta function gave 0.04166666667. This discrepancy indicates a mistake in the application of the formula.

Wait, no. The term in the sum after simplification is:

[2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ] / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

= [2^{k + 3} (k + 2)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (2k + 4)! ) ]

For k=1:

2^{4} * 3! / (2^{3} * 1! * 6! )

= 16 * 6 / (8 * 1 * 720 )

= 96 / 5760

= 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

But earlier, using the Beta function directly, we had:

[1 / (2^{3} 1! 2! ) ] * B(1.5, 2 ) = [1/16 ] * (2/3 ) = 1/24 ≈ 0.04166666667

This inconsistency suggests a mistake in the simplification process. Therefore, the error must be in the step where we substituted the Beta function.

Wait, the original integral is:

∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} dx = B(k/2 + 1, (k + 3)/2 )

But for k=1, this becomes B(1.5, 2 )

Which is Γ(1.5 )Γ(2 ) / Γ(3.5 ) = ( (√π/2 ) * 1 ) / ( (15/8 )√π ) ) = (1/2 ) / (15/8 ) = 4/15 ≈ 0.2666666667

Then, the term for k=1 is:

[1 / (2^{3} 1! 2! ) ] * 4/15 = [1/8 * 1 * 2 ] * 4/15 = [1/16 ] * 4/15 = 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

Which matches the simplified expression. Therefore, the earlier calculation using the Beta function directly was incorrect. The correct term for k=1 is 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667, not 0.04166666667. This indicates a mistake in the initial calculation.

Therefore, correcting the terms:

k=0: 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333

k=1: 1/60 ≈ 0.01666666667

k=2: [1 / (2^{5} 2! 3! ) ] * B(2, 2.5 )

= [1 / (32 * 2 * 6 ) ] * [Γ(2 )Γ(2.5 ) / Γ(4.5 ) ]

Γ(2 ) = 1

Γ(2.5 ) = 3/4 √π ≈ 1.329340388

Γ(4.5 ) = 105/16 √π ≈ 5.317361572

So B(2, 2.5 ) = (1 * 1.329340388 ) / 5.317361572 ≈ 0.25

Term = (1/(32 * 12 )) * 0.25 ≈ 0.0006510416667

k=2 term: 0.0006510416667

k=3:

[1 / (2^{7} 6 * 24 ) ] * B(2.5, 3 )

= [1 / (128 * 6 * 24 ) ] * [Γ(2.5 )Γ(3 ) / Γ(5.5 ) ]

Γ(2.5 ) ≈ 1.329340388

Γ(3 ) = 2

Γ(5.5 ) ≈ 29.6088132

B(2.5, 3 ) = (1.329340388 * 2 ) / 29.6088132 ≈ 0.08928571429

Term = (1/(128 * 6 * 24 )) * 0.08928571429 ≈ 4.846560846e-6

So sum:

k=0: 0.3333333333

k=1: +0.01666666667 ≈ 0.35

k=2: +0.0006510416667 ≈ 0.3506510417

k=3: +4.846560846e-6 ≈ 0.3506558882

Higher terms are negligible. So the sum converges to approximately 0.350656.

This is significantly different from the previous incorrect calculation. Therefore, the correct numerical approximation is approximately 0.350656.

But this still doesn't match any obvious exact value. Let's check with k=4:

k=4:

Term = [1 / (2^{9} 24 * 120 ) ] * B(3, 3.5 )

= [1 / (512 * 24 * 120 ) ] * [Γ(3 )Γ(3.5 ) / Γ(6.5 ) ]

Γ(3 ) = 2

Γ(3.5 ) ≈ 3.32335097

Γ(6.5 ) ≈ 163.6246172

B(3, 3.5 ) = (2 * 3.32335097 ) / 163.6246172 ≈ 0.04047619048

Term = (1/(512 * 24 * 120 )) * 0.04047619048 ≈ 2.745e-8

Negligible.

So the sum converges to approximately 0.350656. This is approximately 0.3507.

But what is this value? Let's check if it's related to π or other constants. 0.3507 is approximately 0.35, which is 7/20. But 7/20 = 0.35, which is close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 2/5.7 ≈ 0.350877, which is close to the approximation. But this is not a standard fraction.

Alternatively, the exact value might be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. Let's consider:

The sum is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{k + 3} (k + 1)! (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! ) ] / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 2) / (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3) )

But this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a hypergeometric function. Let's consider:

The general term of the sum is:

Term_k = 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 2) / [ (2k + 4)(2k + 3)(2k + 2)(2k + 1)...(k + 3) ) ]

But this is equivalent to:

Term_k = 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 2) / [ (2k + 4)! / (k + 2)! ) ]

= 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 2) (k + 2)! / (2k + 4)! )

= 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 3)! / (2k + 4)! )

But this doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, note that (2k + 4)! = (2(k + 2))! = 2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (2k + 3)!! )

So Term_k = 2^{ -k + 2 } (k + 3)! / (2^{k + 2} (k + 2)! (2k + 3)!! ) )

= 2^{ -2k } (k + 3) / ( (2k + 3)!! )

But this still doesn't resemble a standard series.

Given that I'm unable to find an exact solution and the numerical approximation converges to approximately 0.350656, I'll proceed to report this as the numerical answer. However, the problem states that the integral can be computed analytically, so there must be an exact solution that I'm missing.

Wait, let's consider the original integral again:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I₁( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} ) dx

Let’s make the substitution t = (x(1 - x))^{1/4}. Then, t^4 = x(1 - x). Differentiating both sides:

4t^3 dt = (1 - 2x) dx

But solving for dx in terms of dt is complicated because x is a function of t. However, we can express x in terms of t:

From t^4 = x - x^2, we get x^2 - x + t^4 = 0. Solving for x:

x = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4t^4 ) ] / 2

For x in [0, 1], we take the negative root for x in [0, 1/2] and the positive root for x in [1/2, 1]. This substitution splits the integral into two parts, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, consider that the integral might be related to the modified Bessel function's integral representation. For example, I₁(z) can be expressed as:

I₁(z) = (z/2) ∫₀^π e^{z cosθ} cosθ dθ / π

Substituting this into the integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} ( (x(1 - x))^{1/4} / 2 ) ∫₀^π e^{(x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ} cosθ dθ / π dx

= (1/(2π)) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} (x(1 - x))^{1/4} e^{(x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ} dx dθ

= (1/(2π)) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} (x(1 - x))^{1/4} e^{(x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ} dx dθ

Simplify the integrand:

x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} (x(1 - x))^{1/4} = x^{-1/4 + 1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4 + 1/4} = (1 - x)^{1/2}

So the integral becomes:

(1/(2π)) ∫₀^π cosθ ∫₀¹ (1 - x)^{1/2} e^{(x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ} dx dθ

But this still seems complicated. However, the inner integral is now ∫₀¹ (1 - x)^{1/2} e^{(x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ} dx. Let's make the substitution t = x(1 - x). Then, dt = (1 - 2x) dx. But this leads to the same issues as before.

Alternatively, expand the exponential term in a Taylor series:

e^{z} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^n / n!

Where z = (x(1 - x))^{1/4} cosθ

So the inner integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosθ )^n / n! ∫₀¹ (1 - x)^{1/2} (x(1 - x))^{n/4} dx

= Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosθ )^n / n! ∫₀¹ x^{n/4} (1 - x)^{n/4 + 1/2} dx

= Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosθ )^n / n! B(n/4 + 1, n/4 + 3/2 )

= Σ_{n=0}^∞ (cosθ )^n / n! [ Γ(n/4 + 1 ) Γ(n/4 + 3/2 ) / Γ(n/2 + 5/2 ) ]

This series is then integrated over θ from 0 to π, multiplied by cosθ and divided by 2π. This seems extremely complicated and unlikely to lead to a closed-form expression.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the integral evaluates to a value of approximately 0.350656 based on the series approximation, and the exact form might involve hypergeometric functions or other special functions not readily reducible to elementary terms. However, since the problem states that an exact analytical solution exists, I must have missed a key insight.

Wait, another idea: the integral might be related to the beta function multiplied by a Bessel function evaluated at a specific point. Let me recall that integrals of the form ∫₀¹ x^{a} (1 - x)^{b} I_v(c x^{d} (1 - x)^{e} ) dx can sometimes be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. However, I'm not aware of a specific formula.

Alternatively, consider that the argument of the Bessel function is (x(1 - x))^{1/4}, which is symmetric around x=1/2. This suggests that the integral might be expressible in terms of a single variable substitution centered at x=1/2. Let’s set x = 1/2 + t, so the integral becomes:

∫_{-1/2}^{1/2} (1/2 + t)^{-1/4} (1/2 - t)^{1/4} I₁( ( (1/2 + t)(1/2 - t) )^{1/4} ) dt

Simplify the argument of the Bessel function:

( (1/2 + t)(1/2 - t) )^{1/4} = (1/4 - t^2 )^{1/4}

The integrand becomes:

(1/2 + t)^{-1/4} (1/2 - t)^{1/4} I₁( (1/4 - t^2 )^{1/4} )

This substitution might not help, but it highlights the symmetry of the integrand. Perhaps expanding the integrand in a power series around t=0.

However, this seems complicated. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the exact analytical solution is not forthcoming and proceed to report the numerical approximation obtained from the series expansion, which is approximately 0.350656.

However, given that the problem requires an exact analytical solution, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me consider one last idea: the integral might be related to the integral of a Bessel function times a power function, which can be expressed using the following identity:

∫₀¹ x^{μ - 1} (1 - x)^{ν - 1} I_{2n + 1} (a sqrt(x(1 - x)) ) dx = ... 

But I don't have access to this specific formula. However, if such an identity exists, it might allow expressing the integral in terms of gamma functions and hypergeometric functions.

Given that I'm unable to find the exact solution and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.350656, I'll proceed to report this as the numerical answer. The exact answer might involve hypergeometric functions, but without further information, I can't provide the exact form. However, the problem states that an exact analytical solution exists, so I must have missed a key step.

Wait, perhaps the integral can be expressed as a simple multiple of a known constant. Let me consider the numerical approximation of 0.350656. Converting this to a fraction, it's approximately 0.350656 = 350656/1000000 = 21916/62500 = 5479/15625 ≈ 0.350656. But this is not a standard fraction.

Alternatively, check if 0.350656 is approximately equal to π/9 ≈ 0.3490658504, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, sqrt(2)/4 ≈ 0.3535533906, which is also close.

Alternatively, 2/5.7 ≈ 0.350877193, which is very close to the numerical approximation. But this is not a standard constant.

Given that I'm unable to find an exact analytical solution and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.350656, I'll proceed to report this as the numerical answer. The exact answer might require a more advanced technique or a specific integral formula that I'm not recalling.
