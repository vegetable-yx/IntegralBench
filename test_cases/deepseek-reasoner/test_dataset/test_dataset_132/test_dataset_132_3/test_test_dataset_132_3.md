Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is from 0 to 1 of x^(-1/4) times (1 - x)^(1/4) multiplied by the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I₁, evaluated at the fourth root of x(1 - x). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution or a known integral formula that can help here.

First, let me recall some properties of Bessel functions. The modified Bessel function I₁(z) is a solution to the differential equation z²y'' + zy' - (z² + 1)y = 0. But how does that help with the integral? Maybe there's an integral representation of I₁ that could be useful here. Alternatively, perhaps this integral is related to some standard integral involving Bessel functions.

Looking at the integrand: x^(-1/4)(1 - x)^(1/4)I₁(√[4]{x(1 - x)}). Let me make a substitution to simplify the expression inside the Bessel function. Let’s set t = x(1 - x). Then, the fourth root of t would be t^(1/4). But I'm not sure if that substitution helps directly. Alternatively, maybe a substitution to make the limits symmetric or to turn it into a standard Beta function form.

Wait, the integral is from 0 to 1, which is the interval where x(1 - x) is between 0 and 0.25. The presence of x^(-1/4) and (1 - x)^(1/4) suggests that the integrand has singularities at x=0 and x=1, but they might be integrable since the exponents are greater than -1. Let me check: x^(-1/4) is integrable near 0 because -1/4 > -1, and (1 - x)^(1/4) is integrable near 1 because 1/4 > -1. So the integral should converge.

Now, thinking about possible substitutions. The integral resembles the Beta function, which is ∫₀¹ x^{c-1}(1 - x)^{d-1} dx = B(c, d) = Γ(c)Γ(d)/Γ(c + d). But here we have an extra Bessel function term. Maybe there's an integral formula involving Bessel functions and powers of x that can be used here.

I remember that some Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. For example, I₁(z) can be written as (z/2) * ₀F₁(2; (z/2)²). But I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, there might be an integral representation of I₁ that could be substituted into the integral.

Let me look up integral representations of I₁. The modified Bessel function of the first kind has an integral representation: I₁(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{z cos θ} cos θ dθ. But I don't see immediately how to use that here. Alternatively, there's a series expansion: I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k + 1} / [k! (k + 1)!]. Maybe substituting the series into the integral and integrating term by term?

Let me try that. Let's express I₁(√[4]{x(1 - x)}) as a series. Let’s denote z = √[4]{x(1 - x)} = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}. Then, the series expansion for I₁(z) is:

I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (z/2)^{2k + 1} ] / [k! (k + 1)! ]

Substituting z = [x(1 - x)]^{1/4}, we get:

I₁([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ ([x(1 - x)]^{1/4}/2)^{2k + 1} ] / [k! (k + 1)! ]

Simplify the exponent: (1/4)(2k + 1) = (2k + 1)/4. So:

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 - x)]^{(2k + 1)/4} / [2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ]

Therefore, the integrand becomes:

x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} * Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 - x)]^{(2k + 1)/4} / [2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ]

Let me combine the exponents. For x terms: -1/4 + (2k + 1)/4 = (-1 + 2k + 1)/4 = (2k)/4 = k/2

For (1 - x) terms: 1/4 + (2k + 1)/4 = (1 + 2k + 1)/4 = (2k + 2)/4 = (k + 1)/2

So the integrand simplifies term-wise to:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} / [2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! )] ∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} dx

Now, the integral inside is the Beta function B(k/2 + 1, (k + 1)/2 + 1) = B((k + 2)/2, (k + 3)/2)

Recall that B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So:

Γ((k + 2)/2) Γ((k + 3)/2) / Γ((k + 2)/2 + (k + 3)/2) = Γ((k + 2)/2) Γ((k + 3)/2) / Γ((2k + 5)/2)

But Γ((k + 2)/2) and Γ((k + 3)/2) can be expressed using the duplication formula or properties of the Gamma function. Let's see:

If k is even, say k = 2n, then (k + 2)/2 = n + 1, and (k + 3)/2 = n + 1.5. If k is odd, say k = 2n + 1, then (k + 2)/2 = n + 1.5, and (k + 3)/2 = n + 2. But since k is summed over all integers, maybe we can use the property Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z). Let me check that.

Yes, the duplication formula is Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z). Let's apply this to Γ((k + 2)/2) and Γ((k + 3)/2). Let’s set z = (k + 2)/2. Then z + 1/2 = (k + 2)/2 + 1/2 = (k + 3)/2. So Γ(z)Γ(z + 1/2) = Γ((k + 2)/2)Γ((k + 3)/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z) = 2^{1 - (k + 2)} √π Γ(k + 2) = 2^{-k -1} √π Γ(k + 2)

Therefore, Γ((k + 2)/2)Γ((k + 3)/2) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! 

Because Γ(k + 2) = (k + 1)!.

So substituting back into the Beta function:

B((k + 2)/2, (k + 3)/2) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / Γ((2k + 5)/2)

But Γ((2k + 5)/2) can be written as Γ(k + 5/2). Let's express Γ(k + 5/2) in terms of factorials. Using the property Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! √π / (4^n n!) for integer n. But here, k is an integer, so k + 5/2 = (2k + 5)/2. Let's set m = k + 2, then Γ(m + 1/2) = (2m)! √π / (4^m m!). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me recall:

Γ(n + 1/2) = (2n)! / (4^n n!) ) √π for integer n ≥ 0.

So here, Γ(k + 5/2) = Γ( (k + 2) + 1/2 ) = (2(k + 2))! / (4^{k + 2} (k + 2)! )) √π

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express Γ(k + 5/2) in terms of Γ(1/2) and the Pochhammer symbols. Alternatively, let's see:

Γ(k + 5/2) = (k + 3/2)(k + 1/2)...(1/2) Γ(1/2)

But this might not be helpful. Let me see if there's a way to relate Γ(k + 5/2) to factorials. For example, Γ(k + 5/2) = (k + 3/2) Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 3/2)(k + 1/2) Γ(k + 1/2), and so on. But this seems messy.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Beta function result in terms of factorials. Wait, the Beta function B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b). So in our case, the integral ∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 - x)^{(k + 1)/2} dx = B(k/2 + 1, (k + 1)/2 + 1) = B((k + 2)/2, (k + 3)/2). And we have Γ((k + 2)/2)Γ((k + 3)/2) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! as per the duplication formula. Then Γ((2k + 5)/2) is Γ(a + b) where a = (k + 2)/2 and b = (k + 3)/2, so a + b = (2k + 5)/2. Therefore, the Beta function becomes [2^{-k -1} √π (k + 1)! ] / Γ((2k + 5)/2)

But I need to express Γ((2k + 5)/2). Let's write (2k + 5)/2 = k + 5/2. So Γ(k + 5/2). Using the identity Γ(k + 5/2) = (k + 3/2)(k + 1/2)...(1/2)√π. For example, for k=0: Γ(5/2) = (3/2)(1/2)√π = (3/4)√π. For k=1: Γ(7/2) = (5/2)(3/2)(1/2)√π = (15/8)√π. In general, Γ(k + 5/2) = √π / 2^{k + 2} } (2k + 3)!! where (2k + 3)!! is the double factorial. Alternatively, using the relation between double factorial and regular factorial: (2k + 3)!! = (2k + 3)! / (2^k (k + 1)! )

Wait, let's verify for k=0: (2*0 +3)!! =3!!=3*1=3, and (2k +3)! =3! =6, 2^0 (0 +1)! =1*1=1, so 6/1=6, which is not 3. Hmm, maybe another relation. The double factorial (2n)!! = 2^n n! and (2n +1)!! = (2n +1)! / (2^n n! ). So for (2k +3)!!, let n = k +1. Then (2(k +1) +1)!! = (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)(2k +1)...5*3*1. Which can be written as (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )

Yes, because (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)...2*1. If we separate the even and odd terms: (2k +3)(2k +1)...3*1 * (2k +2)(2k)...2*1. The first part is (2k +3)!! and the second part is 2^{k +1} (k +1)! So (2k +3)! = (2k +3)!! * 2^{k +1} (k +1)! ). Therefore, (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )

Therefore, Γ(k +5/2) = √π (2k +3)!! / 2^{k +2} } = √π ( (2k +3)! / (2^{k +1} (k +1)! )) ) / 2^{k +2} } = √π (2k +3)! / (2^{2k +3} (k +1)! ))

But let's substitute this back into the Beta function:

B((k +2)/2, (k +3)/2) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / [ √π (2k +3)! / (2^{2k +3} (k +1)! )) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! 

Denominator: √π (2k +3)! / (2^{2k +3} (k +1)! )) 

So the denominator becomes [√π (2k +3)! ] / [2^{2k +3} (k +1)! )]

Therefore, the entire expression is:

[2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] * [2^{2k +3} (k +1)! ) / (√π (2k +3)! ) ]

Simplify:

The √π cancels out. The 2^{-k -1} * 2^{2k +3} = 2^{( -k -1 + 2k +3 )} = 2^{k +2}

The (k +1)! * (k +1)! = (k +1)!²

So overall:

2^{k +2} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the Beta function is 2^{k +2} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral over x becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! )] * [2^{k +2} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! ) ]

Simplify the coefficients:

2^{k +2} / 2^{2k +1} = 2^{(k +2 -2k -1)} = 2^{(-k +1)} = 2^{1 -k}

The (k +1)!² / (k! (k +1)! )) = (k +1)/k! * (k +1)! / (k! (k +1)! )) Hmm, wait:

Wait, the denominator in the first term is 2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ), and the Beta function term has (k +1)!². So when we multiply, we have (k +1)!² / [k! (k +1)! )] = (k +1)/k! * (k +1)! / (k +1)! )? Wait, no:

Wait, (k +1)!² / [k! (k +1)! )] = (k +1)! / k! = (k +1). Because (k +1)! = (k +1)k!.

Yes, so (k +1)!² / [k! (k +1)! )] = (k +1)! / k! = k +1.

Therefore, combining all terms:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

Hmm, this seems like a manageable series. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for this sum.

Let’s make a substitution to simplify the index. Let’s set n = k +1. Then when k=0, n=1, and the sum becomes:

Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{1 - (n -1)} n ] / (2(n -1) +3)! ) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{2 -n} n ] / (2n +1)! )

Wait, 2^{1 - (n -1)} = 2^{2 -n}, and 2(n -1) +3 = 2n -2 +3 = 2n +1. So the sum is Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{2 -n} n ] / (2n +1)! )

But this still doesn't look familiar. Maybe another substitution. Let’s consider writing 2n +1 as m. Let m = 2n +1, so n = (m -1)/2. But m must be odd integers starting from 3 (when n=1, m=3). But this might not help. Alternatively, perhaps express the series in terms of known functions.

Alternatively, consider that the series resembles terms of sinh or cosh functions, which have series expansions involving (2n)! in the denominator. Let me recall:

sinh(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n +1}/(2n +1)! )

cosh(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n}/(2n)! )

But our series has (2n +1)! in the denominator and coefficients involving 2^{2 -n} n. Hmm. Let's see:

Let’s write the sum as Σ_{n=1}^∞ n 2^{2 -n} / (2n +1)! )

Let’s factor out 2^2 =4:

4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ n 2^{-n} / (2n +1)! )

So 4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^{n} (2n +1)! ) )

Hmm. Let’s see if this can be related to a known series. Let’s consider generating functions. Suppose we have a function f(z) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ z^{2n +1}/(2n +1)! ), which is sinh(z). But we need terms with n/(2n +1)! and 2^{-n}.

Alternatively, consider differentiating sinh(z) or other functions. Let’s think:

Let’s define S = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n 2^{-n} / (2n +1)! )

We can write this as Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s consider the generating function Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n +1}/(2n +1)! ) = sinh(x). But we need to relate this to our sum. Let’s see:

If we take the derivative of sinh(x), we get cosh(x). But perhaps integrating or differentiating term by term.

Alternatively, consider multiplying by x and integrating. Let’s see:

Let’s suppose we have a generating function G(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n +1}/(2n +1)! ) = sinh(x). Then, if we take the derivative with respect to x, G’(x) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (2n +1)x^{2n}/(2n +1)! ) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n}/(2n)! ) = cosh(x). Not helpful directly.

Alternatively, consider integrating G(x):

∫ G(x) dx = Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n +2}/[(2n +2)(2n +1)! ) ] = Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{2n +2}/[(2n +2)! ) ] * (2n +2) )

Wait, this might not help. Let’s think differently.

Let’s consider the sum S = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s make a substitution m = n. Then S = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! )

Let’s write 2m +1 = k, so m = (k -1)/2. But k must be odd integers starting from 3. So S = Σ_{k=3,5,7,...} ( (k -1)/2 ) / (2^{(k -1)/2} k! )

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps express the sum in terms of hypergeometric functions. The presence of factorial terms suggests that it might be expressible as a hypergeometric series.

Recall that a hypergeometric series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k * z^k /k! )

But in our case, the terms involve n / (2^n (2n +1)! ). Let’s see:

Let’s write the term as n / (2^n (2n +1)! ) = n / [2^n (2n +1)(2n)(2n -1)! ) ] = n / [2^n (2n +1)(2n)(2n -1)! ) ] = 1 / [2^{n +1} (2n +1)(2n -1)! ) ]

But this might not help. Alternatively, let's write (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)(2n -1)! )

But I'm not sure. Let’s try to express the term in terms of factorials. Let’s note that (2n +1)! = (2n +1)(2n)(2n -1)...3*2*1. But I don't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, consider the series S = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s write this as Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! ) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s try to relate this to the series expansion of e^{√2} or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider that 2n +1 can be written as (n +1) + n, but not sure.

Alternatively, consider generating functions for modified Bessel functions. For example, I know that I_ν(z) has a series involving terms z^{ν + 2k} / [k! Γ(ν +k +1) 2^{ν + 2k} }.

Wait, for example, I₁(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z/2)^{2k +1} / [k! (k +1)! ]

But our sum S is different. Let’s see:

If we set z = something, can we relate S to I₁(z)?

Alternatively, let's consider the sum S multiplied by some power of 2. Let’s see:

S = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s factor out 1/2:

S = (1/2) Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^{n -1} (2n +1)! )

But 2^{n -1} = 2^{n}/2, so this is the same as before.

Alternatively, let’s shift the index. Let’s set m = n -1. Then when n=1, m=0:

S = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (m +1) / (2^{m +1} (2m +3)! )

= (1/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ (m +1) / (2^m (2m +3)! )

Still not obvious.

Alternatively, consider writing (2m +3)! = (2m +3)(2m +2)(2m +1)! )

So S = (1/2) Σ_{m=0}^∞ (m +1) / [2^m (2m +3)(2m +2)(2m +1)! ) ]

But this seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use the integral representation of 1/(2m +3)! ). Recall that 1/(2m +3)! ) = ∫₀^1 t^{2m +2} e^{-t} dt / (2m +2)! ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the series might telescope or relate to a known function when summed.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.

Let’s compute the first few terms of S:

For n=1: 1 / (2^1 (3)! ) = 1/(2*6) = 1/12 ≈0.0833333333

n=2: 2 / (2^2 (5)! ) = 2/(4*120) = 2/480 = 1/240 ≈0.0041666667

n=3: 3 / (2^3 (7)! ) = 3/(8*5040) = 3/40320 ≈0.00007440476

n=4:4 / (2^4 (9)! )=4/(16*362880)=4/5806080≈0.000000689

So the terms are decreasing rapidly. So the sum S is approximately 0.083333333 +0.0041666667 +0.00007440476 +0.000000689 ≈0.087574093

Then multiply by 4 (from earlier step): 4 *0.087574093 ≈0.35029637

But this is just a rough approximation. However, the original integral is equal to this sum S multiplied by 4. So if S ≈0.087574093, then the integral is ≈0.35029637. But this is a rough estimate. However, the problem asks for an exact analytical solution and a numerical approximation to 10 decimal places. So perhaps there's an exact expression involving known constants.

Wait, but maybe there's a better approach to the original integral. Let me think again.

The original integral is ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} I₁( [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} ) dx

Let’s make a substitution to simplify the argument of the Bessel function. Let’s set t = [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}. Then t^4 = x(1 -x). But solving for x in terms of t might be complicated. Alternatively, use a trigonometric substitution. Let’s set x = sin²θ. Then 1 -x = cos²θ, and x(1 -x) = sin²θ cos²θ = (sinθ cosθ)^2 = (sin2θ / 2)^2. So [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} = (sin2θ / 2)^{1/2} = sin2θ / √2. But this might not help directly. Let’s see:

If x = sin²θ, then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. The limits when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2.

Substituting into the integral:

∫₀^{π/2} [sin²θ]^{-1/4} [cos²θ]^{1/4} I₁( [sin²θ cos²θ]^{1/4} ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the terms:

[sin²θ]^{-1/4} = sin^{-1/2}θ

[cos²θ]^{1/4} = cos^{1/2}θ

So the integrand becomes:

sin^{-1/2}θ * cos^{1/2}θ * I₁( [sin²θ cos²θ]^{1/4} ) * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the exponents:

sin^{-1/2}θ * sinθ = sin^{1/2}θ

cos^{1/2}θ * cosθ = cos^{3/2}θ

So the integrand is:

2 sin^{1/2}θ cos^{3/2}θ I₁( [sinθ cosθ]^{1/2} ) dθ

But [sinθ cosθ]^{1/2} = (sin2θ / 2)^{1/2} = (sin2θ)^{1/2} / 2^{1/2}

So the argument of I₁ is (sin2θ)^{1/2} / √2

Let’s denote z = (sin2θ)^{1/2} / √2. Then z = [sin2θ]^{1/2} / √2 = [sin2θ]^{1/2} 2^{-1/2} = [sin2θ / 2]^{1/2}

But I'm not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps express I₁ in terms of its series expansion here.

Alternatively, consider another substitution. Let’s set φ = 2θ, so when θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. Then dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes:

2 ∫₀^{π} sin^{1/2}(φ/2) cos^{3/2}(φ/2) I₁( [sin(φ)/2]^{1/2} ) * (dφ/2)

Simplify:

= ∫₀^{π} sin^{1/2}(φ/2) cos^{3/2}(φ/2) I₁( [sinφ/2]^{1/2} ) dφ

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the substitution t = sinφ, but this might not help.

Alternatively, recall that integrals involving Bessel functions and trigonometric functions can sometimes be evaluated using integral tables or known identities.

Alternatively, consider that the original integral might be expressible in terms of the Beta function multiplied by some hypergeometric function. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the series approach, we have the integral = 4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Let’s compute this sum numerically to high precision. Let's compute several terms:

Term n=1: 1/(2^1 * 3! ) = 1/(2*6) = 1/12 ≈0.08333333333333333

n=2: 2/(2^2 *5! ) =2/(4*120)=2/480=1/240≈0.004166666666666667

n=3:3/(2^3 *7! )=3/(8*5040)=3/40320≈0.0000744047619047619

n=4:4/(2^4 *9! )=4/(16*362880)=4/5806080≈0.0000006893004115226337

n=5:5/(2^5 *11! )=5/(32*39916800)=5/1277337600≈0.000000003914989357543

n=6:6/(2^6 *13! )=6/(64*6227020800)=6/398529331200≈1.5060025e-11

Adding these terms:

0.08333333333333333 +0.004166666666666667 =0.0875

+0.0000744047619047619 =0.08757440476190476

+0.0000006893004115226337 =0.08757509406231628

+0.000000003914989357543 =0.08757509797730564

+1.5060025e-11 ≈0.0875750979773207

So after n=6, the terms are negligible. So the sum S ≈0.0875750979773207

Then the integral is 4 * S ≈0.3503003919092828

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 0.3503003919

But let's check with higher precision. Let's compute more terms:

n=7:7/(2^7 *15! )=7/(128*1307674368000)=7/167423319014400≈4.1805e-14

n=8:8/(2^8 *17! )=8/(256*355687428096000)=8/910554817536000≈8.787e-18

So these terms are negligible. Therefore, the sum S is approximately 0.0875750979773207 +4.18e-14 +8.78e-18 ≈0.0875750979773207

Thus, the integral is 4 * 0.0875750979773207 ≈0.3503003919092828

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.3503003919

But let's verify this with another approach. Perhaps using numerical integration.

Alternatively, since the integral is from 0 to1, and the integrand is x^{-1/4}(1 -x)^{1/4}I₁([x(1 -x)]^{1/4}), we can use numerical methods to approximate it. However, since the singularities at 0 and 1 are integrable, adaptive quadrature should handle it.

But since I'm doing this manually, I'll rely on the series approach. Given that the series converges rapidly and the terms beyond n=6 are negligible, the approximation 0.3503003919 seems reasonable.

But wait, let's check with another method. Let's recall that the modified Bessel function I₁(z) can be expressed as:

I₁(z) = (z/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ (z^2/4)^k / (k! (k +1)! )

So substituting z = [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}, we have:

I₁([x(1 -x)]^{1/4}) = ([x(1 -x)]^{1/4}/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ ([x(1 -x)]^{1/2}/4)^k / (k! (k +1)! )

Then the integrand becomes:

x^{-1/4}(1 -x)^{1/4} * [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}/2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ ([x(1 -x)]^{1/2}/4)^k / (k! (k +1)! )

Simplify:

= (1/2) x^{-1/4 +1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4 +1/4} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! )

= (1/2) (1 -x)^{1/2} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! )

Wait, this seems different from the previous approach. Let me check:

Wait, x^{-1/4} * [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} = x^{-1/4} x^{1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} = (1 -x)^{1/4}

Similarly, (1 -x)^{1/4} * [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} = (1 -x)^{1/4} x^{1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} = x^{1/4} (1 -x)^{1/2}

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying.

Wait, original integrand after substitution:

x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} * I₁([x(1 -x)]^{1/4})

Then I₁([x(1 -x)]^{1/4}) = ([x(1 -x)]^{1/4}/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ ([x(1 -x)]^{1/2}/4)^k / (k! (k +1)! )

So multiplying by x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} gives:

x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} * [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}/2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! )

= (1/2) x^{-1/4 +1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4 +1/4} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! )

= (1/2) (1 -x)^{1/2} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! )

Hmm, this seems different from the previous series expansion. Wait, but this might be another way to express the integrand. However, integrating this from 0 to1:

Integral = (1/2) ∫₀¹ (1 -x)^{1/2} Σ_{k=0}^∞ [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} / (4^k k! (k +1)! ) dx

= (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(4^k k! (k +1)! )] ∫₀¹ (1 -x)^{1/2} [x(1 -x)]^{k/2} dx

= (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(4^k k! (k +1)! )] ∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 -x)^{k/2 +1/2} dx

Which is similar to the previous approach. The integral inside is Beta(k/2 +1, k/2 + 3/2)

Which is Γ(k/2 +1)Γ(k/2 +3/2)/Γ(k + 5/2)

Using the duplication formula again:

Γ(k/2 +1)Γ(k/2 +3/2) = 2^{1 - (k +1)} √π Γ(k +2)

Wait, let's verify:

Set z = k/2 +1. Then Γ(z)Γ(z +1/2) = Γ(k/2 +1)Γ(k/2 +3/2) = 2^{1 - 2z} √π Γ(2z)

Here, 2z = k +2, so:

Γ(k/2 +1)Γ(k/2 +3/2) = 2^{1 - (k +2)} √π Γ(k +2) = 2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! 

Therefore, the Beta function becomes:

Γ(k/2 +1)Γ(k/2 +3/2)/Γ(k +5/2) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / Γ(k +5/2)

As before, Γ(k +5/2) can be expressed using the duplication formula or factorial relations. As before, Γ(k +5/2) = √π (2k +4)! / (4^{k +2} (k +2)! ) )

Wait, no. Let's use the relation for Γ(n +1/2):

Γ(k +5/2) = (k +3/2)(k +1/2)...(1/2)√π

But for integer k, this can be written as:

Γ(k +5/2) = ( (2k +3)!! ) √π / 2^{k +2}

But (2k +3)!! = (2k +3)(2k +1)...5*3*1

Alternatively, using the relation between double factorial and regular factorial:

(2k +3)!! = (2k +3)! / (2^k (k +1)! )

Therefore, Γ(k +5/2) = ( (2k +3)! / (2^k (k +1)! ) ) √π / 2^{k +2} = (2k +3)! √π / (2^{2k +2} (k +1)! ) )

Therefore, substituting back into the Beta function:

[2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / [ (2k +3)! √π / (2^{2k +2} (k +1)! ) ) ]

Simplify:

= [2^{-k -1} (k +1)! ] * [2^{2k +2} (k +1)! ) / (2k +3)! ) ]

= 2^{2k +2 -k -1} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

= 2^{k +1} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(4^k k! (k +1)! )] * [2^{k +1} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! ) ]

Simplify the coefficients:

2^{k +1} /4^k = 2^{k +1}/2^{2k} = 2^{-k +1} = 2^{1 -k}

The (k +1)!² / (k! (k +1)! )) = (k +1)/k! * (k +1)! / (k +1)! ) = (k +1)/k! *1 = (k +1)/k! 

Wait, no:

(k +1)!² / (k! (k +1)! )) = (k +1)! /k! = k +1

Yes, the same as before. Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

Which is the same series S as before multiplied by (1/2). Wait, no:

Wait, the integral is (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

But earlier, we had the integral equal to 4 * S, where S was Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

But here, the series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

Let’s shift the index k to m =k +1. When k=0, m=1:

Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2^{1 - (m -1)} m ] / (2(m -1) +3)! ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2^{2 -m} m ] / (2m +1)! )

Which is the same as 2^2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! ) ) =4 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! ) )

Therefore, the integral is (1/2) *4 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! ) ) =2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! ) )

But earlier, we had the integral equals 4 * S, where S was Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

But here, it's 2 * Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! )

Wait, this suggests a discrepancy. Wait, no, in the first approach, after substitution, we had the integral equal to 4 * S, where S was Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

But in this second approach, we have the integral equal to 2 * Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! )

This suggests a mistake in one of the derivations. Let me check.

In the first approach, after expanding I₁ as a series and substituting, we arrived at the integral being Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! ), which when shifting index to n=k+1 became Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{2 -n} n ] / (2n +1)! ), and then the integral was 4 * Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

In the second approach, after substituting the series expansion of I₁ and simplifying, we arrived at the integral being (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! ), which after shifting index becomes 2 * Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

This suggests a mistake in one of the derivations. Let me check the first approach:

First approach steps:

1. Expanded I₁(z) as a series.

2. Combined terms to get the integrand as a series.

3. Integrated term by term, resulting in a sum involving Beta functions.

4. Applied duplication formula to express Beta function in terms of Gamma functions.

5. Simplified to get the integral as Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

6. Shifted index to n=k+1, leading to Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{2 -n} n ] / (2n +1)! )

7. Factored out 4 to get 4 * Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

Second approach steps:

1. Expanded I₁(z) as a series.

2. Integrated term by term, leading to (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3! )

3. Shifted index to m=k+1, leading to 2 * Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! )

The discrepancy is a factor of 2. This suggests that there was an error in one of the steps.

Looking back at the first approach:

After substituting the series expansion of I₁, the integrand became:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{k/2} (1 -x)^{(k +1)/2} / [2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ]

Then the integral became Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! )] ∫₀¹ x^{k/2} (1 -x)^{(k +1)/2} dx

Then the integral inside was evaluated as B((k +2)/2, (k +3)/2) = [2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / Γ(k +5/2 )

Then after substituting Γ(k +5/2) and simplifying, the integral became:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3)! )

Then shifting index to n=k+1, we get Σ_{n=1}^∞ [2^{2 -n} n ] / (2n +1)! )

Which is 4 * Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

In the second approach, after expanding I₁ and simplifying, the integral became:

(1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3! )

Shifting index to m=k+1 gives:

(1/2) * Σ_{m=1}^∞ [2^{2 -m} m ] / (2m +1! )

Which is (1/2) * 4 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! ) ) = 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^m (2m +1)! )

This suggests that the first approach had an extra factor of 2. Let me check where the mistake could be.

In the first approach, after substituting the series expansion, the integrand was:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ x^{k/2} (1 -x)^{(k +1)/2} / [2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ]

Then the integral became Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1 / (2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! )] * B((k +2)/2, (k +3)/2 )

Then using the duplication formula, the Beta function was expressed as [2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / Γ(k +5/2 )

Then Γ(k +5/2) was expressed as √π (2k +3)! / (2^{2k +3} (k +1)! )

Therefore, the Beta function becomes [2^{-k -1} √π (k +1)! ] / [ √π (2k +3)! / (2^{2k +3} (k +1)! ) ]

Simplifying:

= [2^{-k -1} (k +1)! ] * [2^{2k +3} (k +1)! ] / (2k +3)! )

= 2^{2k +3 -k -1} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

= 2^{k +2} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

[1 / (2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! )] * [2^{k +2} (k +1)!² / (2k +3)! ) ]

= [2^{k +2} / 2^{2k +1} ] * [ (k +1)!² / (k! (k +1)! ) ] * [1 / (2k +3)! ) ]

= 2^{ -k +1 } * (k +1)/k! * 1 / (2k +3)! )

= 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (k! (2k +3)! )

But k! (2k +3)! is the denominator. Wait, no:

Wait, the denominator is 2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ), and the numerator from the Beta function is 2^{k +2} (k +1)!². So:

[2^{k +2} (k +1)!² ] / [2^{2k +1} k! (k +1)! ) (2k +3)! ) ]

= [2^{k +2} (k +1)! ] / [2^{2k +1} k! (2k +3)! ) ]

= 2^{k +2 -2k -1} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

= 2^{ -k +1 } (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral term is 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

Therefore, the integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

Which is the same as in the second approach. Therefore, the integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

But when we shift the index k to n =k +1, we get:

Σ_{n=1}^∞ 2^{1 - (n -1)} n / (2(n -1) +3)! ) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 2^{2 -n} n / (2n +1)! )

Which is 4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1)! )

But in the second approach, after substituting, we arrived at the integral being (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3! ), which is the same as Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! ), which is the same as the first approach. Therefore, the integral is indeed Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! )

But when expressed as 4 Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1! ), which is the same as 4S, where S is Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1! )

But in the second approach, after substituting, we had the integral = (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2^{1 -k} (k +1) ] / (2k +3! ), which is the same as the first approach. Therefore, there's no discrepancy. The integral is Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! ), which is equal to 4S where S is Σ_{n=1}^∞ n / (2^n (2n +1! )

Therefore, the integral is 4 * S ≈4 *0.0875750979773207≈0.3503003919

Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! ), but perhaps this can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions. However, I'm not aware of a closed-form expression for this series. Therefore, the exact answer is left as the series, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.3503003919.

But the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer. If there's no known closed-form, then perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let’s see:

The series Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

Let’s write this as 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3)! )

Let’s consider the general term: (k +1)/(2^k (2k +3)! )

This can be expressed as a hypergeometric function. Let’s recall that hypergeometric functions are defined as:

_pF_q(a_1,...,a_p; b_1,...,b_q; z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [(a_1)_k ... (a_p)_k / (b_1)_k ... (b_q)_k] z^k /k! )

But our term has (k +1) in the numerator and (2k +3)! in the denominator. Let’s see:

(k +1) = (k +1) = (1)_k (1) / (1)_k ?

Alternatively, note that (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)...(k +4)(k +3)! )

But this might not help. Alternatively, express (2k +3)! = 2^{2k +3} (k + 1.5)_k (k +3)! )

Not sure. Alternatively, consider that (2k +3)! = Γ(2k +4) = (2k +3)(2k +2)...(1)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, write the term as:

(k +1)/(2^k (2k +3)! ) = (k +1)/(2^k (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)! )

= (k +1)/(2^k (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)! )

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, consider that (2k +3)! = (2k +3)(2k +2)(2k +1)(2k)! )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express the term in terms of the Pochhammer symbols.

Alternatively, consider that the series can be written as:

2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^k (2k +3)! ) = 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^k (2k +3)! )

Let’s write this as 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) z^k / (2k +3)! ) with z=1/2

But I don't know a standard function with this series. Alternatively, differentiate or integrate a known series.

Let’s consider the function f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! ) = sinh(z) - z - z^3/6

But not helpful. Alternatively, consider integrating f(z):

If f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! ), then f'(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +2} / (2k +2)! )

But this is similar to sinh(z) or cosh(z). However, relating this to our series is not straightforward.

Alternatively, consider multiplying by z and differentiating:

Let’s define f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! )

Then z f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ z^{2k +4} / (2k +3)! )

Differentiating z f(z):

d/dz [z f(z)] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +4) z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +4) z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! )

= 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +2) z^{2k +3} / (2k +3)! )

But our series involves (k +1)/ (2k +3)! ) times z^k. Not directly related.

Alternatively, perhaps use generating functions in terms of Bessel functions. For example, the modified Bessel function I_ν(z) has series involving terms z^{ν +2k} / (k! Γ(ν +k +1) 2^{ν +2k} )

But our series has terms (k +1)/ (2k +3)! ) z^k. Not matching.

Given that I can't find a closed-form expression for the series, and the problem requires an exact analytical answer, I might have missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of the Meijer G-function or other special functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can be made in the original integral to relate it to a known integral involving Bessel functions.

Let’s consider the original integral again:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} I₁( [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} ) dx

Let’s make the substitution t = x(1 -x). Then dt/dx =1 -2x. But this complicates the limits and the differential. Alternatively, use the substitution x = sin²θ as before.

But earlier attempts didn't yield a simplification. Alternatively, consider the substitution y = [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}, but solving for x in terms of y is complicated.

Alternatively, consider the integral representation of the Bessel function. For example, I₁(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{z cosθ} cosθ dθ. Substituting this into the integral:

∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} [ (1/π) ∫₀^π e^{ [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} cosθ } cosθ dθ ] dx

Interchange the order of integration:

(1/π) ∫₀^π cosθ [ ∫₀¹ x^{-1/4} (1 -x)^{1/4} e^{ [x(1 -x)]^{1/4} cosθ } dx ] dθ

But this seems more complicated. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, consider the argument of the Bessel function, [x(1 -x)]^{1/4}, and note that the maximum of x(1 -x) on [0,1] is 1/4 at x=1/2. So the argument of I₁ is at most (1/4)^{1/4} = (1/2)^{1/2} = 1/√2 ≈0.707. So the Bessel function is evaluated at relatively small arguments. But I'm not sure if this helps.

Given that I'm stuck on finding an exact analytical expression and the problem requires it, I might need to consult integral tables or research papers. However, assuming that I don't have access to those, I might have to conclude that the integral can be expressed as the series we derived, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution.

Wait, let's consider the substitution t = x^{1/4}. Let’s set t = x^{1/4}, so x = t^4, dx =4t^3 dt. Then when x=0, t=0; x=1, t=1. The integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (t^4)^{-1/4} (1 -t^4)^{1/4} I₁( [t^4(1 -t^4)]^{1/4} ) *4t^3 dt

Simplify:

= ∫₀¹ t^{-1} (1 -t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 -t^4)^{1/4} ) *4t^3 dt

=4 ∫₀¹ t^{2} (1 -t^4)^{1/4} I₁( t (1 -t^4)^{1/4} ) dt

Not sure if this helps. Alternatively, set u = t^4, but that brings us back.

Alternatively, set z = t (1 -t^4)^{1/4}, but this might not help.

Alternatively, consider expanding I₁ in a power series and integrating term by term, which is what we did earlier.

Given that I can't find a closed-form expression and the problem requires an exact answer, I might have to accept that the exact answer is expressed as the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! ), but perhaps this can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions.

Let’s try to express the series as a hypergeometric function. The general term is:

2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3)! )

Let’s write this as 2 * (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3)! )

Let’s consider the series:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) z^k / (2k +3)! )

We can write this as Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) z^k / (2k +3)! )

Let’s shift the index by letting m =k +1. Then k =m -1:

Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1} / (2m +1)! )

= z^{-1} Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m} / (2m +1)! )

But this doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, consider that (k +1) = (k +1) and (2k +3)! = (2(k +1) +1)!.

Let’s set m =k +1. Then:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) z^k / (2k +3)! ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1} / (2m +1)! )

= z^{-1} Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m} / (2m +1)! )

But this is not a standard hypergeometric series. However, note that Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m} / (2m +1)! ) = sinh(√z)/√z

But our series has an extra factor of m. Let’s differentiate the series Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m} / (2m +1)! ) with respect to z:

d/dz Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m} / (2m +1)! ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1} / (2m +1)! )

Which is exactly the series we have. Therefore:

Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1} / (2m +1! ) = d/dz [ Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m} / (2m +1! ) ] = d/dz [ sinh(√z)/√z ]

Therefore, sinh(√z)/√z = Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m} / (2m +1)! )

Differentiating this with respect to z:

d/dz [ sinh(√z)/√z ] = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z)/(2z^{3/2}) ] 

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

Let f(z) = sinh(√z)/√z

Then f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z)/(2z^{3/2}) * z ] 

Wait, using the quotient rule:

f(z) = sinh(√z) / √z

f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{3/2})) ] 

Simplify:

= [ cosh(√z) / 2 - sinh(√z) / (2 z^{3/2}) ]

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, compute the derivative:

f(z) = sinh(√z)/√z

Let’s set t = √z, so z = t², dz = 2t dt

Then f(z) = sinh(t)/t

df/dz = df/dt * dt/dz = [ (cosh(t) t - sinh(t))/t² ] * (1/(2t)) 

= [ (cosh(t) t - sinh(t)) / t² ] * (1/(2t)) 

= (cosh(t) t - sinh(t)) / (2t^3 )

Expressed in terms of z:

= (cosh(√z) √z - sinh(√z)) / (2 z^{3/2} )

Therefore, the derivative is:

[cosh(√z) √z - sinh(√z)] / (2 z^{3/2} )

Therefore, the series Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1} / (2m +1! ) = [cosh(√z) √z - sinh(√z)] / (2 z^{3/2} )

Therefore, our original series with z=1/2 is:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3)! ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m (1/2)^{m -1} / (2m +1! ) = 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m (1/2)^{m / (2m +1! )

But wait, our series is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3)! ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^{m -1} (2m +1! ) )

= 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m / (2^{m} (2m +1! ) )

Which is 2 times the derivative series evaluated at z=1/2:

= 2 * [cosh(√(1/2)) √(1/2) - sinh(√(1/2)) ] / (2 (1/2)^{3/2} )

Simplify:

First, compute √(1/2) = 1/√2

cosh(1/√2) * (1/√2) - sinh(1/√2)

Denominator: 2 * (1/2)^{3/2} = 2 * (1/(2√2)) )= 1/√2

Therefore, the expression becomes:

2 * [cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2) ] / (1/√2) )

= 2 * [ cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2) ] * √2

= 2 * [ cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 ]

Wait, let's compute step by step:

Numerator: cosh(1/√2) * (1/√2) - sinh(1/√2)

Denominator: 1/√2

So the entire expression is:

[cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2) ] / (1/√2) = cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2

Wait, let's compute:

[cosh(a)/a - sinh(a)] / (1/a) where a=1/√2

= [cosh(a)/a - sinh(a)] * a = cosh(a) - a sinh(a)

So with a=1/√2:

= cosh(1/√2) - (1/√2) sinh(1/√2)

Therefore, the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3! ) ) = 2 * [ cosh(1/√2) - (1/√2) sinh(1/√2) ] / (1/√2 )

Wait, no, earlier steps:

We had:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3! ) ) = 2 * [cosh(√z) √z - sinh(√z)] / (2 z^{3/2} ) evaluated at z=1/2

But z=1/2, so:

= 2 * [cosh(√(1/2)) * √(1/2) - sinh(√(1/2)) ] / (2 * (1/2)^{3/2} )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 * [cosh(1/√2) * (1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) ]

Denominator: 2 * (1/2)^{3/2} = 2 * (1/(2√2)) )= 1/√2

So the entire expression is:

[2 * (cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2)) ] / (1/√2) = 2 * [cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2) ] * √2

= 2 * [ cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 * (1/√2) ]

Wait, no:

Wait, [cosh(1/√2)/√2 - sinh(1/√2) ] * √2 = cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2

Therefore, the entire expression is 2 * [ cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 ]

But this seems complicated. Let's compute it numerically:

Compute cosh(1/√2) and sinh(1/√2):

1/√2 ≈0.7071067812

cosh(0.7071067812) ≈1.260591836

sinh(0.7071067812) ≈0.7670066493

Then:

cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 ≈1.260591836 -0.7670066493 *1.414213562 ≈1.260591836 -1.085141586 ≈0.17545025

Multiply by 2: 0.3509005

This is close to our earlier approximation of 0.3503003919. The discrepancy suggests a mistake in the derivation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, the series Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3! ) ) is equal to 2 * [cosh(√z) √z - sinh(√z)] / (2 z^{3/2} ) evaluated at z=1/2.

But when we substitute z=1/2:

Numerator: cosh(√(1/2)) * √(1/2) - sinh(√(1/2)) 

Denominator: 2 * (1/2)^{3/2} = 2 * (1/(2√2)) )= 1/√2

So the expression is:

[cosh(1/√2) * (1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) ] / (1/√2) 

= [cosh(1/√2) * (1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) ] * √2 

= cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 

Then multiply by 2 (from the earlier factor):

2 * [cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2) * √2 ]

But according to the numerical calculation, this gives approximately 2*(1.260591836 -0.7670066493*1.414213562) ≈2*(1.260591836 -1.085141586)≈2*0.17545025≈0.3509005

But our series summation gave approximately 0.3503003919. There's a discrepancy here, which indicates an error in the derivation.

Let me check the differentiation step again. The series Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^{m}/(2m +1)! ) = sinh(√z)/√z. Then the derivative is Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1}/(2m +1)! ) = d/dz [sinh(√z)/√z]

But when we computed this derivative, we got [cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z)/(2 z^{3/2}) ] which simplifies to [cosh(√z)/2 - sinh(√z)/(2 z^{3/2}) ]

But this seems incorrect. Let's recompute the derivative:

f(z) = sinh(√z)/√z

Let’s compute f'(z):

f'(z) = [cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{3/2})) ] 

Wait, using the quotient rule:

f(z) = sinh(√z) / √z

f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{3/2})) ] 

Wait, no. The derivative of sinh(√z) is cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)), and the derivative of 1/√z is -1/(2 z^{3/2}).

So using the quotient rule:

f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (-1/(2 z^{3/2})) ] / z

Wait, no, the quotient rule is (num’ * den - num * den’)/den²

Here, numerator = sinh(√z), denominator = √z

So f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{1/2})) ] / z

Wait, no:

Wait, denominator is √z = z^{1/2}, so den’ = (1/2) z^{-1/2}

Therefore:

f'(z) = [ cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * z^{1/2} - sinh(√z) * (1/2) z^{-1/2} ] / z^{1/2} )

Simplify:

= [ cosh(√z) * (1/2) - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{1/2})) ] / z^{1/2}

= [ cosh(√z) / 2 - sinh(√z) / (2 z^{1/2}) ] / z^{1/2}

= [ cosh(√z) / (2 z^{1/2}) - sinh(√z) / (2 z) ]

But this seems different from before. Let's compute this correctly:

f(z) = sinh(√z)/√z

f'(z) = [cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * √z - sinh(√z) * (1/(2 z^{3/2})) ] 

Wait, no. Let's use the product rule instead. Let’s write f(z) = sinh(√z) * z^{-1/2}

Then f'(z) = cosh(√z) * (1/(2√z)) * z^{-1/2} + sinh(√z) * (-1/2) z^{-3/2}

= cosh(√z) / (2 z) - sinh(√z) / (2 z^{3/2} )

Therefore, f'(z) = [cosh(√z) / (2 z) - sinh(√z) / (2 z^{3/2} ) ]

Therefore, the derivative is:

[cosh(√z) - sinh(√z)/√z ] / (2 z )

Therefore, the series Σ_{m=1}^∞ m z^{m -1}/(2m +1)! ) = [cosh(√z) - sinh(√z)/√z ] / (2 z )

Therefore, substituting z=1/2:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3! ) ) = Σ_{m=1}^∞ m (1/2)^{m -1}/(2m +1! ) = 2 Σ_{m=1}^∞ m (1/2)^{m}/(2m +1! )

= 2 * [cosh(√(1/2)) - sinh(√(1/2))/√(1/2) ] / (2 * (1/2) )

Simplify:

= 2 * [cosh(1/√2) - sinh(1/√2)/ (1/√2) ] / (1 )

= 2 * [cosh(1/√2) - √2 sinh(1/√2) ]

Now, numerically:

cosh(1/√2) ≈1.260591836

sinh(1/√2) ≈0.7670066493

√2 ≈1.414213562

So:

cosh(1/√2) - √2 sinh(1/√2) ≈1.260591836 -1.414213562*0.7670066493 ≈1.260591836 -1.085141586 ≈0.17545025

Multiply by 2: 0.3509005

This is approximately 0.3509005, which is close to our previous numerical approximation of 0.3503003919 but not the same. This discrepancy suggests an error in the analytical derivation. However, given that the series summation gave approximately 0.3503003919 and the hypergeometric approach gave 0.3509005, there must be a mistake in one of the steps.

Upon reviewing, I realize that when we expressed the series in terms of the hypergeometric function, we might have made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the series:

The original series after substitution was:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{1 -k} (k +1) / (2k +3! )

= 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) / (2^{k} (2k +3)! )

But when we related this to the derivative of sinh(√z)/√z, we set z=1/2 and found the series equals 2 * [cosh(1/√2) - √2 sinh(1/√2) ]

But according to the numerical evaluation, this gives approximately 0.3509005, while the direct summation of the series gives approximately 0.3503003919. This inconsistency indicates an error in the analytical approach.

However, given that the numerical approximation from the series summation is more reliable (since we summed several terms and the higher terms are negligible), the correct numerical answer is approximately 0.3503003919.

Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as 2 [cosh(√(1/2)) - √2 sinh(√(1/2)) ] but this evaluates to approximately 0.3509005, which conflicts with the series summation. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the analytical derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct exact answer is 2 [cosh(1/√2) - √2 sinh(1/√2) ], and the numerical approximation from the series was incorrect due to insufficient terms. Let's check with more terms.

Earlier, we summed up to n=6 and got approximately 0.0875750979773207 for S, leading to the integral as 4*S≈0.3503003919. However, if the analytical expression gives 0.3509005, perhaps we need to sum more terms.

Let’s compute more terms of the series S:

n=1: 1/12 ≈0.08333333333333333

n=2:1/240≈0.004166666666666667

n=3:3/40320≈0.0000744047619047619

n=4:4/5806080≈0.0000006893004115226337

n=5:5/1277337600≈0.000000003914989357543

n=6:6/398529331200≈1.5060025e-11

n=7:7/2.117542291e+12≈3.305e-12

n=8:8/2.433674e+14≈3.29e-14

Adding these:

0.08333333333333333 +0.004166666666666667 =0.0875

+0.0000744047619047619 =0.08757440476190476

+0.0000006893004115226337 =0.08757509406231628

+0.000000003914989357543 =0.08757509797730564

+1.5060025e-11 ≈0.0875750979773207

+3.305e-12 ≈0.087575097977324

+3.29e-14 ≈0.08757509797732403

So even with more terms, the sum S is approximately 0.08757509797732403, leading to the integral as 4*S≈0.3503003919092961

This is approximately 0.3503003919, which conflicts with the analytical result of 0.3509005. This suggests that there's a mistake in the analytical derivation. The most likely error is in the differentiation step or in the substitution.

Given the time I've spent and the requirement to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the numerical result obtained from the series summation, as it converges and the terms are rapidly decreasing. Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as the series, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.3503003919.

However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically. Given that I might have missed a step, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the series as the exact answer and the numerical approximation.
