Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is ∫₀¹ [x² / √(1 + x²)] * ln(x + √(1 + x²)) * arccos(x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify it by recognizing some patterns or substitutions.

First, let's note that ln(x + √(1 + x²)) is actually the inverse hyperbolic sine function, arsinh(x). Because arsinh(x) = ln(x + √(x² + 1)). So that term simplifies to arsinh(x). But I'm not sure if that helps immediately. Let me write that down: ln(x + √(1 + x²)) = arsinh(x). So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [x² / √(1 + x²)] * arsinh(x) * arccos(x) dx.

Now, the integrand has two inverse trigonometric functions multiplied together: arsinh(x) and arccos(x). That might be tricky. Maybe integration by parts could work here. Let's recall that integration by parts is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. We need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral is simpler.

But with two functions multiplied, arsinh(x) and arccos(x), perhaps we can consider one of them as part of u and the other as part of dv. Let's see. Let me denote:

Let’s set u = arsinh(x) * arccos(x), and dv = x² / √(1 + x²) dx. Then du would be the derivative of the product, which might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe split the product into two parts. Alternatively, perhaps first consider substitution.

Wait, another thought: the presence of arccos(x) suggests a substitution θ = arccos(x). Let’s try that. Let θ = arccos(x), so x = cosθ, and when x=0, θ=π/2, and x=1, θ=0. Then dx = -sinθ dθ. Let's substitute these into the integral.

So, substituting x = cosθ, dx = -sinθ dθ. The limits go from θ=π/2 to θ=0, so we can reverse them and remove the negative sign. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [cos²θ / √(1 + cos²θ)] * ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)) * θ * sinθ dθ.

Hmm, let's check the substitution step by step. The original integrand is x² / √(1 + x²) * ln(x + √(1 + x²)) * arccos(x). Substituting x = cosθ, so x² = cos²θ, √(1 + x²) becomes √(1 + cos²θ), ln(x + √(1 + x²)) becomes ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)), arccos(x) is θ, and dx is -sinθ dθ. So after substitution, the integral becomes:

∫_{π/2}^0} [cos²θ / √(1 + cos²θ)] * ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)) * θ * (-sinθ) dθ. Reversing the limits and removing the negative sign gives:

∫₀^{π/2} [cos²θ / √(1 + cos²θ)] * ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)) * θ * sinθ dθ.

Hmm, not sure if this is better. Let's see if we can simplify ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)). Wait, that's similar to the inverse hyperbolic sine function again. Let me check: arsinh(z) = ln(z + √(z² + 1)). If we take z = cosθ, then arsinh(cosθ) = ln(cosθ + √(cos²θ + 1)) = ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)). So that term is arsinh(cosθ). So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [cos²θ / √(1 + cos²θ)] * arsinh(cosθ) * θ * sinθ dθ.

Hmm, still complicated. Maybe there's a relationship between θ and arsinh(cosθ). Let's see. Since θ is in [0, π/2], cosθ is positive. Let me compute arsinh(cosθ). arsinh(cosθ) = ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)). Is there a way to express this in terms of θ? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution.

Alternatively, maybe consider switching variables. Let’s think about the original integral again. The integrand has x² / √(1 + x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x). Let me check if there's a substitution that can combine arsinh(x) and arccos(x). Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts with u = arsinh(x) * arccos(x) and dv = x² / √(1 + x²) dx. Let's try that.

Let’s set u = arsinh(x) * arccos(x), dv = x² / √(1 + x²) dx. Then du would be [d/dx arsinh(x) * arccos(x) + arsinh(x) * d/dx arccos(x)] dx. Let's compute that:

d/dx arsinh(x) = 1 / √(1 + x²)

d/dx arccos(x) = -1 / √(1 - x²)

So du = [ (1 / √(1 + x²)) * arccos(x) + arsinh(x) * (-1 / √(1 - x²)) ] dx

That's a bit messy, but let's proceed. Then, v is the integral of dv = x² / √(1 + x²) dx. Let's compute v.

Compute v = ∫ x² / √(1 + x²) dx. Let me make substitution t = x² + 1, dt = 2x dx. Wait, but the integrand is x² / √(1 + x²). Let me write x² as (1 + x² - 1). So:

v = ∫ (1 + x² - 1)/√(1 + x²) dx = ∫ [√(1 + x²) - 1/√(1 + x²)] dx

So split into two integrals:

v = ∫ √(1 + x²) dx - ∫ 1 / √(1 + x²) dx

The first integral, ∫√(1 + x²) dx, is a standard integral. Let's recall that ∫√(x² + a²) dx = (x/2)√(x² + a²) + (a²/2) ln(x + √(x² + a²)) ) + C. So here a=1, so:

∫√(1 + x²) dx = (x/2)√(1 + x²) + (1/2) ln(x + √(1 + x²)) ) + C

The second integral, ∫1 / √(1 + x²) dx, is arsinh(x) + C, which is ln(x + √(1 + x²)) + C.

So putting it all together:

v = [ (x/2)√(1 + x²) + (1/2) ln(x + √(1 + x²)) ) ] - ln(x + √(1 + x²)) + C

Simplify:

v = (x/2)√(1 + x²) + (1/2) ln(x + √(1 + x²)) - ln(x + √(1 + x²)) + C

Combine the log terms:

v = (x/2)√(1 + x²) - (1/2) ln(x + √(1 + x²)) + C

So v = (x/2)√(1 + x²) - (1/2) arsinh(x) + C

Therefore, when we perform integration by parts, we have:

uv | from 0 to 1 - ∫₀¹ v du

But this seems like it's getting more complicated. The original integral would then be:

[ arsinh(1) * arccos(1) * v(1) ] - [ arsinh(0) * arccos(0) * v(0) ] - ∫₀¹ v * [ (1 / √(1 + x²)) arccos(x) - arsinh(x) / √(1 - x²) ] dx

But arccos(1) is 0, and arsinh(0) is 0, so the boundary terms might vanish. Let's check:

At x=1: arccos(1) = 0, so the first term is 0.

At x=0: arsinh(0) = 0, so the second term is 0.

Therefore, the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ v * [ (arccos(x) / √(1 + x²)) - (arsinh(x) / √(1 - x²)) ] dx

But this seems even more complicated than the original integral. Maybe integration by parts isn't the way to go here. Let's think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can simplify the integrand. Let's look at the original integrand again:

x² / √(1 + x²) * ln(x + √(1 + x²)) * arccos(x)

Let me note that ln(x + √(1 + x²)) is arsinh(x), as before. So the integrand is x² / √(1 + x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x). Maybe we can use substitution u = arsinh(x) or u = arccos(x). Let's try u = arccos(x). Then du = -1 / √(1 - x²) dx. But the integrand has arccos(x) multiplied by other terms. Maybe integrating with respect to u.

Alternatively, consider switching the order of integration or using a substitution that combines both arccos and arsinh. Alternatively, perhaps a trigonometric substitution. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: since we have arccos(x), which is θ in the substitution x = cosθ, and arsinh(x) is ln(x + √(1 + x²)), which in terms of θ would be ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)). Maybe there's a relationship between θ and this expression. Let me compute that.

Let’s compute ln(cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)). Let me square cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ):

[cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ)]² = cos²θ + 2 cosθ √(1 + cos²θ) + 1 + cos²θ = 1 + 2 cos²θ + 2 cosθ √(1 + cos²θ)

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of hyperbolic functions. Let me think. If we set t = sinh(u), then x = sinh(u), but not sure. Alternatively, maybe express the integrand in terms of θ and see if it simplifies.

Wait, let's go back to the substitution x = sinφ. Then √(1 + x²) = √(1 + sin²φ). But not sure. Alternatively, x = sinh t. Then √(1 + x²) = cosh t. Let's try that substitution.

Let’s set x = sinh t, so dx = cosh t dt. Then when x=0, t=0; when x=1, t=arsinh(1) = ln(1 + √2). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{ln(1+√2)} [sinh² t / cosh t] * ln(sinh t + cosh t) * arccos(sinh t) * cosh t dt

Simplify the terms:

sinh² t / cosh t * cosh t = sinh² t

ln(sinh t + cosh t) = ln(e^t) = t

arccos(sinh t) remains as is.

So the integral becomes ∫₀^{ln(1+√2)} sinh² t * t * arccos(sinh t) dt

Hmm, arccos(sinh t) is a bit problematic. Because sinh t ranges from 0 to sinh(ln(1+√2)) = (e^{ln(1+√2)} - e^{-ln(1+√2)}) / 2 = (1 + √2 - 1/(1 + √2)) / 2. Let's compute that:

1/(1 + √2) = (√2 - 1)/ ( (1 + √2)(√2 -1) ) = (√2 -1)/1 = √2 -1. So sinh(ln(1+√2)) = [ (1 + √2) - (√2 -1) ] / 2 = (1 + √2 - √2 +1)/2 = 2/2 =1. So when x=1, t=ln(1+√2), and sinh t =1. So arccos(sinh t) when t=ln(1+√2) is arccos(1) =0. When t=0, sinh t=0, so arccos(0)=π/2.

So the integral becomes ∫₀^{ln(1+√2)} t * arccos(sinh t) * sinh² t dt. Hmm, but arccos(sinh t) is the angle whose cosine is sinh t. Wait, but the domain of arccos is [-1,1], but sinh t for real t is from -infty to infty. However, in our substitution, x is from 0 to1, so sinh t is from 0 to1. So t is from 0 to ln(1+√2), and sinh t is from 0 to1, which is within the domain of arccos. So arccos(sinh t) is valid here.

But how does that help? Let's denote φ = arccos(sinh t). Then cosφ = sinh t. Then we can relate φ and t. Let's see. From cosφ = sinh t, we can write sinh t = cosφ. Then, using the identity cosh^2 t - sinh^2 t =1, so cosh t = √(1 + sinh² t) = √(1 + cos²φ). Hmm, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express t in terms of φ. Since sinh t = cosφ, then t = arsinh(cosφ). But arsinh(z) = ln(z + √(z² +1)), so t = ln(cosφ + √(cos²φ +1)). Wait, but earlier we saw that ln(cosφ + √(1 + cos²φ)) is arsinh(cosφ), which is t. But this seems like a loop.

Alternatively, maybe express the integral in terms of φ. Let’s try substitution φ = arccos(sinh t). Then dφ/dt = - (cosh t) / √(1 - sinh² t). Wait, but sinh t = cosφ, so 1 - sinh² t = 1 - cos²φ = sin²φ. So dφ/dt = - cosh t / |sinφ|. But since t is in [0, ln(1+√2)], sinh t is from 0 to1, so φ is from arccos(1) =0 to arccos(0) = π/2. Wait, no: when t=0, sinh t=0, so φ=arccos(0)=π/2. When t=ln(1+√2), sinh t=1, so φ=arccos(1)=0. So φ decreases from π/2 to 0 as t increases from 0 to ln(1+√2). Therefore, dφ/dt is negative, and we can write dφ = - [cosh t / sinφ] dt. Therefore, dt = - [sinφ / cosh t] dφ. But this seems complicated. Let's see:

We have φ = arccos(sinh t), so sinh t = cosφ. Then, cosh t = √(1 + sinh² t) = √(1 + cos²φ). So cosh t = √(1 + cos²φ). Therefore, dt = - [sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ)] dφ.

So substituting into the integral:

∫₀^{ln(1+√2)} t * φ * sinh² t dt = ∫_{φ=π/2}^{0} t * φ * sinh² t * (- [sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ)] dφ )

Reversing the limits:

∫₀^{π/2} t * φ * sinh² t * [sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ)] dφ

But sinh t = cosφ, so sinh² t = cos²φ. So substituting:

∫₀^{π/2} t * φ * cos²φ * [sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ)] dφ

But t is arsinh(cosφ) = ln(cosφ + √(1 + cos²φ)). So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [ln(cosφ + √(1 + cos²φ))] * φ * cos²φ * [sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ)] dφ

Simplify the terms:

cos²φ * sinφ / √(1 + cos²φ) = [cos²φ / √(1 + cos²φ)] * sinφ

Let me write this as [cos²φ / √(1 + cos²φ)] * φ * ln(cosφ + √(1 + cos²φ)) * sinφ dφ

Wait, this seems similar to the original integral after substitution. In fact, this looks like we're back to the same form as when we did the substitution to θ = arccos(x). Because when we set x = cosθ, we ended up with an integral in terms of θ that looks similar to this. So perhaps this substitution isn't helping. Maybe there's a symmetry or a way to express the integral in terms of itself.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding the logarithm term. Let's recall that ln(x + √(1 + x²)) = arsinh(x). So in the original integral, we have arsinh(x) * arccos(x). Maybe there's a product formula or series expansion for this product. Alternatively, consider expanding both functions in power series and integrating term by term. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, consider switching the order of integration or using a double integral. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps differentiate under the integral sign. Let's see.

Let’s denote I = ∫₀¹ [x² / √(1 + x²)] * arsinh(x) * arccos(x) dx

Suppose we introduce a parameter a into the integral, but I don't see an obvious way to parameterize it. Alternatively, consider integrating with respect to x and see if substitution can help.

Wait, another idea: since we have both arccos(x) and arsinh(x), which are related to inverse trigonometric functions, perhaps integrating over a domain where these functions have a geometric interpretation. For example, arccos(x) is the angle whose cosine is x, and arsinh(x) is the inverse hyperbolic sine. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider integrating by parts with u = arsinh(x) * arccos(x) and dv = x² / √(1 + x²) dx, but we tried that earlier and it got messy. Maybe instead, split the product into two parts. Let’s try integrating by parts with u = arsinh(x) and dv = x² arccos(x) / √(1 + x²) dx. Then du = 1 / √(1 + x²) dx, and v would be the integral of x² arccos(x) / √(1 + x²) dx. But integrating v seems difficult.

Alternatively, reverse the choice: let u = arccos(x), dv = x² arsinh(x) / √(1 + x²) dx. Then du = -1 / √(1 - x²) dx, and v = ∫ x² arsinh(x) / √(1 + x²) dx. Again, integrating v seems complicated.

Hmm. Maybe there's a substitution that can combine terms. Let's look at the original integrand again:

x² / √(1 + x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x)

Let me note that x² / √(1 + x²) can be written as x * x / √(1 + x²). Maybe integration by parts with u = arsinh(x) * arccos(x) and dv = x * x / √(1 + x²) dx. But this seems similar to previous attempts.

Alternatively, consider substitution t = √(1 + x²). Then dt/dx = x / √(1 + x²), so x dx = √(1 + x²) dt. But not sure.

Wait, let's try substitution t = x². Then dt = 2x dx. But the integrand has x² / √(1 + x²) dx, which would be t / √(1 + t) * (dt / 2√t) ) = t / √(1 + t) * dt / (2√t)) = √t / (2√(1 + t)) dt. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, substitution t = 1 + x². Then dt = 2x dx. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, consider expanding arsinh(x) and arccos(x) in terms of their integral representations. For example, arsinh(x) = ∫₀^x 1 / √(1 + t²) dt, and arccos(x) = ∫ₓ¹ 1 / √(1 - t²) dt. Then the integral becomes a triple integral, which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, consider switching to polar coordinates or another coordinate system, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach: numerical integration. The problem asks for both the exact answer and a numerical approximation. But the user first wants the exact answer computed analytically. However, given the complexity of the integrand, it's possible that this integral doesn't have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe it's expressible in terms of special functions or constants. But I need to check.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a clever substitution or identity that I'm missing. Let's think again about the original integrand:

x² / √(1 + x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x)

Let me write arsinh(x) as ln(x + √(1 + x²)). So the integrand is x² / √(1 + x²) * ln(x + √(1 + x²)) * arccos(x). Let me consider substituting t = x + √(1 + x²). Then dt/dx = 1 + (x / √(1 + x²)) = [√(1 + x²) + x] / √(1 + x²) = t / √(1 + x²). So dt = t / √(1 + x²) dx. Therefore, dx = √(1 + x²) / t dt. But x² can be expressed in terms of t. Since t = x + √(1 + x²), then t - x = √(1 + x²). Squaring both sides: t² - 2tx + x² = 1 + x² → t² - 2tx =1 → x = (t² -1)/(2t). So x = (t - 1/t)/2. Therefore, x² = (t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4. Hmm, this might get complicated, but let's try substituting.

So substituting t = x + √(1 + x²), then x = (t - 1/t)/2, dx = √(1 + x²)/t dt. Let's compute √(1 + x²):

√(1 + x²) = √(1 + [(t - 1/t)/2]^2 ) = √(1 + (t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4 ) = √( (4 + t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4 ) = √( (t² + 2 + 1/t²)/4 ) = √( (t + 1/t)^2 /4 ) = (t + 1/t)/2.

So √(1 + x²) = (t + 1/t)/2. Therefore, dx = [(t + 1/t)/2] / t dt = (1 + 1/t²)/2 dt.

Now, let's substitute into the integral:

The integrand is x² / √(1 + x²) * ln(t) * arccos(x) dx.

First, x² = (t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4. Then, √(1 + x²) = (t + 1/t)/2. So x² / √(1 + x²) = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4 ] / [ (t + 1/t)/2 ] = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²) /4 ] * [2 / (t + 1/t) ] = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²) / (2(t + 1/t)) ]

Simplify numerator: t² - 2 + 1/t² = t² + 1/t² - 2 = (t - 1/t)^2. So numerator is (t - 1/t)^2. Denominator is 2(t + 1/t). So x² / √(1 + x²) = (t - 1/t)^2 / [2(t + 1/t)].

Simplify (t - 1/t)^2 / (t + 1/t) = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²) ] / (t + 1/t) = [ (t^4 - 2t² +1) / t² ] / [ (t² +1)/t ] = (t^4 - 2t² +1) / (t²) * t / (t² +1) ) = (t^4 - 2t² +1) t / [ t²(t² +1) ].

Factor numerator: t^4 - 2t² +1 = (t² -1)^2. So we have (t² -1)^2 * t / [ t²(t² +1) ] = t(t² -1)^2 / [ t²(t² +1) ] = (t² -1)^2 / [ t(t² +1) ].

So x² / √(1 + x²) = (t² -1)^2 / [2 t(t² +1) ].

Wait, but earlier step had a denominator of 2(t + 1/t). Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, after substituting:

x² / √(1 + x²) = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²)/4 ] / [ (t + 1/t)/2 ] = [ (t² - 2 + 1/t²) /4 ] * [2 / (t + 1/t) ] = (t² - 2 + 1/t²) / [2(t + 1/t) ]

Then, t² - 2 + 1/t² = (t - 1/t)^2, so we have (t - 1/t)^2 / [2(t + 1/t) ]

Factor numerator and denominator:

(t - 1/t)^2 / [2(t + 1/t) ] = [ (t^2 - 2 + 1/t^2) ] / [2(t + 1/t) ]

But perhaps we can write this as [ (t - 1/t)(t - 1/t) ] / [2(t + 1/t) ]

Not sure. Alternatively, let's write t + 1/t = u. Then t - 1/t = u - 2/t. Not helpful.

Alternatively, note that (t - 1/t) = (t^2 -1)/t. So (t -1/t)^2 = (t^2 -1)^2 / t^2. Then:

(t -1/t)^2 / [2(t +1/t) ] = [ (t^2 -1)^2 / t^2 ] / [2(t +1/t) ] = (t^2 -1)^2 / [2 t^2 (t +1/t) ] = (t^2 -1)^2 / [2 t^2 * (t +1/t) ] = (t^2 -1)^2 / [2 t^2 * ( (t^2 +1)/t ) ] = (t^2 -1)^2 / [2 t (t^2 +1) ]

So x² / √(1 + x²) = (t^2 -1)^2 / [2 t (t^2 +1) ]

Now, the integrand also includes ln(t) and arccos(x). Let's express arccos(x) in terms of t. Since x = (t -1/t)/2, we need to find arccos( (t -1/t)/2 ). Let's denote y = (t -1/t)/2. Then, we need to find arccos(y). Let's see if this can be expressed in terms of t.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between t and the angle in arccos(x). Let me think. If x = cosθ, then t = x + √(1 +x²) = cosθ + √(1 + cos²θ). Earlier substitution didn't lead to simplification. Alternatively, perhaps using hypergeometric functions or other special functions.

Alternatively, perhaps this integral is a known integral or can be related to a known result. Given the complexity, I might need to look for patterns or consider that the integral might evaluate to a simple expression involving π or log terms. Alternatively, it might be zero, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, consider symmetry. Let's check if the integrand is even or odd around some point. The limits are from 0 to1, so symmetry around 0.5? Not sure.

Alternatively, consider substitution z = 1 - x. Let z =1 -x, then when x=0, z=1; x=1, z=0. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [ (1 - z)^2 / √(1 + (1 - z)^2) ] * ln(1 - z + √(1 + (1 - z)^2)) * arccos(1 - z) dz. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate the integral numerically. The user does require a numerical approximation as well. But the first step is to compute it analytically. However, if it's not possible, perhaps the answer is a simple fraction or involves known constants. Let me try to compute it numerically first to see if it gives a clue.

Let me approximate the integral numerically. Let's use substitution x from 0 to1. The integrand is x² / sqrt(1 +x²) * ln(x + sqrt(1 +x²)) * arccos(x). Let's compute this at several points:

At x=0: the integrand is 0 (x² term is 0).

At x=1: arccos(1)=0, so integrand is 0.

In between, the function is positive. Let's approximate using Simpson's rule with a few intervals.

But since I need a precise numerical approximation, perhaps use a calculator or computational tool. However, since I'm doing this manually, let's try to estimate.

Alternatively, use substitution x = sinθ, but not sure. Alternatively, use series expansion of the integrand.

Expand each component in a Taylor series around x=0 and integrate term by term.

First, expand arccos(x) around x=0: arccos(x) = π/2 - x - x^3/(6) - (3x^5)/40 - ... 

Expand arsinh(x) = x - x^3/6 + 3x^5/40 - ... 

Multiply these two series: (π/2 - x - x^3/6 - ...)(x - x^3/6 + 3x^5/40 - ...) 

Multiply term by term:

π/2 * x - π/2 * x^3/6 + π/2 * 3x^5/40 - ... 

- x * x + x * x^3/6 - x * 3x^5/40 + ... 

- x^3/6 * x + x^3/6 * x^3/6 - ... 

So combining terms up to x^5:

π/2 x - (π/2 * 1/6 +1) x^3 + (π/2 * 3/40 + 1/6 + 1/6) x^5 + ... 

But this is getting complicated. Then multiply by x² / sqrt(1 +x²). Expand 1 / sqrt(1 +x²) as 1 - x²/2 + 3x^4/8 - 5x^6/16 + ... 

So x² / sqrt(1 +x²) = x²(1 - x²/2 + 3x^4/8 - ...) = x² - x^4/2 + 3x^6/8 - ... 

Then multiply by the series for arccos(x) * arsinh(x). So the integrand becomes:

(x² - x^4/2 + ...) * [π/2 x - (π/12 +1) x^3 + ... ] 

Multiply term by term:

x² * π/2 x = π/2 x^3

x² * (- (π/12 +1) x^3) = - (π/12 +1) x^5

- x^4/2 * π/2 x = - π/4 x^5

So up to x^5 terms, the integrand is π/2 x^3 - (π/12 +1 + π/4) x^5 + ... 

Integrate from 0 to1:

π/2 ∫x^3 dx - (π/12 +1 + π/4) ∫x^5 dx + ... 

= π/2 * (1/4) - (π/12 +1 + π/4) * (1/6) + ... 

= π/8 - [ (π/12 + π/4 +1) /6 ] + ... 

Simplify the coefficient:

π/12 + π/4 = π/12 + 3π/12 = 4π/12 = π/3. So the coefficient is π/3 +1. Therefore:

= π/8 - (π/3 +1)/6 + ... = π/8 - π/18 -1/6 + ... 

Combine terms:

π/8 - π/18 = (9π -4π)/72 =5π/72. So 5π/72 -1/6 ≈ (5*3.1416)/72 -0.1667 ≈ (15.708)/72 -0.1667 ≈0.2182 -0.1667=0.0515. So the first few terms give a positive value, but higher terms may contribute. However, this is a rough approximation and may not be accurate. 

Given that the integral is positive and the first few terms give around 0.05, but the actual value might be higher. However, this method is not precise enough. 

Alternatively, use numerical integration. Let's approximate using the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. Let's divide the interval [0,1] into n=4 subintervals: x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,1.

Compute the integrand at these points:

At x=0: 0

At x=0.25:

x²=0.0625

sqrt(1 +x²)=sqrt(1.0625)=1.03125

ln(x + sqrt(1 +x²))=ln(0.25 +1.03125)=ln(1.28125)≈0.2485

arccos(0.25)=1.318 radians

So integrand=0.0625 /1.03125 *0.2485 *1.318≈0.0625/1.03125≈0.0606, 0.0606*0.2485≈0.01506, 0.01506*1.318≈0.01985

At x=0.5:

x²=0.25

sqrt(1.25)=1.1180

ln(0.5 +1.1180)=ln(1.6180)≈0.4812

arccos(0.5)=π/3≈1.0472

integrand=0.25/1.1180 *0.4812 *1.0472≈0.2236*0.4812≈0.1076*1.0472≈0.1127

At x=0.75:

x²=0.5625

sqrt(1 +0.5625)=sqrt(1.5625)=1.25

ln(0.75 +1.25)=ln(2.0)=0.6931

arccos(0.75)=0.7227 radians

integrand=0.5625/1.25 *0.6931 *0.7227≈0.45*0.6931≈0.3119*0.7227≈0.2254

At x=1:0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Δx=0.25

Integral≈Δx/2 [f(0) + 2(f(0.25)+f(0.5)+f(0.75)) +f(1)]

=0.25/2 [0 + 2*(0.01985 +0.1127 +0.2254) +0]

=0.125 [2*(0.35795)] =0.125*0.7159≈0.0895

This is a rough estimate with n=4, which is likely an underestimate. Using more intervals would give a better approximation. Let's try n=8.

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, use Simpson's rule for better accuracy. For n=4 (even number of intervals), Simpson's rule is:

Δx/3 [f(0) +4f(0.25)+2f(0.5)+4f(0.75)+f(1)]

=0.25/3 [0 +4*0.01985 +2*0.1127 +4*0.2254 +0]

=0.083333 [0 +0.0794 +0.2254 +0.9016]

=0.083333*(1.2064)≈0.1005

So Simpson's rule with n=4 gives approximately 0.1005. The true value is likely around this. To get a better approximation, let's compute more points.

At x=0.125:

x=0.125

x²=0.015625

sqrt(1 +0.015625)=1.0078

ln(0.125 +1.0078)=ln(1.1328)≈0.1249

arccos(0.125)=1.4455 radians

integrand=0.015625/1.0078 *0.1249 *1.4455≈0.0155*0.1249≈0.00193*1.4455≈0.00279

At x=0.375:

x²=0.140625

sqrt(1 +0.140625)=1.0680

ln(0.375 +1.0680)=ln(1.443)≈0.3662

arccos(0.375)=1.1864 radians

integrand=0.140625/1.0680 *0.3662 *1.1864≈0.1317*0.3662≈0.0482*1.1864≈0.0572

At x=0.625:

x²=0.390625

sqrt(1 +0.390625)=1.1832

ln(0.625 +1.1832)=ln(1.8082)≈0.5924

arccos(0.625)=0.8957 radians

integrand=0.390625/1.1832 *0.5924 *0.8957≈0.3301*0.5924≈0.1956*0.8957≈0.1752

At x=0.875:

x²=0.765625

sqrt(1 +0.765625)=1.3281

ln(0.875 +1.3281)=ln(2.2031)≈0.7903

arccos(0.875)=0.5054 radians

integrand=0.765625/1.3281 *0.7903 *0.5054≈0.5764*0.7903≈0.4553*0.5054≈0.2300

Now, using Simpson's rule with n=8 (Δx=0.125):

Integral≈Δx/3 [f(0) +4(f(0.125)+f(0.375)+f(0.625)+f(0.875)) +2(f(0.25)+f(0.5)+f(0.75)) +f(1)]

=0.125/3 [0 +4*(0.00279+0.0572+0.1752+0.2300) +2*(0.01985+0.1127+0.2254) +0]

Calculate the terms:

4*(0.00279+0.0572+0.1752+0.2300)=4*(0.46519)=1.86076

2*(0.01985+0.1127+0.2254)=2*(0.35795)=0.7159

Total inside the brackets=1.86076 +0.7159=2.57666

Integral≈0.0416667 *2.57666≈0.1074

So with n=8, Simpson's rule gives approximately 0.1074. This is more accurate. To check convergence, let's compare with the previous result of 0.1005 for n=4. The value increased, suggesting that the integral is around 0.107. To get a better approximation, perhaps use n=16, but this is time-consuming manually. Alternatively, accept that the numerical value is approximately 0.1074. However, the problem requires 10 decimal places, which is not feasible manually. Therefore, it's likely that the exact answer is a simple fraction or involves known constants, and the numerical approximation is around 0.1075.

But given the complexity of the integrand, I suspect that the exact answer might be π²/32 or something similar. Let's check:

π²/32 ≈ (9.8696)/32 ≈0.3084, which is larger than our numerical estimate. Alternatively, π²/64≈0.1542. Still not matching. Alternatively, π/16≈0.1963. Not matching. Alternatively, (π² - 8)/32 ≈ (9.8696 -8)/32≈1.8696/32≈0.0584. Not matching. Alternatively, (π² - 96)/ something. Not sure.

Alternatively, the exact answer might involve Catalan's constant or other special constants, but without a closed-form solution, it's hard to say. Given that the integral involves products of inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, it's possible that it doesn't have a simple exact form and requires numerical evaluation.

Given that the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer, but after trying various substitutions and methods without success, I might have to conclude that the integral doesn't have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions and must be expressed in terms of special functions or left as an integral. However, the problem insists on providing an exact answer, so perhaps there's a trick I'm missing.

Wait, let's revisit the substitution x = sinθ. Let’s try that. Let x = sinθ, θ ∈ [0, π/2]. Then dx = cosθ dθ. The integrand becomes:

x² / √(1 +x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x) dx

= sin²θ / √(1 + sin²θ) * arsinh(sinθ) * arccos(sinθ) * cosθ dθ

But arccos(sinθ) = π/2 - θ, since sinθ = cos(π/2 -θ). So arccos(sinθ) = π/2 -θ.

Also, arsinh(sinθ) = ln(sinθ + √(1 + sin²θ)).

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / √(1 + sin²θ) ] * ln(sinθ + √(1 + sin²θ)) * (π/2 -θ) * cosθ dθ

Hmm, but this still seems complicated. Let's check if the term ln(sinθ + √(1 + sin²θ)) can be simplified. Let’s compute:

sinθ + √(1 + sin²θ) = sinh^{-1}(sinθ) + sinh(sinh^{-1}(sinθ)) ?

Wait, no. arsinh(sinθ) = ln(sinθ + √(1 + sin²θ)), so this term is just arsinh(sinθ). So the integral is:

∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²θ / √(1 + sin²θ) ] * arsinh(sinθ) * (π/2 -θ) * cosθ dθ

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps integrate by parts with u = arsinh(sinθ) * (π/2 -θ), dv = [ sin²θ cosθ / √(1 + sin²θ) ] dθ. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, consider substitution t = π/2 -θ. Then when θ=0, t=π/2; θ=π/2, t=0. The integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} [ sin²(π/2 -t) / √(1 + sin²(π/2 -t)) ] * arsinh(sin(π/2 -t)) * t * cos(π/2 -t) (-dt)

Reversing limits:

∫₀^{π/2} [ cos²t / √(1 + cos²t) ] * arsinh(cost) * t * sint dt

Which is the same as the integral we obtained earlier when we did the substitution x = cosθ. So this shows that the integral is equal to itself under this substitution, implying some kind of symmetry but not necessarily helping to solve it.

Given that all attempts to find an analytical solution have failed, and the numerical approximation is around 0.1074, perhaps the exact answer is a known constant or a combination of constants. However, without further insight, I might have to conclude that the integral doesn't have a simple exact form and must be evaluated numerically.

But the problem states to compute it analytically. Therefore, perhaps there's a substitution or identity I'm not seeing. Let me think again.

Wait, consider that the integrand has x² / √(1 +x²) * arsinh(x) * arccos(x). Let's note that arsinh(x) and arccos(x) are both functions that can be expressed as integrals. Maybe express the product as a double integral and interchange the order of integration.

Let’s write arsinh(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 + t²) dt and arccos(x) = ∫ₓ¹ 1/√(1 - s²) ds. Then the integrand becomes:

x² / √(1 +x²) * [∫₀^x 1/√(1 + t²) dt] * [∫ₓ¹ 1/√(1 - s²) ds] dx

This is a triple integral. Maybe interchange the order of integration. Let's consider the region of integration. The variables are t from 0 to x, s from x to1, and x from0 to1. So the region is 0 ≤ t ≤x ≤s ≤1. Changing the order of integration to t, s, x. Let’s visualize the integration region:

t goes from 0 to1.

For each t, s goes from t to1.

For each t and s, x goes from t to s.

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ ∫ₜˢ x² / √(1 +x²) * 1/√(1 + t²) * 1/√(1 - s²) dx ds dt

This seems very complicated, but perhaps integrating over x first.

Compute ∫ₜˢ x² / √(1 +x²) dx. Let’s compute this integral.

Let’s set u = x, dv = x / √(1 +x²) dx. Then du = dx, v = √(1 +x²). So integration by parts:

∫ x² / √(1 +x²) dx = x√(1 +x²) - ∫ √(1 +x²) dx

We already know that ∫√(1 +x²) dx = (x/2)√(1 +x²) + (1/2) arsinh(x)) + C. So:

∫ x² / √(1 +x²) dx = x√(1 +x²) - [ (x/2)√(1 +x²) + (1/2) arsinh(x) ) ] + C = (x/2)√(1 +x²) - (1/2) arsinh(x) + C

Therefore, the integral from t to s is:

[ (s/2)√(1 +s²) - (1/2) arsinh(s) ) ] - [ (t/2)√(1 +t²) - (1/2) arsinh(t) ) ]

= (s/2)√(1 +s²) - (t/2)√(1 +t²) - (1/2)(arsinh(s) - arsinh(t))

So the triple integral becomes:

∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ [ (s/2)√(1 +s²) - (t/2)√(1 +t²) - (1/2)(arsinh(s) - arsinh(t)) ] * 1/√(1 + t²) * 1/√(1 - s²) ds dt

This is still very complicated. Perhaps split into three separate integrals:

I1 = ∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (s/2)√(1 +s²) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] ds dt

I2 = -∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (t/2)√(1 +t²) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] ds dt

I3 = -1/2 ∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (arsinh(s) - arsinh(t)) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] ds dt

Simplify each term:

For I2:

-∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (t/2)√(1 +t²) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] ds dt = -∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (t/2) / √(1 - s²) ds dt

= -∫₀¹ (t/2) [ ∫ₜ¹ 1/√(1 - s²) ds ] dt = -∫₀¹ (t/2) [ π/2 - arcsin(t) ] dt

Because ∫ₜ¹ 1/√(1 - s²) ds = arcsin(1) - arcsin(t) = π/2 - arcsin(t)

So I2 = -∫₀¹ (t/2)(π/2 - arcsin(t)) dt

This integral can be evaluated by parts. Let’s set u = π/2 - arcsin(t), dv = t/2 dt. Then du = -1/√(1 - t²) dt, v = t²/4.

But this might not help. Alternatively, expand the terms:

I2 = - (π/4) ∫₀¹ t dt + (1/2) ∫₀¹ t arcsin(t) dt

= - (π/4)(1/2) + (1/2) ∫₀¹ t arcsin(t) dt

= - π/8 + (1/2) [ (t²/2 +1/4) arcsin(t) - (t/4)√(1 -t²) ] from 0 to1 ]

Wait, the integral ∫ t arcsin(t) dt can be computed by parts. Let u = arcsin(t), dv = t dt. Then du = 1/√(1 -t²) dt, v = t²/2.

So ∫ t arcsin(t) dt = (t²/2) arcsin(t) - ∫ (t²/2) / √(1 -t²) dt

The remaining integral is (1/2) ∫ t² / √(1 -t²) dt. Let’s substitute u =1 -t², du=-2t dt. But t² =1 -u, so:

∫ t² / √(1 -t²) dt = ∫ (1 -u)/√u * (-du/2) = (1/2) ∫ (1 -u)/√u du = (1/2) ∫ (u^{-1/2} - u^{1/2}) du = (1/2)(2u^{1/2} - (2/3)u^{3/2}) ) + C = u^{1/2} - (1/3)u^{3/2} + C = √(1 -t²) - (1/3)(1 -t²)^{3/2} + C

Therefore, ∫ t arcsin(t) dt = (t²/2) arcsin(t) - (1/2)[√(1 -t²) - (1/3)(1 -t²)^{3/2}] + C

Evaluate from 0 to1:

At t=1: (1/2) arcsin(1) - (1/2)[0 -0] = (1/2)(π/2)

At t=0: 0 - (1/2)[1 -1/3*1] = - (1/2)(2/3) = -1/3

So the definite integral is (π/4) - (-1/3) = π/4 +1/3

Therefore, I2 = -π/8 + (1/2)(π/4 +1/3) = -π/8 + π/8 +1/6 =1/6 ≈0.1667

Now, let's compute I1:

I1 = ∫₀¹ ∫ₜ¹ (s/2)√(1 +s²) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] ds dt

This seems complicated. Let's change the order of integration. For I1, the limits are t from0 to1, s from t to1. So equivalently, s from0 to1, t from0 to s.

So I1 = ∫₀¹ ∫₀ˢ (s/2)√(1 +s²) / [√(1 + t²)√(1 - s²)] dt ds

= ∫₀¹ (s/2)√(1 +s²) / √(1 - s²) [ ∫₀ˢ 1/√(1 + t²) dt ] ds

The inner integral is arsinh(s). So:

I1 = ∫₀¹ (s/2)√(1 +s²) / √(1 - s²) * arsinh(s) ds

This is still complicated. Let's make substitution u = s². Then du = 2s ds. But not sure. Alternatively, substitution u =1 -s². Then du = -2s ds. But not helpful.

Alternatively, note that √(1 +s²) / √(1 -s²) = √( (1 +s²)/(1 -s²) ) = sqrt( (1 -s² + 2s²)/(1 -s²) ) = sqrt(1 + 2s²/(1 -s²)). Not helpful.

Alternatively, express in terms of hypergeometric functions, but this is beyond my current knowledge.

Similarly, I3 is also complicated. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think it's safe to assume that this integral doesn't have a closed-form solution and must be evaluated numerically. Therefore, the exact answer is expressed as the integral itself, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1075.

But the problem requires an exact answer in LaTeX. Given that I couldn't find an analytical solution, perhaps the answer is zero, but the numerical approximation contradicts that. Alternatively, the integral might evaluate to π²/32 - 1/4 or similar, but without further insight, I can't determine it. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed to provide the numerical approximation and state the exact answer as the integral itself, although this might not be what the problem expects. However, given the instructions, I must provide an exact answer. 

Wait, perhaps the integral can be expressed in terms of known constants. Let me check the numerical approximation again. Using Simpson's rule with n=8, we got approximately 0.1074. Let's compute this more accurately using a calculator. However, since I can't do that here, I'll note that the numerical value is approximately 0.1075. 

Alternatively, perhaps the exact answer is π²/32 - 1/4. Let's compute that: π²/32 ≈0.3084, 0.3084 -0.25=0.0584, which doesn't match. Alternatively, π²/16 -1/2≈0.6168 -0.5=0.1168, closer but not matching. Alternatively, π²/24≈0.4112, π²/24 -1/4≈0.4112-0.25=0.1612. Not matching. Alternatively, π²/48≈0.2056, π²/48 -1/8≈0.2056-0.125=0.0806. Still not matching. 

Given that I can't find an exact analytical solution and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1075, I'll have to present the integral as is for the exact answer and provide the numerical approximation. However, the problem insists on an exact answer, so perhaps there's a trick I missed. 

Wait, let's consider integrating by parts with u = arccos(x) and dv = x² arsinh(x) / √(1 +x²) dx. Then du = -1/√(1 -x²) dx, and v = ∫ x² arsinh(x) / √(1 +x²) dx. Let's compute v.

Let’s compute v = ∫ x² arsinh(x) / √(1 +x²) dx. Let’s make substitution t = arsinh(x). Then x = sinh(t), dx = cosh(t) dt. Then √(1 +x²) = cosh(t). So the integral becomes:

∫ sinh²(t) * t / cosh(t) * cosh(t) dt = ∫ sinh²(t) t dt

= ∫ t (cosh(2t) -1)/2 dt = (1/2) ∫ t cosh(2t) dt - (1/2) ∫ t dt

Compute each integral:

∫ t cosh(2t) dt = (t/2) sinh(2t) - (1/4) cosh(2t) + C

∫ t dt = t²/2 + C

So v = (1/2)[ (t/2 sinh(2t) -1/4 cosh(2t)) ] - (1/2)(t²/2) + C

= t/4 sinh(2t) -1/8 cosh(2t) - t²/4 + C

Now, revert back to x:

t = arsinh(x) = ln(x + √(1 +x²))

sinh(2t) = 2 sinh(t) cosh(t) = 2x√(1 +x²)

cosh(2t) = 2 cosh²(t) -1 = 2(1 +x²) -1 = 2x² +1

So v = (1/4) ln(x + √(1 +x²)) * 2x√(1 +x²) -1/8 (2x² +1) - (1/4)(ln(x + √(1 +x²)))^2 + C

Simplify:

= (x/2)√(1 +x²) ln(x + √(1 +x²)) - (2x² +1)/8 - (1/4)(arsinh(x))² + C

Therefore, returning to integration by parts:

The original integral I = uv |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du

= [arccos(x) * v]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v * (-1/√(1 -x²)) dx

At x=1: arccos(1)=0, so first term is 0.

At x=0: arccos(0)=π/2, and v(0) is:

v at x=0: (0/2)*... - (0 +1)/8 - (1/4)(0)^2 + C = -1/8 + C. But since v is an antiderivative, the constant C cancels in definite integral. However, since we're evaluating v from 0 to1, the boundary term at x=0 is π/2 * [v(0) - C], but this is unclear. This approach seems to lead to a more complicated integral.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the integral does not have a closed-form solution and must be evaluated numerically. Therefore, the exact answer is the integral itself, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.1075. However, the problem requires an exact answer, so perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, the answer is zero, but the numerical approximation contradicts that. 

After extensive consideration, I think the integral evaluates to π²/16 - 1/2, which is approximately (9.8696)/16 -0.5 ≈0.6168 -0.5=0.1168, which is close to the numerical estimate but not exact. Alternatively, π²/24 ≈0.4112, which is not match. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to provide the numerical approximation and state the exact answer as the integral itself, though this is not ideal.
