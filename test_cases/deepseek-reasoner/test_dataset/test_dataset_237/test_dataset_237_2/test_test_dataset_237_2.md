Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral given is ∫₀¹ x^(-3/4) (1 - x)^(-1/4) [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it.

First, I notice the terms x^(-3/4) and (1 - x)^(-1/4). These remind me of the Beta function, which has the form B(a,b) = ∫₀¹ x^(a-1)(1 - x)^(b-1) dx. The exponents here are -3/4 and -1/4, so if I set a - 1 = -3/4 and b - 1 = -1/4, that would give a = 1/4 and b = 3/4. But the Beta function is Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b), so maybe that's part of the solution. However, there's also the [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) term complicating things. I need to handle that part.

Let me think about substitutions. The term inside the square root is x(1 - x), which is symmetric around x = 1/2. Maybe a trigonometric substitution? Let's try x = sin²θ. Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's see:

When x = sin²θ, then 1 - x = cos²θ. So √(x(1 - x)) = sinθ cosθ. The denominator becomes [1 - sinθ cosθ]^2. Let's substitute:

x^(-3/4) = (sin²θ)^(-3/4) = sin^(-3/2)θ

(1 - x)^(-1/4) = (cos²θ)^(-1/4) = cos^(-1/2)θ

dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ

So the integral becomes:

∫ [sin^(-3/2)θ * cos^(-1/2)θ * 2 sinθ cosθ] / [1 - sinθ cosθ]^2 dθ

Simplify the numerator:

sin^(-3/2)θ * sinθ = sin^(-1/2)θ

cos^(-1/2)θ * cosθ = cos^(1/2)θ

So numerator is 2 sin^(-1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ

Thus, integral becomes 2 ∫ [sin^(-1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ] / [1 - sinθ cosθ]^2 dθ

Wait, that's 2 ∫ [sin^(-1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ] / [1 - (sinθ cosθ)]^2 dθ

Hmm, maybe simplifying the denominator. Let's note that sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ. So 1 - (1/2) sin2θ. But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution.

Alternatively, maybe a substitution t = √(x(1 - x)) = √(x - x²). Let me try that. Let t = √(x - x²). Then t² = x - x², so x² - x + t² = 0. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, set t = x/(1 - x), but not sure.

Wait, let's go back to the trigonometric substitution. Let me check the limits. When x=0, sinθ=0, so θ=0. When x=1, sinθ=1, so θ=π/2. So the integral becomes from 0 to π/2.

So integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin^(-1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ] / [1 - sinθ cosθ]^2 dθ

Hmm, maybe simplifying the denominator. Let's compute 1 - sinθ cosθ. Let's write that as 1 - (1/2) sin2θ. But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of t = tanθ. Let me try that substitution.

Let t = tanθ, so θ from 0 to π/2 corresponds to t from 0 to ∞. Then sinθ = t/√(1 + t²), cosθ = 1/√(1 + t²), dθ = dt/(1 + t²).

Let's substitute into the integral:

I = 2 ∫₀^∞ [ (t/√(1 + t²))^(-1/2) * (1/√(1 + t²))^(1/2) ) / (1 - (t/√(1 + t²))(1/√(1 + t²)) )² ] * [dt/(1 + t²)]

Simplify the terms:

First, the numerator inside the integral:

(t/√(1 + t²))^(-1/2) = t^(-1/2) (1 + t²)^(1/4)

(1/√(1 + t²))^(1/2) = (1 + t²)^(-1/4)

Multiplying these gives t^(-1/2) (1 + t²)^(1/4) * (1 + t²)^(-1/4) = t^(-1/2)

Denominator: [1 - (t)/(1 + t²)]²

Compute 1 - t/(1 + t²) = (1 + t² - t)/(1 + t²) = (t² - t + 1)/(1 + t²)

So denominator becomes [ (t² - t + 1)/(1 + t²) ]² = (t² - t + 1)^2 / (1 + t²)^2

Putting it all together:

I = 2 ∫₀^∞ [ t^(-1/2) / ( (t² - t + 1)^2 / (1 + t²)^2 ) ] * [dt/(1 + t²) ]

Simplify the fractions:

= 2 ∫₀^∞ t^(-1/2) * (1 + t²)^2 / (t² - t + 1)^2 * dt/(1 + t²)

= 2 ∫₀^∞ t^(-1/2) * (1 + t²) / (t² - t + 1)^2 dt

So I = 2 ∫₀^∞ t^(-1/2) (1 + t²) / (t² - t + 1)^2 dt

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can manipulate the denominator. Let's note that t² - t + 1 can be written as (t - 1/2)^2 + 3/4, which is always positive. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps partial fractions or another substitution.

Alternatively, let's make substitution u = t + 1/t. Wait, but t is from 0 to ∞. Let me try substitution u = t + 1/t. Wait, but when t approaches 0, u approaches ∞, and when t approaches ∞, u approaches ∞. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, substitution u = t - 1/(2t), but not sure.

Alternatively, let's split the integral into two parts. Let me write the integrand as t^(-1/2) (1 + t²) / (t² - t + 1)^2 ). Let's perform polynomial division or see if the numerator can be expressed in terms of the denominator.

Let me compute the denominator: (t² - t + 1)^2 = t^4 - 2t^3 + 3t² - 2t + 1. The numerator is 1 + t². Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps take derivative of denominator.

Let me compute d/dt (t² - t + 1) = 2t - 1. Hmm, not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe express the integrand in terms of t + 1/t. Let me set t = y², so that t^(-1/2) dt = 2 dy. Wait, let's try substitution y = sqrt(t), so t = y², dt = 2y dy. Then the integral becomes:

I = 2 ∫₀^∞ (y²)^(-1/2) (1 + y⁴) / (y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 * 2y dy

Simplify:

(y²)^(-1/2) = y^(-1), so:

= 2 * 2 ∫₀^∞ y^(-1) (1 + y⁴) / (y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 * y dy

= 4 ∫₀^∞ (1 + y⁴) / (y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution. Let me check if the denominator factors. Let's see: y⁴ - y² + 1. Let me set z = y², then denominator becomes z² - z + 1. The discriminant is 1 - 4 = -3, so it doesn't factor over real numbers. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps substitution z = y + 1/y. Let me try that. Let z = y + 1/y. Then when y approaches 0, z approaches ∞, and when y approaches ∞, z approaches ∞. The minimum of z is 2 when y=1. Hmm, but integrating over z might be complicated. Let's compute dz = 1 - 1/y² dy. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution u = y³ or something. Not sure. Alternatively, note that the integrand is even or has some symmetry. Wait, the current integral after substitution is 4 ∫₀^∞ (1 + y⁴)/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy. Let me check if this is symmetric under y → 1/y. Let's substitute y = 1/t. When y → 1/t, dy = -1/t² dt. Then the integral becomes:

4 ∫₀^∞ (1 + (1/t)^4)/( (1/t)^4 - (1/t)^2 + 1 )^2 * (-1/t²) dt

But the limits would flip from ∞ to 0, so with the negative sign, it becomes:

4 ∫₀^∞ (1 + t⁻⁴)/( t⁻⁴ - t⁻² + 1 )² * t⁻² dt

Multiply numerator and denominator by t⁸:

Numerator: t⁸(1 + t⁻⁴) = t⁸ + t⁴

Denominator: (1 - t² + t⁴)²

So the integral becomes 4 ∫₀^∞ (t⁸ + t⁴)/( (t⁴ - t² + 1)^2 ) * t⁻² dt

= 4 ∫₀^∞ (t⁶ + t²)/(t⁴ - t² + 1)^2 dt

But the original integral after substitution was 4 ∫₀^∞ (1 + y⁴)/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy. Comparing with the transformed integral, which is 4 ∫₀^∞ (t⁶ + t²)/(t⁴ - t² + 1)^2 dt. Not sure if that helps. Maybe adding the two expressions:

Original I = 4 ∫ (1 + y⁴)/(D)^2 dy

Transformed I = 4 ∫ (y⁶ + y²)/(D)^2 dy

If we add them, we get 4 ∫ (1 + y⁴ + y⁶ + y²)/(D)^2 dy. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe subtract them. Hmm, not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the integrand can be expressed as a derivative. Let me compute the derivative of (y³ + Ay + B)/(y⁴ - y² + 1). Let's see:

Let’s suppose that d/dy [ (some function) ] = (1 + y⁴)/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2. Let me try to find such a function.

Let’s denote D = y⁴ - y² + 1. Then D’ = 4y³ - 2y.

Suppose we have a function f(y) = (A y³ + B y² + C y + D)/D. Then f’(y) would be [ (3A y² + 2B y + C) D - (A y³ + B y² + C y + D)(4y³ - 2y) ] / D². This seems complicated, but maybe choose A, B, C, D such that numerator equals 1 + y⁴.

Alternatively, maybe try to write the integrand as a combination of D’ and something else. Let me see:

The integrand is (1 + y⁴)/D². Let me note that D = y⁴ - y² + 1, so y⁴ = D + y² - 1. Therefore, 1 + y⁴ = D + y². So the integrand becomes (D + y²)/D² = 1/D + y²/D². So:

I = 4 ∫₀^∞ [1/D + y²/D²] dy, where D = y⁴ - y² + 1.

So split the integral into two parts:

I = 4 [ ∫₀^∞ 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy + ∫₀^∞ y²/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy ]

Hmm, maybe these integrals can be evaluated separately. Let's first compute ∫ 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy. Let me factor the denominator. The denominator is y⁴ - y² + 1. Let me set z = y², so it becomes z² - z + 1. The roots of z² - z + 1 = 0 are [1 ± i√3]/2. So the denominator factors into (z - (1 + i√3)/2)(z - (1 - i√3)/2). Therefore, over real numbers, it's irreducible. So to integrate 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy, we can use partial fractions with complex roots, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, use substitution.

Alternatively, note that y⁴ - y² + 1 = y⁴ + 2y² + 1 - 3y² = (y² + 1)^2 - (√3 y)^2 = (y² + 1 - √3 y)(y² + 1 + √3 y). So it factors into (y² - √3 y + 1)(y² + √3 y + 1). Therefore, we can write:

1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) = [A y + B]/(y² - √3 y + 1) + [C y + D]/(y² + √3 y + 1)

But integrating this would require partial fractions. Let me check if this approach is feasible.

Alternatively, use substitution. Let me consider the integral ∫ 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy. Let’s make substitution t = y - 1/(2y). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, use substitution y = tanθ. Let me try:

If y = tanθ, then dy = sec²θ dθ. The integral becomes ∫ sec²θ dθ / (tan⁴θ - tan²θ + 1). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, write the denominator in terms of sin and cos. Let me compute:

tan⁴θ - tan²θ + 1 = (sin⁴θ/cos⁴θ) - (sin²θ/cos²θ) + 1. Multiply numerator and denominator by cos⁴θ:

= sin⁴θ - sin²θ cos²θ + cos⁴θ. Hmm, sin⁴θ + cos⁴θ = (sin²θ + cos²θ)^2 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ = 1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ. So denominator becomes 1 - 2 sin²θ cos²θ - sin²θ cos²θ = 1 - 3 sin²θ cos²θ. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, use substitution t = y + 1/y. Let me try that. Let t = y + 1/y. Then y² + 1/y² = t² - 2. The denominator y⁴ - y² + 1 = y²(y² - 1 + 1/y²) = y²( (y² + 1/y²) -1 ) = y²( (t² - 2) -1 ) = y²(t² - 3). But not sure.

Alternatively, note that the integral is from 0 to ∞, so maybe use substitution y = 1/t. Let’s see:

∫₀^∞ 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy = ∫₀^∞ t²/(t⁴ - t² + 1) dt. So adding to the original integral:

∫₀^∞ (1 + t²)/(t⁴ - t² + 1) dt. But this is similar to the previous approach. Let me compute this as J = ∫₀^∞ (1 + y²)/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy. Let me split the numerator:

(1 + y²) = (y⁴ - y² + 1) + y² - y⁴. Wait, no. Alternatively, note that y⁴ - y² + 1 = (y² + 1)^2 - 3y². So maybe use substitution related to that.

Alternatively, write the denominator as (y² + 1)^2 - (√3 y)^2 = (y² + √3 y + 1)(y² - √3 y + 1). Then use partial fractions. Let me try:

Assume 1/(y⁴ - y² + 1) = (A y + B)/(y² + √3 y + 1) + (C y + D)/(y² - √3 y + 1)

Multiply both sides by (y² + √3 y + 1)(y² - √3 y + 1):

1 = (A y + B)(y² - √3 y + 1) + (C y + D)(y² + √3 y + 1)

Expand both terms:

First term: A y³ - A √3 y² + A y + B y² - B √3 y + B

Second term: C y³ + C √3 y² + C y + D y² + D √3 y + D

Combine like terms:

y³: (A + C) y³

y²: (-A √3 + B + C √3 + D) y²

y: (A - B √3 + C + D √3) y

Constants: (B + D)

Set coefficients equal to 0 except the constant term which is 1:

1. A + C = 0

2. (-A √3 + B + C √3 + D) = 0

3. (A - B √3 + C + D √3) = 0

4. B + D = 1

From equation 1: C = -A

Substitute C = -A into equation 2:

- A √3 + B - A √3 + D = 0 → -2 A √3 + B + D = 0

From equation 4: B + D = 1, so substitute into above:

-2 A √3 + 1 = 0 → A = 1/(2 √3)

Then C = -1/(2 √3)

Now equation 3:

A - B √3 + C + D √3 = 0

Substitute A and C:

1/(2 √3) - B √3 -1/(2 √3) + D √3 = 0 → (-B √3 + D √3) = 0 → √3 (D - B) = 0 → D = B

From equation 4: B + D = 1 and D = B → 2B = 1 → B = 1/2, D = 1/2

So the partial fractions are:

( (1/(2√3)) y + 1/2 ) / (y² + √3 y + 1) + ( (-1/(2√3)) y + 1/2 ) / (y² - √3 y + 1)

Therefore, the integral J = ∫₀^∞ [ ( (1/(2√3)) y + 1/2 ) / (y² + √3 y + 1) + ( (-1/(2√3)) y + 1/2 ) / (y² - √3 y + 1) ] dy

Let's split this into two integrals:

J = (1/(2√3)) ∫₀^∞ [ y / (y² + √3 y + 1) ] dy + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ 1 / (y² + √3 y + 1) ] dy + (-1/(2√3)) ∫₀^∞ [ y / (y² - √3 y + 1) ] dy + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ 1 / (y² - √3 y + 1) ] dy

Let me handle each integral separately.

First integral: I1 = ∫₀^∞ y / (y² + √3 y + 1) dy

Let’s complete the square in the denominator:

y² + √3 y + 1 = (y + √3/2)^2 + 1 - 3/4 = (y + √3/2)^2 + 1/4

Let’s substitute u = y + √3/2, then y = u - √3/2, dy = du. The integral becomes:

∫_{√3/2}^∞ [ (u - √3/2) / (u² + 1/4) ] du

This can be split into two integrals:

∫ [ u / (u² + 1/4) ] du - (√3/2) ∫ [ 1 / (u² + 1/4) ] du

The first integral is (1/2) ln(u² + 1/4) evaluated from √3/2 to ∞. The second integral is (√3/2) * (2) arctan(2u) evaluated from √3/2 to ∞.

But as u approaches ∞, ln(u² + 1/4) ~ 2 ln u, which diverges. Wait, but the original integral I1 is from 0 to ∞. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different substitution.

Wait, perhaps for I1, let’s write the denominator as y² + √3 y + 1. Let’s set t = y + √3/2, but maybe not. Alternatively, note that the integral might diverge? Wait, the original integrand is y/(y² + √3 y + 1). As y approaches infinity, the integrand behaves like 1/y, which integrates to log y, which diverges. But this contradicts the original problem, which should converge. Wait, but the original integral J is ∫₀^∞ (1 + y²)/(y⁴ - y² + 1) dy. Wait, but when we split into partial fractions, we have terms that might individually diverge but their combination converges. So maybe integrating from 0 to ∞ requires careful consideration.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating over the entire real line by symmetry. Wait, but the integral is from 0 to ∞. Alternatively, consider that the integrand is even function if extended to negative y, but since y is from 0 to ∞, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution y = 1/t in I1. Let’s try:

I1 = ∫₀^∞ y / (y² + √3 y + 1 ) dy

Let y = 1/t, dy = -1/t² dt. Then:

I1 = ∫∞^0 (1/t) / ( (1/t²) + √3 (1/t) + 1 ) * (-1/t²) dt

= ∫₀^∞ (1/t) / ( (1 + √3 t + t²)/t² ) * (1/t²) dt

= ∫₀^∞ (1/t) * t² / (1 + √3 t + t²) * (1/t²) dt

= ∫₀^∞ 1/(1 + √3 t + t²) dt

Which is the same as the integral I3 = ∫₀^∞ 1/(t² + √3 t + 1) dt. So I1 = I3.

Similarly, the third integral in J is:

I4 = ∫₀^∞ y / (y² - √3 y + 1) dy. Similarly, substitute y = 1/t:

I4 = ∫₀^∞ 1/(t² - √3 t + 1) dt = I5.

But I5 is similar to I3 but with -√3. So perhaps there's a relationship between these integrals.

But this seems getting too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me recall that the original integral I was expressed as 4(J + K), where J is ∫1/D dy and K is ∫y²/D² dy. But maybe there's a relationship between J and K.

Alternatively, note that integrating by parts. Let’s consider K = ∫ y²/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy. Let’s set u = y, dv = y/(y⁴ - y² + 1)^2 dy. Then du = dy, and dv = y/(D)^2 dy. To find v, integrate dv:

v = ∫ y/(D)^2 dy. Let’s set z = D = y⁴ - y² + 1, then dz/dy = 4y³ - 2y. Not directly helpful. Alternatively, note that d/dy (1/D) = - (4y³ - 2y)/D². Hmm, but not directly helpful.

Alternatively, consider that d/dy ( (something) / D ) = ... Maybe not. This seems too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another approach to the original integral.

Wait, going back to the original integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x^(-3/4) (1 - x)^(-1/4) [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) dx

Let me consider substitution t = √(x(1 - x)) = √(x - x²). Let’s set t = √(x - x²). Then t² = x - x² → x² - x + t² = 0. Solving for x: x = [1 ± √(1 - 4t²)]/2. But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, set t = x/(1 - x). Then x = t/(1 + t), 1 - x = 1/(1 + t), dx = dt/(1 + t)^2. Let's try this substitution.

Substitute x = t/(1 + t), so x ranges from 0 to 1 as t goes from 0 to ∞.

Then:

x^(-3/4) = (t/(1 + t))^(-3/4) = t^(-3/4) (1 + t)^(3/4)

(1 - x)^(-1/4) = (1/(1 + t))^(-1/4) = (1 + t)^(1/4)

[1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) = [1 - √( t/(1 + t) * 1/(1 + t) ) ]^(-2) = [1 - √(t)/(1 + t) ]^(-2)

dx = dt/(1 + t)^2

Putting it all together:

I = ∫₀^∞ [ t^(-3/4) (1 + t)^(3/4) * (1 + t)^(1/4) / (1 - √t/(1 + t))² ] * dt/(1 + t)^2

Simplify exponents:

(1 + t)^(3/4 + 1/4) = (1 + t)^1

So:

I = ∫₀^∞ t^(-3/4) (1 + t) / (1 - √t/(1 + t))² * dt/(1 + t)^2

= ∫₀^∞ t^(-3/4) / (1 + t) * [1 / (1 - √t/(1 + t))² ] dt

Simplify the denominator term:

1 - √t/(1 + t) = [ (1 + t) - √t ] / (1 + t )

So [1 - √t/(1 + t)]² = [ (1 + t - √t )² ] / (1 + t)^2

Thus, the integral becomes:

I = ∫₀^∞ t^(-3/4) / (1 + t) * (1 + t)^2 / (1 + t - √t )² dt

= ∫₀^∞ t^(-3/4) (1 + t) / (1 + t - √t )² dt

Hmm, still complicated. Let me make substitution u = √t. Let u = t^(1/2), so t = u², dt = 2u du. Then:

I = ∫₀^∞ (u²)^(-3/4) (1 + u²) / (1 + u² - u )² * 2u du

Simplify:

(u²)^(-3/4) = u^(-3/2)

Multiply by 2u: 2u * u^(-3/2) = 2 u^(-1/2) = 2 / √u

So:

I = 2 ∫₀^∞ (1 + u²) / (1 + u² - u )² * du / √u

Hmm, not sure. Let me write the denominator as (u² - u + 1)². Wait, 1 + u² - u = u² - u + 1. So:

I = 2 ∫₀^∞ (1 + u²) / (u² - u + 1 )² * du / √u

= 2 ∫₀^∞ (1 + u²) / (u² - u + 1 )² * u^(-1/2) du

= 2 ∫₀^∞ u^(-1/2) (1 + u²) / (u² - u + 1 )² du

This seems similar to the integral we had before. Maybe this is a dead end. Let me think differently.

Wait, the original integral resembles an Beta function but with an extra term. Maybe use hypergeometric functions? Alternatively, consider expanding [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) as a series.

Let me try expanding [1 - a]^(-2) as a power series. The expansion is Σ (n + 1) a^n for |a| < 1. Here, a = √(x(1 - x)). Since x is between 0 and 1, √(x(1 - x)) has maximum value 1/2 at x=1/2, so |a| < 1/2 < 1. Therefore, the series converges.

Thus, [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^(-2) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) [√(x(1 - x))]^n = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) x^{n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

I = ∫₀¹ x^{-3/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) x^{n/2} (1 - x)^{n/2} dx

= Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) ∫₀¹ x^{-3/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{-1/4 + n/2} dx

Each term in the series is a Beta function:

∫₀¹ x^{a - 1} (1 - x)^{b - 1} dx = B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b)

Here, a = -3/4 + n/2 + 1 = 1/4 + n/2, and b = -1/4 + n/2 + 1 = 3/4 + n/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the integrand is x^{-3/4 + n/2} (1 - x)^{-1/4 + n/2}, so a = -3/4 + n/2 + 1? Wait, no. The Beta function is ∫₀¹ x^{a - 1} (1 - x)^{b - 1} dx. So comparing:

a - 1 = -3/4 + n/2 → a = 1/4 + n/2

b - 1 = -1/4 + n/2 → b = 3/4 + n/2

Therefore, each integral is B(1/4 + n/2, 3/4 + n/2) = Γ(1/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) / Γ(1 + n)

Using the property Γ(z)Γ(1 - z) = π / sin(π z), but not sure. Also, Γ(1/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) = π / sin(π (1/4 + n/2)) ) using the reflection formula. Let's check:

Γ(1/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) = Γ(1/4 + n/2) Γ(1 - (1/4 + n/2)) = π / sin(π (1/4 + n/2))

But Γ(1/4 + n/2) Γ(3/4 + n/2) = π / sin(π (1/4 + n/2))

So the integral becomes:

Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) [ π / sin(π (1/4 + n/2)) ] / Γ(1 + n)

But Γ(1 + n) = n!

So I = π Σ_{n=0}^∞ (n + 1) / [ n! sin(π (1/4 + n/2)) ]

This seems complicated, but maybe we can simplify the terms. Let's consider even and odd n separately.

Let n = 2k for even terms and n = 2k + 1 for odd terms.

For even n = 2k:

sin(π (1/4 + k)) = sin(π/4 + kπ) = sin(π/4) cos(kπ) + cos(π/4) sin(kπ) = sin(π/4) (-1)^k

Similarly, for odd n = 2k + 1:

sin(π (1/4 + k + 1/2)) = sin(π/4 + kπ + π/2) = sin(3π/4 + kπ) = sin(3π/4) cos(kπ) + cos(3π/4) sin(kπ) = sin(3π/4) (-1)^k = √2/2 (-1)^k

So split the series into even and odd terms:

I = π [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) / [ (2k)! sin(π (1/4 + k)) ] + Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2) / [ (2k + 1)! sin(π (1/4 + k + 1/2)) ] ]

Substitute the sine values:

For even terms (n=2k):

sin(π (1/4 + k)) = sin(π/4 + kπ) = (-1)^k sin(π/4) = (-1)^k √2/2

For odd terms (n=2k+1):

sin(π (1/4 + k + 1/2)) = sin(3π/4 + kπ) = (-1)^k sin(3π/4) = (-1)^k √2/2

Thus, both series:

I = π [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) / [ (2k)! * (-1)^k √2/2 ] + Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2) / [ (2k + 1)! * (-1)^k √2/2 ] ]

Factor out constants:

= π * 2/√2 [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) (-1)^k / (2k)! ) + Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2) (-1)^k / (2k + 1)! ) ]

Simplify 2/√2 = √2:

= π √2 [ Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) (-1)^k / (2k)! ) + Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2) (-1)^k / (2k + 1)! ) ]

Let’s handle each series separately.

First series: S1 = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) (-1)^k / (2k)! )

Note that (2k + 1)/ (2k)! = 1/(2k -1)! ) * (2k + 1)/(2k(2k -1)) )... Wait, maybe relate to known series. Let's recall that:

cos x = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k x^{2k} / (2k)!

sin x = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k x^{2k + 1} / (2k + 1)!

Also, derivatives:

cos x derivative is -sin x, sin x derivative is cos x.

Let’s see:

S1 = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 1) (-1)^k / (2k)! )

Let’s write 2k + 1 = (2k) + 1. So:

S1 = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2k / (2k)! + 1/(2k)! ] (-1)^k

= Σ_{k=0}^∞ [2k / (2k)! ] (-1)^k + Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(2k)! ] (-1)^k

The second sum is Σ (-1)^k / (2k)! = cos(1)

The first sum: 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k)! )

Let’s note that k/(2k)! = 1/(2 (2k -1)! )

But for k ≥ 1, since when k=0, the term is 0. So:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k)! ) = (1/2) Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^k / (2k -1)! )

Let m = k -1, then k = m +1, so Σ_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^{m+1} / (2m +1)! ) = - Σ_{m=0}^∞ (-1)^m / (2m +1)! ) = - sin(1)

Thus, the first sum is 2 * (-1/2) sin(1) = - sin(1)

Therefore, S1 = - sin(1) + cos(1)

Second series: S2 = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k + 2) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! )

Factor out 2: 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! )

Let’s write (k +1) = (2k +1 +1 -k)/2. Not sure. Alternatively, note that:

(k +1)/ (2k +1)! = 1/(2k +1)! ) + k/(2k +1)! )

But not sure. Alternatively, consider:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k +1 +1 -k ) / (2k +1)! ) ] (-1)^k. Not helpful.

Alternatively, note that:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) + Σ_{k=0}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k +1)! )

The first sum is sin(1). The second sum:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k +1)! )

Let’s = m = k-1, but k starts at 0, so for k=0, term is 0. So start at k=1:

Σ_{k=1}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) = Σ_{m=0}^∞ (m +1) (-1)^{m+1} / (2m +3)! )

Not sure. Alternatively, relate to derivatives of sin and cos.

Let’s consider the function f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k x^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! ) = sin x

Then x f(x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k x^{2k +2} / (2k +1)! )

The derivative of x f(x) is Σ_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k (2k +2) x^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! ) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +2) (-1)^k x^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! )

Which is similar to our S2 multiplied by x. But S2 is Σ (2k +2) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ), which is the coefficient of x^{2k +1} evaluated at x=1. So:

d/dx [x sin x ] = sin x + x cos x

But also, d/dx [x sin x ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +2) (-1)^k x^{2k +1} / (2k +1)! )

Evaluated at x=1, this is sin(1) + cos(1)

Therefore, S2 = 2 * [ sin(1) + cos(1) ]

Wait, no. Wait, S2 is 2 times Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ), which is 2 times [ sin(1) + Σ_{k=0}^∞ k (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) ]

But from the derivative above, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k +2) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) = sin(1) + cos(1)

But (2k +2) = 2(k +1), so Σ_{k=0}^∞ (k +1) (-1)^k / (2k +1)! ) = (sin(1) + cos(1))/2

Therefore, S2 = 2 * (sin(1) + cos(1))/2 = sin(1) + cos(1)

Therefore, combining S1 and S2:

I = π √2 [ ( - sin(1) + cos(1)) + (sin(1) + cos(1)) ]

Wait, S1 was -sin(1) + cos(1), and S2 is sin(1) + cos(1). So adding them:

(-sin1 + cos1) + (sin1 + cos1) = 2 cos1

Thus, I = π √2 * 2 cos1 = 2√2 π cos(1)

Wait, that's a nice result! So the original integral I = 2√2 π cos(1)

But wait, let's verify the steps. The series expansion led us to I = π √2 (S1 + S2) = π √2 ( (-sin1 + cos1) + (sin1 + cos1) ) = π √2 (2 cos1) = 2√2 π cos1.

But let's check the numerical value. Compute 2√2 π cos(1):

√2 ≈ 1.4142, π ≈ 3.1416, cos(1) ≈ 0.5403.

So 2 * 1.4142 * 3.1416 * 0.5403 ≈ 2 * 1.4142 * 3.1416 * 0.5403 ≈ 2 * 1.4142 * 1.697 ≈ 2 * 2.400 ≈ 4.800.

But let's compute the numerical approximation to check. Let's compute the integral numerically to see if it's approximately 4.8.

Alternatively, let's compute 2√2 π cos(1):

2 * 1.41421356237 * 3.14159265359 * 0.54030230586 ≈

First, 2 * 1.41421356237 = 2.82842712474

Then, 2.82842712474 * 3.14159265359 ≈ 8.8857658763

Then, 8.8857658763 * 0.54030230586 ≈ 4.803

So approximately 4.803. Let's check with numerical integration.

But the original integral is ∫₀¹ x^{-3/4} (1 - x)^{-1/4} [1 - √(x(1 - x))]^{-2} dx.

Let me compute this numerically. Using a calculator or software, but since I can't compute here, but according to our analytical result, it's 2√2 π cos(1). Let's confirm the steps once more.

We expanded the denominator as a power series, swapped sum and integral, recognized each term as a Beta function, used Gamma reflection formula, split the series into even and odd terms, related them to sin and cos series, and combined to get 2√2 π cos(1). This seems correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2√2 π cos(1). Let's write this in LaTeX: 2\sqrt{2} \pi \cos(1)

Numerical approximation is approximately 4.8029513307, which rounds to 4.8029513307 when rounded to 10 decimal places. Let me compute it precisely:

cos(1) ≈ 0.54030230586

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

√2 ≈ 1.41421356237

So 2 * 1.41421356237 = 2.82842712474

2.82842712474 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 8.885765876316732

8.885765876316732 * 0.54030230586 ≈ 4.8030517655

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 4.8030517655 ≈ 4.8030517655, so 4.8030517655. Wait, let me compute more accurately:

Compute 2.8284271247461903 * 3.141592653589793 = 8.885765876316732

Then 8.885765876316732 * 0.5403023058681398:

Let's compute:

8.885765876316732 * 0.5 = 4.442882938158366

8.885765876316732 * 0.0403023058681398 ≈ 8.885765876316732 * 0.04 = 0.3554306350526693

Plus 8.885765876316732 * 0.0003023058681398 ≈ 0.002686

Total ≈ 0.3554306350526693 + 0.002686 ≈ 0.3581166350526693

So total ≈ 4.442882938158366 + 0.3581166350526693 ≈ 4.800999573211035

So approximately 4.8009995732, which rounds to 4.8009995732, which is approximately 4.8010 when rounded to 4 decimal places, but to 10 decimal places, it's 4.8009995732. Wait, but this contradicts the earlier approximation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Alternatively, use calculator:

2 * √2 * π * cos(1) ≈ 2 * 1.41421356237 * 3.14159265359 * 0.54030230586

First, multiply 2 and √2: 2.82842712474

Multiply by π: 2.82842712474 * 3.14159265359 ≈ 8.8857658763

Multiply by cos(1): 8.8857658763 * 0.54030230586 ≈ 4.8030517655

So approximately 4.8030517655. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 4.8030517655. So the numerical answer is approximately 4.8030517655.

But let's check with another method. Let's compute the integral using numerical integration. For example, using substitution x = sin^2θ, but I can't compute it here. However, the analytical result seems plausible, and the numerical approximation is around 4.8030517655.

Therefore, the final answer is 2√2 π cos(1) with numerical value approximately 4.8030517655.
