Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x - floor(1/x)) dx. Hmm, floor function integrals can be tricky because they involve piecewise behavior. Let me start by understanding the integrand.

The function inside the integral is 1/x minus the floor of 1/x. The floor function, floor(1/x), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So, if I let t = 1/x, then as x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from infinity to 1. But maybe changing variables could help here. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the integral into intervals where floor(1/x) is constant. For example, when x is in (1/(n+1), 1/n] for some integer n ≥ 1, then 1/x is in [n, n+1), so floor(1/x) = n. That seems right. So, the integrand 1/x - floor(1/x) would be 1/x - n on each interval (1/(n+1), 1/n]. Therefore, the integral can be expressed as a sum over n from 1 to infinity of the integral from 1/(n+1) to 1/n of (1/x - n) dx.

But the integral is from 0 to 1, so x approaches 0, which corresponds to n approaching infinity. So, the sum will be from n=1 to infinity. Let me write that.

So, the integral becomes the sum from n=1 to infinity of ∫_{1/(n+1)}^{1/n} (1/x - n) dx. Let's compute each integral in the sum.

First, compute the integral of 1/x dx, which is ln|x|, and the integral of n dx is n*x. So, evaluating from 1/(n+1) to 1/n:

For the first part, ln(1/n) - ln(1/(n+1)) = ln(n+1) - ln(n) = ln((n+1)/n) = ln(1 + 1/n).

For the second part, n*(1/n - 1/(n+1)) = n*( (n+1 - n)/(n(n+1)) ) = n*(1/(n(n+1))) = 1/(n+1).

So, each term in the sum is [ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1)].

Therefore, the entire integral is the sum from n=1 to infinity of [ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1)].

Hmm, now I need to compute this infinite sum. Let's see if we can find a telescoping series or recognize a known series.

First, note that ln(1 + 1/n) = ln(n+1) - ln(n). So, the sum becomes sum_{n=1}^∞ [ln(n+1) - ln(n) - 1/(n+1)].

If we split the sum into two parts: sum [ln(n+1) - ln(n)] minus sum [1/(n+1)].

The first sum is a telescoping series. Let's write out the first few terms:

For n=1: ln(2) - ln(1)
n=2: ln(3) - ln(2)
n=3: ln(4) - ln(3)
...
So, summing from n=1 to N, the sum would be ln(N+1) - ln(1) = ln(N+1). As N approaches infinity, this sum diverges to infinity. But wait, that can't be right because the original integral is from 0 to 1, which is a finite interval. But maybe the second sum also diverges, and their difference converges?

Wait, the second sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n+1) = sum_{k=2}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series minus 1, so it diverges. So we have an infinity minus infinity situation. That's problematic. But the original integral is finite, so there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me check the steps again. The integral is split into intervals (1/(n+1), 1/n], and the integral over each interval is [ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1)]. Then summing over n from 1 to infinity. But if the sum of ln(1 + 1/n) is divergent (since ln(1 + 1/n) ~ 1/n for large n, and sum 1/n diverges), but the sum of 1/(n+1) also diverges. However, perhaps the difference converges?

Indeed, ln(1 + 1/n) can be expanded as a Taylor series: ln(1 + 1/n) = 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + 1/(3n^3) - ... So, ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1) ≈ [1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ...] - [1/n - 1/n^2 + ...] = (1/n - 1/(n+1)) - 1/(2n^2) + ... Hmm, but 1/n - 1/(n+1) = 1/(n(n+1)), which is ~1/n^2. So, the leading term is 1/(n(n+1)) - 1/(2n^2) + ... which is O(1/n^2). Therefore, the terms are of order 1/n^2, so the sum converges.

Therefore, the sum sum_{n=1}^∞ [ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1)] is convergent. Let's compute it.

Let me write the sum as sum_{n=1}^∞ [ln(n+1) - ln(n) - 1/(n+1)].

Let’s denote S = sum_{n=1}^∞ [ln(n+1) - ln(n) - 1/(n+1)].

The sum of ln(n+1) - ln(n) from n=1 to N is ln(N+1) - ln(1) = ln(N+1).

The sum of 1/(n+1) from n=1 to N is sum_{k=2}^{N+1} 1/k = H_{N+1} - 1, where H_n is the nth harmonic number.

Therefore, S = lim_{N→∞} [ln(N+1) - (H_{N+1} - 1)].

But we know that H_n ~ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ..., where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. So, H_{N+1} ~ ln(N+1) + γ + 1/(2(N+1)) - ... 

Therefore, ln(N+1) - H_{N+1} + 1 ~ ln(N+1) - [ln(N+1) + γ + 1/(2(N+1))] + 1 = -γ - 1/(2(N+1)) + 1. As N approaches infinity, the term 1/(2(N+1)) goes to 0, so the limit is 1 - γ.

Therefore, S = 1 - γ.

So, the integral equals 1 - γ. That's the exact answer.

Now, the numerical approximation. The Euler-Mascheroni constant γ is approximately 0.5772156649. Therefore, 1 - γ ≈ 1 - 0.5772156649 = 0.4227843351. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.4227843351.

Let me verify this with a numerical check. For example, compute the integral numerically. Let's approximate the integral by summing over n from 1 to some large N, compute each integral term, and sum them up. Let's take N=1000.

Each term is [ln(1 + 1/n) - 1/(n+1)]. Summing from n=1 to 1000. Let's compute this:

But since we know the analytical result is 1 - γ ≈ 0.4227843351, and γ is approximately 0.5772156649, this seems correct. So the numerical approximation is about 0.4227843351.

Therefore, the final answer is 1 - γ, with numerical value approximately 0.4227843351.
