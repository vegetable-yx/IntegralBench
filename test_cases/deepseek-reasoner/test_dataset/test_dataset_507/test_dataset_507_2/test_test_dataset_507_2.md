Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 6 of the function x + (x - 3)^7 + sin(x - 3) dx. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. So I can split this into three separate integrals: the integral of x dx, the integral of (x - 3)^7 dx, and the integral of sin(x - 3) dx, all from 0 to 6. That should make it easier to handle each part individually.

Starting with the first term, the integral of x dx. The antiderivative of x is (1/2)x², right? So evaluating that from 0 to 6 would be (1/2)(6²) - (1/2)(0²) = 18 - 0 = 18. That part seems straightforward.

Next, the second term: integral of (x - 3)^7 dx. I think substitution would work here. Let me set u = x - 3, then du = dx. So the integral becomes u^7 du, which is (1/8)u^8 + C. Substituting back, that's (1/8)(x - 3)^8. Now, I need to evaluate this from 0 to 6. At x=6: (1/8)(6 - 3)^8 = (1/8)(3)^8. Let's calculate 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=81*81=6561. So (1/8)*6561 = 820.125. At x=0: (1/8)(0 - 3)^8 = (1/8)(-3)^8. Since the exponent is even, it's the same as 3^8, so also 820.125. Subtracting these: 820.125 - 820.125 = 0. Wait, that's zero? So the integral of (x - 3)^7 from 0 to 6 is zero? Hmm, that makes sense because the function (x - 3)^7 is symmetric around x=3 over the interval [0,6]. The area from 0 to 3 cancels out the area from 3 to 6 because it's an odd function shifted by 3. Wait, actually, (x - 3)^7 is an odd function around x=3. So integrating from 3 - 3 to 3 + 3 (i.e., 0 to 6) would result in zero. Yeah, that's correct. So that term contributes nothing. Okay, that's a good check.

Third term: integral of sin(x - 3) dx. Again, substitution. Let u = x - 3, du = dx. Integral becomes sin(u) du, which is -cos(u) + C. Substitute back: -cos(x - 3). Evaluate from 0 to 6. At x=6: -cos(6 - 3) = -cos(3). At x=0: -cos(0 - 3) = -cos(-3). But cosine is even, so cos(-3) = cos(3). So the integral becomes [-cos(3)] - [-cos(3)] = -cos(3) + cos(3) = 0. Wait, that's also zero? So the integral of sin(x - 3) from 0 to 6 is zero? Let me think. The function sin(x - 3) from 0 to 6 is a sine wave shifted by 3. The interval from 0 to 6 is symmetric around x=3. The integral over [0,6] of sin(x - 3) dx is the same as from -3 to 3 of sin(u) du. Since sin(u) is an odd function, the integral from -a to a is zero. So yes, that's correct. So the third term also cancels out.

So putting it all together, the entire integral is 18 (from the first term) + 0 (second term) + 0 (third term) = 18. So the exact answer is 18. Then the numerical approximation would just be 18.0000000000. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps.

Wait, the first integral: integral of x from 0 to 6 is indeed (1/2)(6)^2 - 0 = 18. Correct. The second integral, substitution u = x - 3, so when x=0, u=-3; x=6, u=3. So integral from u=-3 to u=3 of u^7 du. The function u^7 is odd, so the integral over symmetric limits is zero. Correct. Similarly, the sin(u) from u=-3 to u=3, which is also an odd function, so zero. So yes, all the other terms cancel out, leaving 18. So the exact answer is 18. Numerically, that's 18.0000000000. But maybe I should check with a numerical approximation just to be sure. Let me compute each part numerically.

First term: 18. Second term: integral from 0 to 6 of (x - 3)^7 dx. Let's compute it numerically. Let's take the antiderivative (1/8)(x - 3)^8 evaluated at 6 and 0. At 6: (1/8)(3)^8 = (1/8)*6561 = 820.125. At 0: (1/8)*(-3)^8 = same as 820.125. So 820.125 - 820.125 = 0. Correct. Third term: integral of sin(x - 3) from 0 to 6. Antiderivative is -cos(x - 3). At 6: -cos(3) ≈ -(-0.9899924966) ≈ 0.9899924966. Wait, wait, cos(3 radians) is approximately -0.9899924966. So -cos(3) is 0.9899924966. At x=0: -cos(-3) = -cos(3) = 0.9899924966. So the integral is 0.9899924966 - 0.9899924966 = 0. So yes, the third term is zero. So all together, 18 + 0 + 0 = 18. So the exact answer is 18, and the numerical is 18.0000000000. So the final answer should be 18. But let me check if I made any mistake in the integral of x. Wait, integral of x is (1/2)x², evaluated from 0 to 6: (1/2)(36) = 18. Correct. So everything checks out. Therefore, the exact answer is 18, and the numerical is 18.0000000000.
