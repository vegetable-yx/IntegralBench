Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 6 of the function x + (x - 3)^7 + sin(x - 3) dx. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. So I can split this into three separate integrals: the integral of x dx, the integral of (x - 3)^7 dx, and the integral of sin(x - 3) dx, all from 0 to 6. That should make it easier to handle each part individually.

Starting with the first term, the integral of x dx. The antiderivative of x is (1/2)xÂ². So evaluating from 0 to 6, that would be (1/2)(6)^2 - (1/2)(0)^2. 6 squared is 36, so (1/2)*36 is 18. The lower limit is 0, so that term is 0. So the first part is 18.

Next, the second term: integral of (x - 3)^7 dx. Hmm, substitution might be useful here. Let me set u = x - 3. Then du/dx = 1, so du = dx. The limits of integration will change when I substitute. When x is 0, u is -3, and when x is 6, u is 3. So the integral becomes the integral from u = -3 to u = 3 of u^7 du. The antiderivative of u^7 is (1/8)u^8. Evaluating from -3 to 3: (1/8)(3^8) - (1/8)(-3)^8. But wait, (-3)^8 is the same as 3^8 because any even power of a negative number is positive. So (1/8)(3^8) - (1/8)(3^8) equals zero. So the second integral cancels out to 0. That's interesting, the area under (x-3)^7 from -3 to 3 is zero because it's an odd function. So that term contributes nothing.

Third term: integral of sin(x - 3) dx. Again, substitution. Let u = x - 3, so du = dx. The limits when x=0, u=-3; x=6, u=3. So integral from -3 to 3 of sin(u) du. The antiderivative of sin(u) is -cos(u). So evaluating from -3 to 3: -cos(3) - (-cos(-3)). But cos(-3) is the same as cos(3) because cosine is an even function. So this becomes -cos(3) + cos(3) = 0. Wait, that's zero too? So the integral of sin(x-3) from 0 to 6 is zero? Hmm, that's right because over a symmetric interval around the shift (here, shifted by 3, but the interval from -3 to 3 is symmetric), the integral of an odd function (sin is odd) over symmetric limits is zero. So that term also cancels out.

So putting it all together, the total integral is 18 (from the first term) + 0 (second term) + 0 (third term) = 18. So the exact answer is 18. Then, the numerical approximation, since the exact answer is 18, the numerical value is just 18.0000000000. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me verify each step again. For the first integral, x from 0 to6: yes, (1/2)(6^2 - 0^2) = 18. Correct. The second integral: substitution, and since the function is odd and the interval is symmetric around 0 (after substitution), the integral is zero. Third integral: same reasoning, sin is odd, symmetric interval, integral zero. So yes, total is 18. So the numerical approximation is exactly 18.0000000000. So the JSON should be {"answer": "18", "numerical_answer": "18.0000000000"}.

But let me check if I made a mistake in substitution for the second integral. The original integral is from 0 to6 of (x-3)^7 dx. Let me compute it without substitution. The antiderivative of (x-3)^7 is (1/8)(x-3)^8. Evaluated from 0 to6: (1/8)(6-3)^8 - (1/8)(0-3)^8 = (1/8)(3^8) - (1/8)((-3)^8). Since (-3)^8 is 3^8, so (1/8)(3^8 - 3^8) = 0. So yes, correct. Similarly for the sin term: antiderivative is -cos(x-3) evaluated from 0 to6: -cos(3) + cos(-3) = -cos(3) + cos(3) =0. So all steps are correct. So the answer is 18.
