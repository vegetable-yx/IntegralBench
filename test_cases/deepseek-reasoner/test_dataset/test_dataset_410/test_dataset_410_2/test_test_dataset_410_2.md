Okay, I need to compute the definite integral of e^(-x²) cos(2x) from 0 to infinity. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving e^(-x²) often relate to the Gaussian integral, which is sqrt(π)/2. But here there's a cosine term, so maybe I need a different approach. Let me think.

One method for integrals with exponentials and trigonometric functions is to use integration by parts. Wait, but integrating e^(-x²) directly isn't straightforward because its antiderivative isn't elementary. Maybe another approach. Oh, right! Sometimes, using differentiation under the integral sign or switching to complex numbers can help. Let me recall.

Alternatively, I remember that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian involves another Gaussian. Since cos(2x) is part of the integrand, maybe this is related to the Fourier cosine transform of e^(-x²). The Fourier transform of e^(-a x²) is something like sqrt(π/a) e^(-ω²/(4a)), but I need to check the exact formula.

Let me write down the integral: ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} cos(2x) dx. Let's consider the general case ∫₀^∞ e^{-a x²} cos(b x) dx. If I can find a formula for this, then plug in a=1 and b=2.

I think the formula for this integral is (1/2) sqrt(π/a) e^{-b²/(4a)}. Let me verify that. Let's set I(a,b) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-a x²} cos(b x) dx. To compute this, maybe use differentiation with respect to b. Let's compute dI/db = -∫₀^∞ x e^{-a x²} sin(b x) dx. Hmm, integrating by parts here. Let u = sin(b x), dv = -x e^{-a x²} dx. Then du = b cos(b x) dx, and v = (1/(2a)) e^{-a x²}. Wait, integrating dv = -x e^{-a x²} dx, so v = (1/(2a)) e^{-a x²}. Then integration by parts gives uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du. The boundary terms: as x approaches infinity, e^{-a x²} goes to zero, and at x=0, sin(0)=0, so the first term is zero. Then we have -∫₀^∞ (1/(2a)) e^{-a x²} * b cos(b x) dx = -b/(2a) I(a,b). So dI/db = -b/(2a) I(a,b). That's a differential equation. Let's write it as dI/db = (-b/(2a)) I. This is a separable ODE. So dI/I = (-b/(2a)) db. Integrating both sides: ln I = -b²/(4a) + C. To find the constant C, consider when b=0. Then I(a,0) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-a x²} dx = (1/2) sqrt(π/a). So when b=0, ln I = ln( (1/2) sqrt(π/a) ). Therefore, the constant C is ln( (1/2) sqrt(π/a) ). Therefore, ln I = -b²/(4a) + ln( (1/2) sqrt(π/a) ). Exponentiating both sides: I = (1/2) sqrt(π/a) e^{-b²/(4a)}. So yes, the formula is correct.

Therefore, applying a=1 and b=2, the integral becomes (1/2) sqrt(π/1) e^{-(2)^2/(4*1)} = (sqrt(π)/2) e^{-4/4} = (sqrt(π)/2) e^{-1} = sqrt(π)/(2 e).

So the exact answer is sqrt(π)/(2 e). Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. We know that π ≈ 3.1415926536, e ≈ 2.7182818285. So sqrt(π) is approximately sqrt(3.1415926536) ≈ 1.7724538509. Then divide by 2e: 1.7182818285*2 ≈ 5.436563657, so 1.7724538509 / 5.436563657 ≈ 0.3261973457. Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, compute sqrt(π)/(2e):

sqrt(π) ≈ 1.7724538509055159

2e ≈ 5.43656365691809

Dividing them: 1.7724538509055159 / 5.43656365691809 ≈ 0.3261973033...

Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.3261973033. Wait, let me verify with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator for the integral. Let me check the numerical value. The exact value is sqrt(π)/(2e). Let me compute this:

sqrt(π) ≈ 1.7724538509055159

e ≈ 2.718281828459045

So 2e ≈ 5.43656365691809

Divide 1.7724538509055159 by 5.43656365691809:

1.7724538509055159 ÷ 5.43656365691809 ≈ 0.3261973033...

So approximately 0.3261973033. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, use numerical integration. But since we have the exact expression, the numerical value is sqrt(π)/(2e) ≈ 0.3261973033.

Therefore, the exact answer is sqrt(π)/(2e), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.3261973033.
