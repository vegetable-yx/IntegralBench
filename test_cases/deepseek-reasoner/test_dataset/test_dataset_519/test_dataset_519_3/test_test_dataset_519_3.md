Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to π/2 of cos(x)/(2 - cos²(x)) dx. Hmm, first, I should try to simplify the integrand or find a substitution that makes it easier. 

The denominator is 2 - cos²(x). Maybe I can use a substitution here. Let me think. If I let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. Wait, but the denominator is in terms of cos²(x). Alternatively, maybe express the denominator in terms of sin²(x). Since cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x), so 2 - cos²(x) = 2 - (1 - sin²(x)) = 1 + sin²(x). Oh, that's better! So the integral becomes cos(x)/(1 + sin²(x)) dx. 

Now, if I let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. Perfect! That substitution would work here. Let's try that. 

So substituting, when x is 0, u = sin(0) = 0. When x is π/2, u = sin(π/2) = 1. So the limits of integration change from 0 to 1. The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 1 of 1/(1 + u²) du. Wait, that's a standard integral. The integral of 1/(1 + u²) du is arctan(u) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1, it's arctan(1) - arctan(0). 

Arctan(1) is π/4 and arctan(0) is 0. So the exact value should be π/4. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly. 

Original integral: ∫₀^{π/2} cos(x)/(2 - cos²x) dx. Then, 2 - cos²x = 1 + sin²x. Then substitution u = sinx, du = cosx dx. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + u²) du. Which is [arctan(u)]₀¹ = arctan(1) - arctan(0) = π/4 - 0 = π/4. 

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method to be sure. Maybe using a different substitution. Let's see. Alternatively, could I have used a trigonometric identity? Let's see. The denominator is 2 - cos²x. Another approach: perhaps express in terms of tan(x/2) substitution. But that might complicate things. Let me try. 

Using the substitution t = tan(x/2). Then, cosx = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²), dx = 2/(1 + t²) dt. But this might not be necessary since the previous substitution worked. Let me check with the substitution again. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the denominator. Let me recheck. 2 - cos²x. Since cos²x = 1 - sin²x, so 2 - (1 - sin²x) = 2 -1 + sin²x = 1 + sin²x. Yes, that's correct. So substitution u = sinx, du = cosx dx. Then the integral becomes ∫ du/(1 + u²) from 0 to 1. So arctan(u) from 0 to 1. So π/4. 

Therefore, the exact answer is π/4. The numerical approximation would be approximately 0.7853981634. Let me confirm that. π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π/4 is about 0.7853981634. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7853981634. 

Wait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute the integral numerically. For example, using substitution. Alternatively, maybe split the integrand. Let me see. Alternatively, if I didn't use substitution, maybe integrate as follows. 

Original integrand: cosx/(2 - cos²x). Let me write 2 - cos²x as 1 + 1 - cos²x = 1 + sin²x. So same as before. So substitution u = sinx. So the same result. 

Alternatively, if I consider integrating by substitution t = cosx. Let's see. Then dt = -sinx dx. But the integrand is cosx/(2 - cos²x) dx. If t = cosx, then dt = -sinx dx. Hmm, but the integrand has cosx in the numerator. Let's see. 

So, ∫ cosx/(2 - t²) dx. But we need to express in terms of t. So, t = cosx, dt = -sinx dx. So, sinx dx = -dt. But the integrand is cosx/(2 - t²) dx. So, we have t/(2 - t²) dx.

But dx = -dt/sinx. But sinx = sqrt(1 - t²). So, dx = -dt/sqrt(1 - t²). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ t/(2 - t²) * (-dt)/sqrt(1 - t²). Hmm, that seems more complicated. So maybe that substitution isn't helpful. 

Therefore, the first method is better. So the exact answer is π/4. The numerical approximation is approximately 0.7853981634. 

Wait, but let me check with a numerical approximation using another approach. Let's compute the integral numerically. For example, using the original integrand. Let's compute the integral from 0 to π/2 of cosx/(2 - cos²x) dx. 

Let me pick some sample points. For x=0: cos(0)=1, denominator=2 -1=1, so integrand is 1/1=1. At x=π/2, cos(π/2)=0, integrand is 0. The function decreases from 1 to 0. The integral is the area under this curve. But since we know the exact answer is π/4≈0.7854, which is reasonable. 

Alternatively, if I use substitution u = tan(x), but that might not be necessary. 

Alternatively, maybe use substitution t = tan(u). Wait, but I think the first method is correct. Therefore, the exact answer is π/4, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7853981634. So the JSON output should be {"answer": "\\frac{\\pi}{4}", "numerical_answer": 0.7853981634}.
