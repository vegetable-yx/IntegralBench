Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 4 of {x}^4 dx, where {x} represents the fractional part of x. Hmm, let me recall what the fractional part function does. The fractional part of x is x minus the floor of x, right? So {x} = x - floor(x). That means for any real number x, {x} is the part after the decimal point. For example, if x is 2.5, then {x} is 0.5. If x is an integer, like 3, then {x} is 0.

Since the integral is from 0 to 4, I should consider how the fractional part behaves in this interval. The floor function increases by 1 at each integer. So between 0 and 1, floor(x) is 0, so {x} = x. Between 1 and 2, floor(x) is 1, so {x} = x - 1. Similarly, between 2 and 3, {x} = x - 2, and between 3 and 4, {x} = x - 3. At the integers themselves, the fractional part is 0.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 4 can be broken down into four integrals over each integer interval: from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4. Each of these intervals has a different expression for {x}, so I can compute each integral separately and then sum them up.

Let me write that out:

∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx = ∫₀¹ x⁴ dx + ∫₁² (x - 1)⁴ dx + ∫₂³ (x - 2)⁴ dx + ∫₃⁴ (x - 3)⁴ dx

Since each of these integrals is similar, just shifted by an integer, they should all evaluate to the same value. The integral of t⁴ from 0 to 1 is the same as the integral of (x - n)⁴ from n to n+1, where n is 0,1,2,3. Therefore, each of the four integrals is equal to ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt. So, if I compute one of them and multiply by 4, that should give the total.

Let me check that. Let's compute ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt. The antiderivative of t⁴ is (1/5)t⁵. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1/5)(1)^5 - (1/5)(0)^5 = 1/5. So each of the four intervals contributes 1/5. Therefore, the total integral would be 4*(1/5) = 4/5. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, no. Wait, the integral of {x}^4 from 0 to 4. Since {x} is periodic with period 1, the integral over each interval [n, n+1] is the same as over [0,1]. Therefore, the integral from 0 to 4 is 4 times the integral from 0 to 1 of t^4 dt. Which is indeed 4*(1/5) = 4/5. So the exact answer is 4/5, which is 0.8. But wait, let me check this because sometimes fractional parts can have different behaviors, but in this case, since the function is periodic and each interval is the same, integrating over each unit interval should give the same result.

But let me do it step by step to be sure. Let's compute each integral separately.

First interval: 0 to 1, {x} = x. So ∫₀¹ x⁴ dx = [x⁵/5]₀¹ = 1/5 - 0 = 1/5.

Second interval: 1 to 2, {x} = x - 1. Let u = x - 1, then when x=1, u=0; x=2, u=1. So ∫₁² (x - 1)^4 dx = ∫₀¹ u^4 du = 1/5.

Third interval: 2 to 3, {x} = x - 2. Similarly, substitution u = x - 2, same as above, integral becomes ∫₀¹ u^4 du = 1/5.

Fourth interval: 3 to 4, {x} = x - 3. Substitute u = x - 3, integral is ∫₀¹ u^4 du = 1/5.

Therefore, adding them up: 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 = 4/5. So the exact value is 4/5. Numerically, that's 0.8. So the numerical approximation would be 0.8, which is exact. But the problem says to round to 10 decimal places. 4/5 is 0.8 exactly, so the numerical approximation is 0.8000000000.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The integral of {x}^4 from 0 to 4. Since {x} is 0 at each integer, the function is continuous except at integers, but the integral is still the sum over each interval. So yes, each interval contributes 1/5, so total is 4/5. So exact answer is 4/5, numerical is 0.8. So the answer should be 4/5 in LaTeX and 0.8000000000.

But let me think again. Suppose I didn't use the periodicity. Let's compute each integral step by step.

First interval: 0 to 1, integral of x^4 is 1/5.

Second interval: 1 to 2, let's compute ∫₁² (x - 1)^4 dx. Let u = x - 1, du = dx. Limits from 0 to 1. So ∫₀¹ u^4 du = 1/5.

Third interval: 2 to 3, same substitution u = x - 2, integral is 1/5.

Fourth interval: 3 to 4, u = x - 3, integral is 1/5.

Total sum: 4*(1/5) = 4/5. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, the integral over [n, n+1] of {x}^k dx is 1/(k+1) for any integer n. So here, k=4, so each integral is 1/5, and over 4 intervals, 4/5. So the answer is 4/5. Therefore, the exact answer is 4/5, which is 0.8. So the numerical approximation is 0.8000000000.

Therefore, the final answer should be {"answer": "\frac{4}{5}", "numerical_answer": "0.8000000000"}.
