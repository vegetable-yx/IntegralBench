Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 4 of {x}^4 dx, where {x} represents the fractional part of x. Hmm, let me recall. The fractional part {x} is defined as x minus the floor of x, right? So, for any real number x, {x} = x - ⌊x⌋. That means between each integer, the fractional part resets. For example, from 0 to 1, {x} is just x, then from 1 to 2, it's x-1, and so on. Since the integral is from 0 to 4, I can break this integral into four intervals: [0,1), [1,2), [2,3), and [3,4). Each interval will have the fractional part function defined differently.

So, the integral becomes the sum of the integrals over each interval. Let me write that out:

∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx = ∫₀¹ x⁴ dx + ∫₁² (x-1)⁴ dx + ∫₂³ (x-2)⁴ dx + ∫₃⁴ (x-3)⁴ dx

Since each of these integrals is similar, just shifted by an integer. So each integral from n to n+1 of (x - n)^4 dx, where n is 0,1,2,3. Therefore, each of these integrals should be equal because the function {x}^4 is periodic with period 1. Wait, but actually, the function {x}^4 is the same on each interval [n, n+1), so integrating over a unit interval would give the same result each time. Therefore, the integral from 0 to 4 is just 4 times the integral from 0 to 1 of x^4 dx. Is that correct?

Wait, let me check. For example, the integral from 1 to 2 of (x-1)^4 dx is the same as the integral from 0 to 1 of t^4 dt if we substitute t = x -1. Similarly for the other intervals. So yes, each of the four integrals is equal to ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt. Therefore, the total integral is 4 * ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt.

Calculating ∫ t^4 dt from 0 to 1. The antiderivative of t^4 is (1/5)t^5. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1/5)(1)^5 - (1/5)(0)^5 = 1/5. Therefore, multiplying by 4 gives 4*(1/5) = 4/5. So the exact value is 4/5. But wait, wait. Let me verify this again. Let's compute each integral step by step.

First interval [0,1): {x} = x, so integral of x^4 from 0 to1 is [x^5/5] from 0 to1 = 1/5.

Second interval [1,2): {x} = x-1, so integral of (x-1)^4 from1 to2. Let u = x-1, then du=dx, limits from 0 to1. So integral becomes u^4 du from0 to1, which is again 1/5.

Same for the third interval [2,3): integral of (x-2)^4 dx from2 to3. Substitute u = x-2, same result 1/5.

Fourth interval [3,4): integral of (x-3)^4 dx from3 to4. Substitute u = x-3, again 1/5.

So total integral is 1/5 +1/5 +1/5 +1/5 = 4/5. So exact answer is 4/5. Then the numerical approximation is 0.8. But wait, 4/5 is exactly 0.8, so the numerical approximation is 0.8, which when rounded to 10 decimal places is 0.8000000000.

Wait, but let me check if there's a mistake here. The integral of {x}^4 from 0 to4. Since {x} is periodic with period 1, the integral over [0,4] is 4 times the integral over [0,1]. So yes, 4*(1/5) = 4/5. That seems straightforward.

But maybe I should verify with a different approach. Let's consider the general formula for the integral of {x}^n over [0, N], where N is an integer. I recall that ∫₀}^{N} {x}^n dx = N * ∫₀¹ t^n dt = N/(n+1). So for n=4 and N=4, it's 4/(4+1) = 4/5. So that's consistent. Therefore, the exact answer is 4/5, which is 0.8. So the numerical approximation is 0.8000000000.

Therefore, the final answer should be {"answer": "\\frac{4}{5}", "numerical_answer": "0.8000000000"}.
