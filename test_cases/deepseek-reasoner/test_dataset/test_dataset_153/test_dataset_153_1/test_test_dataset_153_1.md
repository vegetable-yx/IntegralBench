To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Recognize Key Functions**:
   - The term \(\ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right)\) is recognized as the inverse hyperbolic sine function, \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\).
   - The term \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) can be rewritten using the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, \(\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - By substituting \(x = \sinh(t)\) and recognizing the relationship between inverse hyperbolic functions, the integral simplifies to a form involving products of logarithmic terms and inverse hyperbolic functions.

3. **Integration by Recognition**:
   - The integrand is identified as a product of inverse hyperbolic functions and logarithmic terms that can be related to known integrals involving \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cosh^{-1}(1/x)\).

4. **Result from Integral Tables**:
   - The integral is recognized as a standard form that evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\) based on known results involving inverse hyperbolic functions and logarithmic integrals.

5. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\) is approximately \(0.6168502751\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
