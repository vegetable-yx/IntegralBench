Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of |1 + 2 sin x| from 0 to 2π. Hmm, integrating an absolute value function can be tricky because the expression inside the absolute value can change sign, which affects how we handle the integral. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with absolute values in integrals, the key is to find the points where the expression inside the absolute value equals zero. These points are the boundaries where the function changes from positive to negative or vice versa. So, I need to solve 1 + 2 sin x = 0 to find those critical points.

Let me solve 1 + 2 sin x = 0. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2 sin x = -1, so sin x = -1/2. The solutions to sin x = -1/2 in the interval [0, 2π) are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6. These are the points where the function inside the absolute value changes sign.

Now, I need to split the integral into intervals where the expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. So, from 0 to 7π/6, is 1 + 2 sin x positive or negative? Let me check a value in that interval. Let's take x = π/2. Then sin(π/2) = 1, so 1 + 2(1) = 3, which is positive. So between 0 and 7π/6, the expression is positive. Then between 7π/6 and 11π/6, it's negative because if I pick x = 3π/2, sin(3π/2) = -1, so 1 + 2(-1) = -1, but wait, 3π/2 is 3π/2 ≈ 4.712, which is between 7π/6 ≈ 3.665 and 11π/6 ≈ 5.759? Wait, no, 3π/2 is 4.712, which is between 7π/6 (≈3.665) and 11π/6 (≈5.759). So in that interval, the expression is negative. Then from 11π/6 to 2π, it's positive again. Let me check x = 2π, which is the same as x=0. At x=0, sin 0 = 0, so 1 + 0 = 1, positive. So yes, the intervals are [0,7π/6], [7π/6,11π/6], and [11π/6,2π].

Therefore, the integral becomes the sum of three integrals:

Integral from 0 to 7π/6 of (1 + 2 sin x) dx

Plus

Integral from 7π/6 to 11π/6 of -(1 + 2 sin x) dx

Plus

Integral from 11π/6 to 2π of (1 + 2 sin x) dx

So, let's compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 0 to 7π/6

The antiderivative of 1 is x, and the antiderivative of 2 sin x is -2 cos x. So the integral is [x - 2 cos x] evaluated from 0 to 7π/6.

Calculating at upper limit 7π/6:

7π/6 - 2 cos(7π/6)

cos(7π/6) is cos(π + π/6) = -cos(π/6) = -√3/2. So:

7π/6 - 2*(-√3/2) = 7π/6 + √3

At lower limit 0:

0 - 2 cos(0) = 0 - 2*1 = -2

So the first integral is (7π/6 + √3) - (-2) = 7π/6 + √3 + 2

Second integral: ∫-(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 7π/6 to 11π/6

This is the same as -∫(1 + 2 sin x) dx. The antiderivative is -[x - 2 cos x] evaluated from 7π/6 to 11π/6.

So, let's compute:

- [ (11π/6 - 2 cos(11π/6)) - (7π/6 - 2 cos(7π/6)) ]

First, cos(11π/6) is cos(2π - π/6) = cos(π/6) = √3/2. So:

11π/6 - 2*(√3/2) = 11π/6 - √3

Similarly, cos(7π/6) is -√3/2, so:

7π/6 - 2*(-√3/2) = 7π/6 + √3

Therefore, the expression inside the brackets is (11π/6 - √3) - (7π/6 + √3) = (11π/6 -7π/6) - √3 - √3 = (4π/6) - 2√3 = (2π/3) - 2√3

Multiply by -1:

- [ (2π/3 - 2√3) ] = -2π/3 + 2√3

So the second integral is -2π/3 + 2√3

Third integral: ∫(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 11π/6 to 2π

Again, antiderivative is x - 2 cos x. Evaluate from 11π/6 to 2π.

At upper limit 2π:

2π - 2 cos(2π) = 2π - 2*1 = 2π - 2

At lower limit 11π/6:

11π/6 - 2 cos(11π/6) = 11π/6 - 2*(√3/2) = 11π/6 - √3

So the third integral is (2π - 2) - (11π/6 - √3) = 2π - 2 -11π/6 + √3

Convert 2π to 12π/6 to combine terms:

12π/6 - 11π/6 = π/6, so π/6 - 2 + √3

So the third integral is π/6 - 2 + √3

Now, summing all three integrals:

First integral: 7π/6 + √3 + 2

Second integral: -2π/3 + 2√3

Third integral: π/6 - 2 + √3

Let's add them term by term.

First, the π terms:

7π/6 -2π/3 + π/6

Convert -2π/3 to -4π/6 to have common denominators:

7π/6 -4π/6 + π/6 = (7 -4 +1)π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3

Next, the constants:

2 -2 = 0

Then the √3 terms:

√3 + 2√3 + √3 = (1 + 2 +1)√3 = 4√3

So total integral is 2π/3 + 4√3

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, first integral: 7π/6 + √3 + 2

Second integral: -2π/3 + 2√3

Third integral: π/6 - 2 + √3

Wait, the third integral was π/6 - 2 + √3. So the constants are 2 (from first integral) -2 (from third integral) = 0. Wait, first integral has +2, third integral has -2. So 2 -2 = 0. Then the π terms: 7π/6 -2π/3 + π/6. Let's convert all to sixths:

7π/6 -4π/6 + π/6 = (7 -4 +1)π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3. Correct.

The √3 terms: first integral has +√3, second has +2√3, third has +√3. So total √3 terms: 1 +2 +1 =4, so 4√3.

So total integral is 2π/3 +4√3. That's the exact value.

Now, to compute the numerical approximation. Let's calculate 2π/3 +4√3.

First, π ≈3.1415926536, so 2π ≈6.2831853072, divided by 3: 6.2831853072 /3 ≈2.0943951024

√3 ≈1.7320508075688772, so 4√3 ≈6.928203230275509

Adding them together: 2.0943951024 +6.928203230275509 ≈9.022598332675509

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 9.0225983327

Wait, let me check the exact decimal places:

2.0943951024 +6.928203230275509

2.0943951024

+6.928203230275509

= 9.022598332675509

So, 9.0225983327 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2π/3 +4√3, and the numerical approximation is approximately 9.0225983327.

Let me verify once more the steps to ensure there's no mistake.

First, solving 1 +2 sin x =0 gives sin x = -1/2, which occurs at 7π/6 and 11π/6. Correct.

Then splitting the integral into three parts. Checked the sign in each interval, seems correct.

Calculating each integral:

First integral: [x -2 cos x] from 0 to7π/6. At 7π/6, cos is -√3/2, so -2*(-√3/2)=√3. So 7π/6 +√3 - (0 -2) =7π/6 +√3 +2. Correct.

Second integral: -[x -2 cos x] from7π/6 to11π/6. At 11π/6, cos is √3/2, so 11π/6 -2*(√3/2)=11π/6 -√3. At7π/6, 7π/6 -2*(-√3/2)=7π/6 +√3. So the integral is -[(11π/6 -√3) - (7π/6 +√3)] = -[ (11π/6 -√3 -7π/6 -√3) ]= -[ (4π/6 -2√3) ]= -2π/3 +2√3. Correct.

Third integral: [x -2 cos x] from11π/6 to2π. At2π, 2π -2*1=2π-2. At11π/6, 11π/6 -2*(√3/2)=11π/6 -√3. So the integral is (2π -2) - (11π/6 -√3)=2π -2 -11π/6 +√3. Convert 2π to12π/6, so12π/6 -11π/6=π/6. So π/6 -2 +√3. Correct.

Summing all parts:

π terms:7π/6 -2π/3 +π/6=7π/6 -4π/6 +π/6=4π/6=2π/3. Correct.

√3 terms:1 +2 +1=4. Correct.

Constants:2 -2=0. Correct.

So total integral is 2π/3 +4√3. Exact answer.

Numerical value:2π/3≈2.0943951024,4√3≈6.928203230275509. Sum≈9.022598332675509≈9.0225983327 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Everything checks out. So the final answer is correct.
