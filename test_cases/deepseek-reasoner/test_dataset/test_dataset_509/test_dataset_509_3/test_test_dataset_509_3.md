Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of |1 + 2 sin x| from 0 to 2π. Hmm, absolute values can complicate things because the expression inside might change sign over the interval. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when integrating an absolute value of a function, the key is to find the points where the function inside the absolute value equals zero. Those points will divide the interval into regions where the function is positive or negative, and I can remove the absolute value accordingly by considering the sign in each region.

So, let's start by finding where 1 + 2 sin x = 0. Solving for x:

1 + 2 sin x = 0  
=> sin x = -1/2

The solutions to sin x = -1/2 in the interval [0, 2π) are x = 7π/6 and x = 11π/6. These are the points where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign. Therefore, the integral can be split into three parts: from 0 to 7π/6, 7π/6 to 11π/6, and 11π/6 to 2π. But I need to check the sign of 1 + 2 sin x in each interval to know how the absolute value affects the integrand.

Let me test each interval:

1. From 0 to 7π/6: Let's pick x = π/2. Then sin(π/2) = 1, so 1 + 2(1) = 3, which is positive. Wait, but 7π/6 is 210 degrees, which is in the third quadrant where sin is negative. Wait, but between 0 and 7π/6, there's a point where sin x becomes negative. Wait, maybe I need to check more carefully.

Wait, sin x is positive in [0, π] and negative in [π, 2π]. But 7π/6 is in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2), so between 0 and 7π/6, sin x is positive from 0 to π, and negative from π to 7π/6. Hmm, but 1 + 2 sin x could be positive or negative in different parts. Wait, maybe I should check specific points in each interval.

Wait, the roots are at 7π/6 and 11π/6. So between 0 and 7π/6, let's check x = 0: 1 + 2 sin 0 = 1, which is positive. At x = π: sin π = 0, so 1 + 0 = 1, still positive. At x = 7π/6: sin(7π/6) = -1/2, so 1 + 2*(-1/2) = 0. So between 0 and 7π/6, the function 1 + 2 sin x is positive except at the endpoint 7π/6 where it's zero. Wait, but does it cross zero before 7π/6? Let me check at π/2: sin(π/2) = 1, so 1 + 2*1 = 3, which is positive. At 3π/2: sin(3π/2) = -1, so 1 + 2*(-1) = -1, but 3π/2 is 3π/2 ≈ 4.712, which is greater than 7π/6 ≈ 3.665. So between 0 and 7π/6, the function is positive. Then from 7π/6 to 11π/6, the function is negative, and from 11π/6 to 2π, it's positive again. Wait, let's check at x = 11π/6: sin(11π/6) = -1/2, so 1 + 2*(-1/2) = 0. Then, for x between 11π/6 and 2π, say x = 2π: sin(2π) = 0, so 1 + 0 = 1, positive. So the intervals where it's positive are [0,7π/6] and [11π/6,2π], and negative in between 7π/6 and 11π/6.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Integral from 0 to 7π/6 of (1 + 2 sin x) dx  
+ Integral from 7π/6 to 11π/6 of -(1 + 2 sin x) dx  
+ Integral from 11π/6 to 2π of (1 + 2 sin x) dx

So, let's compute each part separately.

First integral: ∫(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 0 to 7π/6  
Antiderivative is x - 2 cos x. Evaluated from 0 to 7π/6.

At 7π/6: 7π/6 - 2 cos(7π/6)  
cos(7π/6) = -√3/2, so 2 cos(7π/6) = -√3  
So 7π/6 - (-√3) = 7π/6 + √3

At 0: 0 - 2 cos(0) = 0 - 2*1 = -2

So first integral: (7π/6 + √3) - (-2) = 7π/6 + √3 + 2

Second integral: ∫-(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 7π/6 to 11π/6  
Which is ∫-1 - 2 sin x dx  
Antiderivative: -x + 2 cos x. Evaluated from 7π/6 to 11π/6.

At 11π/6: -11π/6 + 2 cos(11π/6)  
cos(11π/6) = √3/2, so 2 cos(11π/6)) = √3  
So -11π/6 + √3

At 7π/6: -7π/6 + 2 cos(7π/6)  
cos(7π/6) = -√3/2, so 2 cos(7π/6) = -√3  
So -7π/6 + (-√3) = -7π/6 - √3

So the second integral is [ -11π/6 + √3 ] - [ -7π/6 - √3 ]  
= (-11π/6 + √3) +7π/6 + √3  
= (-11π/6 +7π/6) + √3 + √3  
= (-4π/6) + 2√3  
= -2π/3 + 2√3

Third integral: ∫(1 + 2 sin x) dx from 11π/6 to 2π  
Antiderivative is x - 2 cos x. Evaluated from 11π/6 to 2π.

At 2π: 2π - 2 cos(2π) = 2π - 2*1 = 2π - 2

At 11π/6: 11π/6 - 2 cos(11π/6)  
cos(11π/6) = √3/2, so 2 cos(11π/6) = √3  
So 11π/6 - √3

Third integral: (2π - 2) - (11π/6 - √3)  
= 2π -2 -11π/6 + √3  
Convert 2π to 12π/6:  
= 12π/6 -11π/6 -2 + √3  
= π/6 -2 + √3

Now, sum all three integrals:

First integral: 7π/6 + √3 + 2  
Second integral: -2π/3 + 2√3  
Third integral: π/6 -2 + √3

Adding them together:

Let's collect the π terms:

7π/6 -2π/3 + π/6  
Convert to sixths:  
7π/6 -4π/6 + π/6 = (7 -4 +1)π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3

Now the constants:

2 -2 = 0

Now the √3 terms:

√3 + 2√3 + √3 = 4√3

So total integral is 2π/3 + 4√3

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, first integral: 7π/6 + √3 + 2  
Second integral: -2π/3 + 2√3  
Third integral: π/6 -2 + √3

Adding the terms:

π terms: 7π/6 + (-2π/3) + π/6  
Convert -2π/3 to -4π/6:  
7π/6 -4π/6 + π/6 = (7 -4 +1)π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3

Constant terms: 2 (from first) + (-2) (from third) = 0

√3 terms: √3 (first) + 2√3 (second) + √3 (third) = 4√3

So total integral is 2π/3 + 4√3. That's the exact value.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. Let's calculate 2π/3 and 4√3 separately.

First, 2π ≈ 6.283185307, so 2π/3 ≈ 6.283185307 / 3 ≈ 2.094395102

4√3: √3 ≈ 1.732050807, so 4*1.732050807 ≈ 6.928203228

Adding them together: 2.094395102 + 6.928203228 ≈ 9.02259833

Wait, but let me check with more decimal places to ensure accuracy.

Calculating 2π/3:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793  
2π ≈ 6.283185307179586  
2π/3 ≈ 6.283185307179586 / 3 ≈ 2.0943951023931953

4√3:

√3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772  
4*1.7320508075688772 ≈ 6.928203230275509

Adding them: 2.0943951023931953 + 6.928203230275509 ≈ 9.022598332668704

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 9.0225983327

Wait, let me check the exact decimal places:

2.0943951023931953  
+6.928203230275509  
= 2.0943951023931953 + 6.928203230275509  
= 9.0225983326687043

So, 9.0225983327 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2π/3 + 4√3, and the numerical approximation is approximately 9.0225983327.

Let me just verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in splitting the integral.

Original function: |1 + 2 sin x|. The roots at 7π/6 and 11π/6. So between 0 and 7π/6, positive; 7π/6 to 11π/6, negative; 11π/6 to 2π, positive. That's correct.

First integral from 0 to 7π/6: correct. Then the second integral with negative, and third again positive. The antiderivatives seem correct. The evaluation steps for each part also look correct. The combination of terms gives 2π/3 +4√3, which seems right.

Yes, I think that's correct.
