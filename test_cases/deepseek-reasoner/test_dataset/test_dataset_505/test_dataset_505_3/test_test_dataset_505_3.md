Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of sin(arccos(x)) dx. Hmm, first, maybe I can simplify the integrand. Arccos(x) is the angle whose cosine is x. So if θ = arccos(x), then cosθ = x. And sin(θ) would be the sine of that angle. Since cosθ = x, we can use the Pythagorean identity to find sinθ. The identity is sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sqrt(1 - x²). But wait, since θ is in the range of arccos, which is [0, π], sinθ is non-negative there. So sin(arccos(x)) simplifies to sqrt(1 - x²). That makes the integral ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 - x²) dx.

Oh right, that's a standard integral. The integral of sqrt(1 - x²) from 0 to 1 is the area of a quarter of a unit circle. Because the equation x² + y² = 1 represents a circle of radius 1, and integrating sqrt(1 - x²) from 0 to 1 gives the area in the first quadrant. So the area of a quarter-circle is (πr²)/4, and since r=1, it's π/4. But wait, let me verify that by actually computing the integral.

Let me do substitution. Let x = sinθ, then dx = cosθ dθ. When x=0, θ=0. When x=1, θ=π/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^(π/2) sqrt(1 - sin²θ) * cosθ dθ. But sqrt(1 - sin²θ) is cosθ, so the integral becomes ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ dθ. Then using the power-reduction formula: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) (1 + cos2θ) dθ. Integrating term by term: (1/2)[θ + (sin2θ)/2] from 0 to π/2. Plugging in π/2: (1/2)[π/2 + (sinπ)/2] = (1/2)(π/2 + 0) = π/4. At 0, it's (1/2)[0 + 0] = 0. So the integral is π/4. That's the exact value.

Numerically, π is approximately 3.1415926536, so π/4 is about 0.7853981634. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.7853981634. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, maybe using integration by parts. Let u = sqrt(1 - x²), dv = dx. Then du = (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, v = x. Integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. uv at 1 is 1*0 = 0, at 0 is 0. So it's - ∫₀¹ x*(-x)/sqrt(1 - x²) dx = ∫₀¹ x²/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Hmm, but that seems more complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me set t = 1 - x², then dt = -2x dx. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe express x² as (1 - (1 - x²)), so x²/sqrt(1 - x²) = (1 - (1 - x²))/sqrt(1 - x²) = 1/sqrt(1 - x²) - sqrt(1 - x²). Then the integral becomes ∫ (1/sqrt(1 - x²) - sqrt(1 - x²)) dx. The integral of 1/sqrt(1 - x²) is arcsin(x), and the integral of sqrt(1 - x²) we already know is (x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) + (1/2)arcsin(x)) + C. So putting it together: [arcsin(x) - (x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) - (1/2)arcsin(x))] from 0 to 1. Simplify: (1/2)arcsin(x) - (x/2)sqrt(1 - x²) evaluated from 0 to 1. At x=1: (1/2)(π/2) - (1/2)(0) = π/4. At x=0: (1/2)(0) - 0 = 0. So again, the result is π/4. So that confirms the same answer. Therefore, the exact answer is π/4, approximately 0.7853981634.
