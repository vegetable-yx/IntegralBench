Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of 1/(1 - x²) from -1/2 to 1/2. Hmm, first, I remember that the function 1/(1 - x²) can be integrated using partial fractions or maybe a standard antiderivative. Let me think. The integral of 1/(1 - x²) dx is a common one. Wait, isn't that related to inverse hyperbolic functions or logarithms?

Right, the integral of 1/(1 - x²) is (1/2) ln |(1 + x)/(1 - x)| + C, or alternatively, artanh(x) + C, since the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is another way to express it. Let me verify that. The derivative of artanh(x) is 1/(1 - x²), yes. So the antiderivative is artanh(x) + C. Alternatively, using logarithms, it can be written as (1/2) ln((1 + x)/(1 - x)) because artanh(x) = (1/2) ln((1 + x)/(1 - x)) for |x| < 1. Since our limits are from -1/2 to 1/2, which is within the domain where the function is defined (since 1 - x² is positive there), that's good.

So, the definite integral from -1/2 to 1/2 would be artanh(1/2) - artanh(-1/2). But artanh is an odd function, right? Because hyperbolic tangent is odd, so its inverse should also be odd. So artanh(-x) = -artanh(x). Therefore, artanh(-1/2) = -artanh(1/2). So the integral becomes artanh(1/2) - (-artanh(1/2)) = 2 artanh(1/2).

Alternatively, using the logarithmic form, it would be (1/2) [ln((1 + 1/2)/(1 - 1/2)) - ln((1 + (-1/2))/(1 - (-1/2)))]. Let me compute that. Let's do both ways to check.

First, using the logarithmic form. The antiderivative evaluated at 1/2 is (1/2) ln((1 + 1/2)/(1 - 1/2)) = (1/2) ln((3/2)/(1/2)) = (1/2) ln(3). At -1/2, it's (1/2) ln((1 - 1/2)/(1 + 1/2)) = (1/2) ln((1/2)/(3/2)) = (1/2) ln(1/3) = (1/2)(-ln 3). So subtracting, we get (1/2 ln 3) - (1/2 (-ln 3)) = (1/2 ln 3) + (1/2 ln 3) = ln 3. Wait, that's interesting. So the integral from -1/2 to 1/2 of 1/(1 - x²) dx is ln 3. Let me check that again.

Wait, if I use the artanh approach: 2 artanh(1/2). What's artanh(1/2)? Let's compute that. artanh(x) = (1/2) ln((1 + x)/(1 - x)). So plugging x = 1/2: (1/2) ln((3/2)/(1/2)) = (1/2) ln(3) as before. So 2 * (1/2) ln 3 = ln 3. So that's correct. Therefore, the exact value is ln 3.

Alternatively, maybe I can use partial fractions. Let's try that method to confirm. The integrand 1/(1 - x²) can be written as A/(1 - x) + B/(1 + x). Let's find A and B. 1 = A(1 + x) + B(1 - x). Let x = 1: 1 = A(2) + B(0) => A = 1/2. Let x = -1: 1 = A(0) + B(2) => B = 1/2. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ [1/(1 + x) + 1/(1 - x)] dx. Integrating term by term: (1/2)[ln|1 + x| - ln|1 - x|] + C. Which is the same as (1/2) ln|(1 + x)/(1 - x)| + C, which matches the previous result. So evaluating from -1/2 to 1/2:

At upper limit 1/2: (1/2) ln( (1 + 1/2)/(1 - 1/2) ) = (1/2) ln(3/2 / 1/2) = (1/2) ln(3).

At lower limit -1/2: (1/2) ln( (1 + (-1/2))/(1 - (-1/2)) ) = (1/2) ln( (1/2)/(3/2) ) = (1/2) ln(1/3) = (1/2)(-ln 3).

Subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit: (1/2 ln 3) - ( -1/2 ln 3 ) = (1/2 + 1/2) ln 3 = ln 3. So that's the exact answer.

Now, the numerical approximation. We need to compute ln(3) and round it to 10 decimal places. Let me recall that ln(3) is approximately 1.098612288668... So rounding to 10 decimal places would be 1.0986122887. Let me verify with a calculator. Yes, ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098..., so the 10th decimal place is the 8th digit after the decimal, which is 6, followed by 6, 8, 6, 0, etc. Wait, wait, let me count:

1.0986122886 (10 decimal places: 0,9,8,6,1,2,2,8,8,6). Wait, no. Wait, the number is 1.0986122886681098...

Breaking it down:

1.0986122886 681098...

So up to 10 decimal places: 1.0986122886 (the 10 decimals are 0,9,8,6,1,2,2,8,8,6). Wait, but the next digit after the 10th is 6, which is the 11th decimal. So the 10th is 6, and since the next digit is 6 (>=5), we round up the 6 to 7. Wait, but wait, let's check:

Wait, ln(3) ≈ 1.098612288668109691395245...

So the exact decimal expansion:

1.0986122886 68109691395245...

So the first 10 decimal places: 0,9,8,6,1,2,2,8,8,6 (positions 1 to 10). The 11th decimal is 6. So when we round to 10 decimal places, we look at the 11th, which is 6. Since 6 >=5, we round up the 10th decimal from 6 to 7. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 1.0986122887.

Wait, but let me confirm with a calculator. Let me check:

Using a calculator, ln(3) is approximately 1.0986122886681098. So up to 10 decimal places:

1.0986122886 (first 10 decimals) and the 11th is 6. So 1.0986122886 (6) → rounded to 10 decimals, since the 11th digit is 6, we add 1 to the 10th decimal. So 6 becomes 7. Therefore, 1.0986122887.

Yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is ln(3), which in LaTeX is \ln 3, but maybe boxed as \boxed{\ln 3}. The numerical approximation is approximately 1.0986122887.

Wait, but let me check once more. Let me compute the integral numerically using another method. For example, the integral from -0.5 to 0.5 of 1/(1 - x²) dx. Let's approximate it numerically. Since the function is even (symmetric about y-axis), the integral from -a to a is twice the integral from 0 to a. So 2 * ∫ from 0 to 0.5 of 1/(1 - x²) dx. Let's compute that numerically. The antiderivative at 0.5 is artanh(0.5) ≈ 0.5493061443, so 2 * 0.5493061443 ≈ 1.0986122886, which matches ln(3). So the numerical value is indeed approximately 1.0986122887 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the final answer is exact: ln(3), numerical: 1.0986122887.
