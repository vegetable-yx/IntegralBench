Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from e to e^e of (log x * log(log x))/x dx. Hmm, first, I should recall some integration techniques. The integrand has log x and log(log x) multiplied together, and there's a 1/x term. That structure might suggest substitution.

Let me think about substitution. If I let u be the inner function of the logarithm. Wait, log(log x) is part of the integrand. Maybe set u = log x. Then du would be 1/x dx, which is present in the integrand. Let's try that.

So, let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. That means the integral becomes x du, but since we have 1/x dx, that's just du. So substituting, when x = e, u = log e = 1. When x = e^e, u = log(e^e) = e. So the limits of integration become from u=1 to u=e.

Now, the integrand is log x * log(log x) / x dx, which with substitution becomes u * log(u) * du. Because log x is u, and log(log x) is log(u), and 1/x dx is du. So the integral simplifies to the integral from 1 to e of u * log(u) du.

Wait, but integrating u * log(u) du. Hmm, that's a product of two functions, so maybe integration by parts. Let me recall: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me set one part as log(u) and the other as u du. Wait, but here the integrand is u * log(u) du. Let me set v = log(u), then dv = (1/u) du. Then the other part would be u du, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe set t = log(u), but perhaps another substitution.

Wait, let's try integration by parts. Let me set:

Let’s let t = log(u), so that dt = (1/u) du. Wait, but the integrand is u * t. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me set:

Let’s let’s do integration by parts where we let the first function be log(u) and the second be u. So:

Let’s set:

Let’s let v = log(u), dw = u du. Then dv = (1/u) du, and w = (1/2)u². Wait, that might work. So integration by parts:

∫v dw = v w - ∫w dv

So ∫ log(u) * u du = (log(u) * (1/2)u²) - ∫ (1/2)u² * (1/u) du

Wait, that would be (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/2) ∫ u du

Because the second integral is (1/2) ∫ u² * (1/u) du = (1/2) ∫ u du.

So that simplifies to (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/2)*(1/2)u² + C

Which is (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/4)u² + C

Therefore, the integral from 1 to e of u log(u) du is [ (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/4)u² ] evaluated from 1 to e.

Let me compute that. First, upper limit e:

(1/2)(e²) log(e) - (1/4)e². Since log(e) is 1, so that's (1/2)e² *1 - (1/4)e² = (1/2 - 1/4)e² = (1/4)e².

Lower limit 1:

(1/2)(1²) log(1) - (1/4)(1²). log(1) is 0, so that term is 0, and the second term is -1/4.

So subtracting lower limit from upper limit:

(1/4)e² - (-1/4) = (1/4)e² + 1/4 = (e² + 1)/4.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. The upper limit gives (1/4)e², and the lower limit gives 0 - 1/4 = -1/4. So when we take upper minus lower, it's (1/4)e² - (-1/4) = (1/4)e² + 1/4. Which is (e² +1)/4. So the integral from 1 to e of u log(u) du is (e² +1)/4.

But wait, that seems a bit of a jump. Let me verify the integration by parts again. Let me redo the steps:

∫ u log(u) du

Let’s set v = log(u), dv = (1/u) du

Let dw = u du, so w = (1/2)u²

Then integration by parts gives:

v w - ∫ w dv = log(u)*(1/2)u² - ∫ (1/2)u²*(1/u) du

Simplify the integral:

= (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/2) ∫ u du

= (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/2)*(1/2)u² + C

= (1/2)u² log(u) - (1/4)u² + C

Yes, that's correct. Then evaluating from 1 to e:

At e:

(1/2)e² *1 - (1/4)e² = (1/2 - 1/4)e² = (1/4)e²

At 1:

(1/2)(1)^2 *0 - (1/4)(1)^2 = 0 - 1/4 = -1/4

So subtracting: (1/4)e² - (-1/4) = (1/4)e² + 1/4 = (e² +1)/4

So the integral from e to e^e of (log x * log(log x))/x dx is (e² +1)/4.

Wait, but let me check the substitution again. The original integral was from x=e to x=e^e. We substituted u = log x, so when x=e, u=1; when x=e^e, u=e. Then the integral became ∫ from 1 to e of u log u du, which we computed as (e² +1)/4. So that's the exact answer.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. The exact answer is (e² +1)/4. Let's compute e² first. e is approximately 2.718281828459045. So e squared is approximately (2.718281828459045)^2. Let me calculate that:

2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

First, 2.71828 * 2.71828. Let's compute:

2 * 2.71828 = 5.43656

0.7 * 2.71828 = 1.902796

0.01 * 2.71828 = 0.0271828

0.008 * 2.71828 = 0.02174624

0.00028 * 2.71828 ≈ 0.0007611184

Adding up:

5.43656 + 1.902796 = 7.339356

7.339356 + 0.0271828 = 7.3665388

7.3665388 + 0.02174624 = 7.38828504

7.38828504 + 0.0007611184 ≈ 7.3890461584

So e² ≈ 7.389056096 (since more accurately, e^2 is approximately 7.389056096...). So e² +1 is approximately 8.389056096. Then divide by 4: 8.389056096 /4 ≈ 2.097264024.

So the numerical approximation is approximately 2.097264024, which when rounded to 10 decimal places would be 2.0972640240. Wait, but let me check with a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, e^2.718281828459045, so e squared is e * e. Let me compute more accurately:

e ≈ 2.718281828459045

e squared:

2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

Using a calculator, e² is approximately 7.389056098930649. So e² +1 is 8.389056098930649. Divided by 4: 8.389056098930649 /4 ≈ 2.097264024732662. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 2.0972640247. So 2.0972640247. But let's check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator. Let me check e^2:

e ≈ 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995...

e² ≈ 7.38905609893065022723042746057500781318031557055184...

So e² +1 ≈ 8.38905609893065022723042746057500781318031557055184...

Divided by 4: 8.38905609893065022723042746057500781318031557055184... /4 ≈ 2.09726402473266255680760686514375195329507889263796...

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 2.0972640247. So 2.0972640247. But when rounding, the 11th decimal is 3, which is less than 5, so we keep the 10th as is. Wait, let's see:

The number is 2.097264024732662...

Breaking it down:

2.0972640247 (32662...)

So up to 10 decimal places: 2.0972640247. But the 10th decimal is the 7, and the next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. So the numerical approximation is 2.0972640247.

Wait, but maybe the exact value is (e² +1)/4. Let me confirm once again the steps. The substitution was correct, and the integration by parts was done properly. So the exact answer is (e² +1)/4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is approximately 2.0972640247.

So the final answer in JSON should be {"answer": "\boxed{\dfrac{e^2 + 1}{4}}", "numerical_answer": 2.0972640247}
