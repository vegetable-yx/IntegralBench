Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from e to e^e of (log x * log(log x))/x dx. Hmm, first, I should recall some integration techniques. The integrand has log x and log(log x) multiplied together, and there's a 1/x term. That structure might suggest substitution.

Let me think about substitution. If I let u be the inner function. Let's try u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. That's good because the integrand has a 1/x dx term. So substituting, when x = e, u = log e = 1. When x = e^e, u = log(e^e) = e. So the limits of integration become from u=1 to u=e.

Then the integrand becomes log x ) * log(log x ) * (1/x dx) which with substitution is u * log u * du. Because log x is u, and log(log x) is log u. So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to e of u * log u du.

Now, I need to compute ∫ u * log u du. This looks like integration by parts. Let me set: Let’s let v = log u, dv = (1/u) du. Then dw = u du, so w = (1/2)u². Wait, wait, no. Wait, integration by parts formula is ∫v dw = v w - ∫w dv. Wait, maybe I should set it as:

Let’s set t = log u, and then dt = (1/u) du. But maybe better to use integration by parts. Let me set:

Let’s let t = log u, so that dt = (1/u) du. Then the remaining part is u * du. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let me set:

Let’s let v = log u, and dw = u du. Then dv = (1/u) du, and w = (1/2)u². Then integration by parts gives:

∫ v dw = v w - ∫ w dv = log u * (1/2 u²) - ∫ (1/2 u²) * (1/u) du

Simplify that: (1/2) u² log u - (1/2) ∫ u du

The integral of u du is (1/2) u², so:

(1/2) u² log u - (1/2)*(1/2) u² + C

Which simplifies to (1/2) u² log u - (1/4) u² + C

So the definite integral from 1 to e is:

[ (1/2) e² log e - (1/4) e² ] - [ (1/2)(1)² log 1 - (1/4)(1)² ]

Since log e is 1, and log 1 is 0. So first term at upper limit e:

(1/2 e² * 1) - (1/4 e²) = (1/2 e² - 1/4 e²) = (1/4 e²)

At lower limit 1:

(1/2 *1 *0) - (1/4 *1) = -1/4

So the total integral is (1/4 e² - (-1/4)) = (1/4 e² + 1/4) = (e² + 1)/4

Wait, but wait. Let me check the substitution again. Wait, the substitution was u = log x, so when x goes from e to e^e, u goes from 1 to e. Then the integral becomes ∫₁^e u log u du. Then we did integration by parts and got (1/2 u² log u - 1/4 u²) evaluated from 1 to e.

At u = e: (1/2 e² * 1) - (1/4 e²) = (1/2 - 1/4)e² = (1/4)e²

At u =1: (1/2 *1² *0) - (1/4 *1²) = -1/4

So subtracting: (1/4 e²) - (-1/4) = 1/4 e² + 1/4 = (e² +1)/4

So the exact answer is (e² +1)/4. Let me check that again. Wait, but when I did the integration by parts, the integral of u log u du is (1/2 u² log u - 1/4 u²). So evaluated from 1 to e, that's correct.

So the exact answer is (e² +1)/4. Then the numerical approximation. Let's compute e ≈ 2.718281828459045. Then e squared is e*e ≈ 7.389056098930649. Then e² +1 ≈ 8.389056098930649. Divided by 4: 8.389056098930649 /4 ≈ 2.097264024732662. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 2.0972640247.

Wait, let me check the exact calculation. Let me compute e^2:

e ≈ 2.718281828459045

e squared: 2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

Let me compute that:

2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

First, 2.71828 * 2.71828. Let's compute step by step:

2.71828 * 2.71828 = (2 + 0.71828)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*0.71828 + (0.71828)^2 = 4 + 2.87312 + 0.515966 = 4 + 2.87312 = 6.87312 + 0.515966 ≈ 7.389086. But more accurately, using calculator:

e^2 ≈ 7.389056098930649

So e² +1 = 8.389056098930649

Divide by 4: 8.389056098930649 /4 = 2.0972640247326623

So rounded to 10 decimal places: 2.0972640247

So the exact answer is (e² +1)/4, and the numerical is approximately 2.0972640247.

Wait, the integral was from e to e^e, but after substitution, the limits became 1 to e. So the substitution was correct. Let me confirm once again.

Original integral: ∫_{e}^{e^e} [ (ln x) * (ln x) / x ] dx

Let u = ln x, so du = (1/x) dx. Then when x = e, u = 1. When x = e^e, u = e. So the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{e} u * ln u * du. Then integrating that gives (1/4)(e² +1). So yes, the exact answer is (e² +1)/4.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{e^2 + 1}{4}} and the numerical is approximately 2.0972640247.
