Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to infinity of x^(2-1) e^(-1.0x²) H_2(1.0x) dx. Hmm, first, let me parse this. The integrand is x^(2-1), which is just x, multiplied by e^{-x²} (since 1.0x² is x²) and the Hermite polynomial H_2(1.0x). Wait, H_2 is the second Hermite polynomial. Let me recall the definition of Hermite polynomials. The physicists' Hermite polynomials are given by H_n(x), and they satisfy H_n(x) = (-1)^n e^{x²} d^n/dx^n e^{-x²}. For n=2, H_2(x) = 4x² - 2. Let me confirm that. Yes, H_0(x)=1, H_1(x)=2x, H_2(x)=4x² - 2. So H_2(1.0x) would be 4(1.0x)^2 - 2 = 4x² - 2. So substituting that into the integral, the integrand becomes x * e^{-x²} * (4x² - 2). Therefore, the integral is ∫₀^∞ x(4x² - 2) e^{-x²} dx. Let me write that out: ∫₀^∞ (4x³ - 2x) e^{-x²} dx.

Now, I can split this into two integrals: 4∫₀^∞ x³ e^{-x²} dx - 2∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} dx. Let's compute each integral separately. 

First, the integral of x e^{-x²} dx from 0 to ∞. Let me recall that ∫ x e^{-x²} dx is a standard integral. Let’s make substitution u = x², then du = 2x dx, so (1/2) du = x dx. The integral becomes (1/2) ∫ e^{-u} du from u=0 to u=∞, which is (1/2)( -e^{-u} ) from 0 to ∞. Evaluating, at ∞, e^{-u} is 0, and at 0, it's -1. So (1/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1/2. So ∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} dx = 1/2. Therefore, the second term is -2*(1/2) = -1.

Now, the first integral: 4∫₀^∞ x³ e^{-x²} dx. Let's compute ∫ x³ e^{-x²} dx. Again, substitution. Let u = x², then du = 2x dx, so x² = u, and x³ dx = x² * x dx = u * (du/2). So the integral becomes ∫ u * (du/2) e^{-u} from u=0 to ∞. That's (1/2) ∫₀^∞ u e^{-u} du. The integral of u e^{-u} du is Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So (1/2)*1! = 1/2. Therefore, 4*(1/2) = 2.

So combining both terms: 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, the integral is 1. 

Wait, let me check that again. The first integral was 4*(1/2) = 2, and the second term is -2*(1/2) = -1. So 2 -1 =1. That seems straightforward. 

But let me verify using another method. Maybe using gamma functions. The general integral ∫₀^∞ x^{n} e^{-a x²} dx is (1/(2 a^{(n+1)/2})) Γ((n+1)/2). Let's check that. For the first integral, n=3, a=1. So (1/(2*1^{2})) Γ(2) = (1/2)(1!) = 1/2. Multiply by 4: 4*(1/2)=2. For the second integral, n=1, a=1. (1/(2*1^{1})) Γ(1) = (1/2)(0!) = 1/2. Multiply by -2: -1. So total 1. So that's consistent. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 1. Numerically, that's 1.0000000000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the original integral was H_2(1.0x). So H_2(1.0x) is 4(1.0x)^2 - 2 = 4x² - 2, correct. Then the integrand is x*(4x² -2)*e^{-x²}. So expanding, 4x³ e^{-x²} - 2x e^{-x²}. Integrate term by term. The first term, 4x³ e^{-x²} from 0 to ∞. The integral of x³ e^{-x²} is (1/2)Γ(2) = 1/2, so 4*(1/2)=2. The second term, -2x e^{-x²}, integral is -2*(1/2)= -1. So total 2-1=1. So exact answer is 1, numerical is 1.0. 

But wait, maybe I should be careful with the Hermite polynomials. Let me confirm H_2(x). The physicists' Hermite polynomials are indeed H_0(x)=1, H_1(x)=2x, H_2(x)=4x² - 2. So substituting x with 1.0x, which is just x, so H_2(x) = 4x² - 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the integrand is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a more general formula for integrals involving Hermite polynomials multiplied by exponentials. Let me recall that. The integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ H_n(x) e^{-x²} dx. But here, the limits are from 0 to ∞, and we have an additional x. Wait, in our case, the integral is from 0 to ∞, and the integrand is x H_2(x) e^{-x²}. But H_2(x) is even or odd? H_n(x) is even if n even, odd if n odd. H_2(x) is 4x² -2, which is even. So x*H_2(x) is x*(even) = odd function. But integrating from 0 to ∞, so we can write the integral as (1/2) ∫_{-∞}^∞ x H_2(x) e^{-x²} dx. But since x H_2(x) is odd, the integral over the entire real line would be zero. But we are integrating from 0 to ∞, so the integral is half of the integral from -infty to infty, but since the integrand is odd, the integral from -infty to infty is zero, so the integral from 0 to infty would be (1/2)*0 = 0? Wait, but that contradicts our previous result. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me check.

Wait, H_2(x) is even, so x*H_2(x) is x*(even) = odd function. Therefore, the integral over the entire real line of an odd function is zero. But our integral is from 0 to ∞. So if the integrand is odd, then the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to the integral from -infty to 0. But since the function is odd, the integral from -infty to 0 is the negative of the integral from 0 to ∞. Therefore, the total integral from -infty to ∞ is zero, which implies that the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to the negative of the integral from -infty to 0, which would mean that the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to half of the integral from -infty to ∞ only if the function is even. But here, the function is odd, so the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to (1/2) times the integral from -infty to ∞ only if the function is even. Since our integrand is odd, the integral from 0 to ∞ is not half of the total integral. Instead, the total integral is zero, so the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to the negative of the integral from -infty to 0. But since the function is odd, the integral from -infty to 0 is equal to the negative of the integral from 0 to ∞. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = -∫₀^∞ f(x) dx. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^∞ f(x) dx = ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx + ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = -∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0. So that's correct. Therefore, the integral from 0 to ∞ is not zero, but the integral over the entire real line is zero. So our previous calculation gave 1, but according to this, if the integral over the entire real line is zero, then the integral from 0 to ∞ would be the negative of the integral from -infty to 0. But how does that reconcile with our previous result of 1?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The integrand is x*H_2(x)*e^{-x²}. H_2(x) is 4x² -2, so x*(4x² -2) e^{-x²} = (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²}. Let's an odd function because 4x³ is odd, 2x is odd, and e^{-x²} is even. So odd*even = odd. So the entire integrand is odd. Therefore, integrating from -infty to infty gives zero. But our integral is from 0 to infty. So if the integrand is odd, then ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = -∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx. But since the function is odd, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = -∫₀^∞ f(-x) dx. But f(-x) = -f(x), so ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = -∫₀^∞ (-f(x)) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx. But then ∫_{-infty}^∞ f(x) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx. But we know that ∫_{-infty}^∞ f(x) dx = 0, so 2 ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0 => ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0. But this contradicts our previous result of 1. So where is the mistake?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine. The integrand is (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²}. Let's check if this is an odd function. Let's substitute x with -x. For x³: (-x)^3 = -x³, and (-x) = -x. So 4*(-x)^3 -2*(-x) = -4x³ +2x. Multiply by e^{-(-x)^2} = e^{-x²}. So the entire function at -x is (-4x³ +2x) e^{-x²} = - (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²} = -f(x). Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x), so the function is indeed odd. Therefore, the integral over the entire real line is zero. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = -∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx. But since f is odd, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫_{infty}^0 f(-y) (-dy) ) (substitute y = -x). So ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫_{0}^infty f(-y) (-dy) ) = ∫₀^∞ -f(y) (-dy) ) = ∫₀^∞ f(y) dy. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(y) dy. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^∞ f(x) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx + ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx. But since the integral over the entire real line is zero, 2 ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0 => ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0. But this contradicts our previous calculation where we found the integral to be 1. So where is the mistake?

Wait, this is a problem. There must be a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check the calculation again. Let's compute the integral ∫₀^∞ (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²} dx. Let's compute each term separately. First term: 4∫₀^∞ x³ e^{-x²} dx. Let me compute this. Let u = x², then du = 2x dx, so x³ dx = x² * x dx = u * (du/2). So ∫ x³ e^{-x²} dx = ∫ u e^{-u} (du/2) from u=0 to ∞. That's (1/2) ∫₀^∞ u e^{-u} du = (1/2) Γ(2) = (1/2)(1!) = 1/2. So 4*(1/2) = 2. Second term: -2 ∫₀^∞ x e^{-x²} dx. Let u = x², du = 2x dx, so ∫ x e^{-x²} dx = (1/2) ∫ e^{-u} du = (1/2)(-e^{-u}) from 0 to ∞ = (1/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1/2. So -2*(1/2) = -1. So total integral is 2 -1 =1. But according to the symmetry argument, the integral should be zero. But this is a contradiction. So where is the mistake?

Wait, the symmetry argument says that the integral over the entire real line is zero, but our integral is from 0 to ∞. However, the function is odd, so the integral from 0 to ∞ should be equal to the negative of the integral from -∞ to 0. But if the integral over the entire real line is zero, then ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = -∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx. But since the function is odd, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫_{0}^0 f(-y) (-dy) = ∫₀}^∞ -f(y) (-dy) = ∫₀^∞ f(y) dy. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = -∫₀^∞ f(y) dy. Which implies that ∫₀^∞ f(x) dx = 0. But according to our direct calculation, it's 1. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the steps must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is not an odd function? Let me check again. The integrand is x*H_2(x)*e^{-x²}. H_2(x) is 4x² -2. So x*(4x² -2) e^{-x²} = (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²}. Let's check if this is odd. Replace x with -x: (4*(-x)^3 -2*(-x)) e^{-x²} = (-4x³ +2x) e^{-x²} = - (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²} = -f(x). So yes, it's odd. Therefore, the integral from -infty to infty is zero. But our integral is from 0 to infty. So according to symmetry, ∫₀^infty f(x) dx = -∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx. But since f is odd, ∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = ∫₀^infty f(-x) dx = ∫₀^infty -f(x) dx = -∫₀^infty f(x) dx. Therefore, ∫₀}^infty f(x) dx = -(-∫₀^infty f(x) dx) = ∫₀^infty f(x) dx. Which implies that ∫₀^infty f(x) dx = 0. But our direct calculation gives 1. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but when I computed the integral directly, I split it into two terms and got 1. But according to symmetry, it should be zero. So which one is correct? Let me check the integrals again. Let's compute ∫₀^infty x³ e^{-x²} dx. Let u = x², du = 2x dx. Then x³ dx = x² * x dx = u * (du/2x). Wait, but x = sqrt(u), so x³ dx = u * sqrt(u) * (du/(2 sqrt(u))) )? Wait, no. Let me re-express. If u = x², then x = sqrt(u), dx = du/(2 sqrt(u)). So x³ dx = (u^{3/2}) * (du/(2 sqrt(u))) ) = (u^{3/2} * u^{-1/2}) du/2 = u^{1} du/2. So ∫ x³ e^{-x²} dx = ∫ u e^{-u} (du/2) from 0 to ∞. Which is (1/2) Γ(2) = 1/2. So 4*(1/2) = 2. Then ∫ x e^{-x²} dx = 1/2, so -2*(1/2) = -1. Total 2-1 =1. But according to symmetry, the integral should be zero. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Hermite polynomial is H_2(1.0x), but in the integral, we have x^{2-1} e^{-1.0x²} Hmm, the original integral is ∫₀^infty x^{2-1} e^{-1.0x²} H_2(1.0x) dx. So x^{2-1} is x^1, so x. Then e^{-1.0x²} is e^{-x²}. H_2(1.0x) is H_2(x). So the integrand is x * H_2(x) * e^{-x²}. Which is (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²}. So the integrand is indeed odd. Therefore, the integral over the entire real line is zero, but the integral from 0 to ∞ is 1. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the symmetry argument or in the direct calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the symmetry argument. Let me think again. The integral from 0 to ∞ of an odd function is not necessarily zero. For example, ∫₀^infty x e^{-x²} dx is 1/2, which is non-zero, even though x e^{-x²} is an odd function. Wait, no. Wait, x e^{-x²} is an odd function. But ∫₀^infty x e^{-x²} dx = 1/2, and ∫_{-infty}^0 x e^{-x²} dx = -1/2. So the total integral over the real line is zero, but the integral from 0 to ∞ is 1/2. So in this case, the integral of an odd function from 0 to ∞ is not zero. Therefore, the symmetry argument only tells us that the integral over the entire real line is zero, but the integral from 0 to ∞ can be non-zero. Therefore, there is no contradiction. The previous calculation of 1 is correct. The symmetry argument just says that the integral from 0 to ∞ is equal to the negative of the integral from -infty to 0, but since the function is odd, the integral from -infty to 0 is the negative of the integral from 0 to ∞. Therefore, ∫₀^infty f(x) dx = -∫_{-infty}^0 f(x) dx = -(-∫₀^infty f(x) dx) = ∫₀^infty f(x) dx. Which implies that ∫₀^infty f(x) dx = ∫₀^infty f(x) dx, which is a tautology. Therefore, the symmetry argument doesn't force the integral to be zero. Therefore, the previous calculation of 1 is correct. Therefore, the answer is 1, and the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000.

But let me check with another approach. Let's use integration by parts. Let me consider the integral ∫ x H_2(x) e^{-x²} dx. H_2(x) = 4x² -2. So the integral is ∫ (4x³ -2x) e^{-x²} dx. Let's split into two integrals: 4∫x³ e^{-x²} dx -2∫x e^{-x²} dx. For the first integral, let me set u = x², dv = x e^{-x²} dx. Wait, but maybe another substitution. Alternatively, note that x³ e^{-x²} = x² * x e^{-x²}. Let me set u = x², dv = x e^{-x²} dx. Then du = 2x dx, and v = -1/(2) e^{-x²}. So integration by parts: uv|₀^infty - ∫ v du. So -1/2 x² e^{-x²} |₀^infty + ∫ (1/2) e^{-x²} * 2x dx. The boundary terms: at infinity, x² e^{-x²} tends to zero; at zero, it's zero. So the first term is zero. Then the integral becomes ∫ x e^{-x²} dx = 1/2. So the first integral is 4*(1/2) = 2. The second integral is -2*(1/2) = -1. So total 1. So this confirms the result again. Therefore, the integral is indeed 1. Therefore, the exact answer is 1, and the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000.
