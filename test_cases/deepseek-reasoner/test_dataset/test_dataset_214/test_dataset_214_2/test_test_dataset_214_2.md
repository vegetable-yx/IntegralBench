Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1/2) cos(1.0√(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's a substitution that can simplify it.

First, the integrand has x^(-1/2) and (2 - x)^(-1/2). That reminds me of the Beta function or maybe an integral that can be transformed using a trigonometric substitution. The Beta function is usually in the form ∫ t^(a-1)(1 - t)^(b-1) dt from 0 to 1, which relates to the Gamma function. But here, the limits are from 0 to 2, and there's a cosine term involved. The presence of the cosine complicates things, though.

Let me consider a substitution to make the expression under the square root simpler. The term inside the cosine is √(x(2 - x)). Let's set a substitution for the argument of the cosine. Let’s let u = √(x(2 - x)). But maybe a better substitution would be to use a trigonometric identity. Let me think. If I set x = 2 sin²θ, then 2 - x = 2 cos²θ. Let's try that substitution.

Let’s try x = 2 sin²θ. Then, dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's check the limits. When x = 0, sinθ = 0, so θ = 0. When x = 2, sinθ = 1, so θ = π/2. That seems manageable.

Now, substituting into the integrand:

x^(-1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(-1/2) = (2)^(-1/2) (sinθ)^(-1)

(2 - x)^(-1/2) = (2 cos²θ)^(-1/2) = (2)^(-1/2) (cosθ)^(-1)

So multiplying these together: (2)^(-1/2) * (2)^(-1/2) = 2^(-1) = 1/2, and (sinθ cosθ)^(-1) = 1/(sinθ cosθ)

The argument of the cosine becomes 1.0 * √(x(2 - x)) = √(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = √(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So cos(2 sinθ cosθ). Wait, 2 sinθ cosθ is sin(2θ), so the argument is sin(2θ). Therefore, the integrand's cosine term is cos(sin(2θ)).

Putting it all together, the integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to θ=π/2 of [1/(2 sinθ cosθ)] * cos(sin(2θ)) * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Wait, let's compute each part:

Original integrand: x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} cos(...) dx

After substitution:

x^{-1/2} = (2 sin²θ)^{-1/2} = 1/(√2 sinθ)

(2 - x)^{-1/2} = (2 cos²θ)^{-1/2} = 1/(√2 cosθ)

Multiply those: 1/(√2 sinθ) * 1/(√2 cosθ) = 1/(2 sinθ cosθ)

Then, dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

So the integrand becomes [1/(2 sinθ cosθ)] * cos(1.0 * 2 sinθ cosθ) * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify the terms:

The 1/(2 sinθ cosθ) multiplied by 4 sinθ cosθ gives 4/(2) = 2. So the integral simplifies to 2 * cos(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ from 0 to π/2.

But 2 sinθ cosθ is sin(2θ), so the integrand is 2 cos(sin(2θ)) dθ. Hmm, that's still not straightforward. Maybe another substitution here?

Let’s set t = 2θ. Then when θ=0, t=0; θ=π/2, t=π. dθ = dt/2. Then the integral becomes 2 * ∫ cos(sin t) * (dt/2) from t=0 to t=π. So that's ∫ cos(sin t) dt from 0 to π. Wait, but integrating cos(sin t) from 0 to π. Hmm, is there a known integral for that?

Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here. The integral of cos(sin t) from 0 to π. Let me recall that ∫₀^π cos(sin t) dt is a known integral. Wait, I think there's a standard integral involving Bessel functions. Let me recall that ∫₀^π cos(a sin t) dt = π J₀(a), where J₀ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. Is that correct?

Yes, I think that's a standard result. Let me check. The integral representation of the Bessel function J₀(z) is (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(z sin t) dt. So ∫₀^π cos(z sin t) dt = π J₀(z). So in our case, z = 1.0. Therefore, the integral becomes π J₀(1).

Therefore, going back through the substitutions:

Our integral after substitution was ∫₀^π cos(sin t) dt = π J₀(1). Therefore, the original integral is equal to π J₀(1). Wait, let me retrace:

Original integral after substitution became 2 * ∫₀^{π/2} cos(sin(2θ)) dθ. Then we set t = 2θ, so θ from 0 to π/2 becomes t from 0 to π, and dθ = dt/2. Then the integral becomes 2 * ∫₀^π cos(sin t) * (dt/2) = ∫₀^π cos(sin t) dt = π J₀(1). So the original integral is π J₀(1).

Therefore, the exact answer is π times the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero evaluated at 1. So the analytical solution is π J₀(1).

Now, the problem says to compute the integral analytically. So the exact answer is π J₀(1). Then, the numerical approximation would be π multiplied by the numerical value of J₀(1).

I need to compute J₀(1). The Bessel function J₀(1) is a known value. Let me recall that J₀(1) ≈ 0.7651976866. Let me verify that. Yes, J₀(1) is approximately 0.76519768655796655145... So multiplying by π gives π * 0.76519768655796655145 ≈ 2.4039394305.

So the numerical value is approximately 2.4039394305, which to 10 decimal places is 2.4039394305. Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, use a more precise value.

Alternatively, use the known value of J₀(1) = sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k!)^2 (1/2)^{2k} }.

But perhaps using a calculator or known tables. For example, J₀(1) ≈ 0.76519768655796655145. Then π times that is approximately 3.141592653589793 * 0.76519768655796655145 ≈ 2.403939430634413. So rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 2.4039394306. Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute J₀(1) first. From tables or using a calculator:

J_0(1) ≈ 0.765197686557966551449717526...

Multiply by π:

0.765197686557966551449717526 * π ≈

0.765197686557966551449717526 * 3.141592653589793 ≈

Let me compute this step by step:

0.76519768655796655 * 3.141592653589793

First, 0.7 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 2.199114857512855

0.06 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 0.1884955592153876

0.00519768655796655 * 3.141592653589793 ≈

0.005 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 0.015707963267948965

0.00019768655796655 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ approx 0.000621118

Adding up:

2.199114857512855 + 0.1884955592153876 ≈ 2.3876104167282426

0.015707963267948965 + 0.000621118 ≈ 0.016329081267948965

Total ≈ 2.3876104167282426 + 0.016329081267948965 ≈ 2.4039394979961916

So approximately 2.4039394980, which to 10 decimal places is 2.4039394980. Wait, but depending on the exact value of J₀(1), maybe the 10th decimal place is different. Let me check a more precise value.

Alternatively, use a calculator. For example, using Wolfram Alpha, the integral ∫₀² x^{-1/2} (2 - x)^{-1/2} cos(√(x(2 - x))) dx is equal to π J₀(1). And the numerical value of π BesselJ[0,1] ≈ 2.4039394306344133. So rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 2.4039394306.

Therefore, the exact answer is π J_0(1), and the numerical approximation is approximately 2.4039394306.

So the steps are:

1. Use substitution x = 2 sin²θ, which transforms the integral into a form involving cos(sin(2θ)) and simplifies the integrand.

2. Recognize the resulting integral as a standard form related to the Bessel function J₀(1).

3. Express the exact answer in terms of π and J₀(1).

4. Compute the numerical value using known values of π and J₀(1).

Therefore, the final answer is π J₀(1), and the numerical value is approximately 2.4039394306.
