Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from π/6 to π/3 of (sin x + cos x) divided by the square root of sin(2x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but maybe I can simplify the integrand first.

First, I remember that sin(2x) is 2 sin x cos x. So the denominator becomes sqrt(2 sin x cos x). Let me write that down: sqrt(2 sin x cos x) is the same as sqrt(2) times sqrt(sin x cos x). So the integrand is (sin x + cos x) divided by sqrt(2) times sqrt(sin x cos x). Maybe I can split the numerator?

Let me separate the terms in the numerator. So (sin x)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(sin x cos x)) + (cos x)/(sqrt(2) sqrt(sin x cos x)). Simplifying each term, for the first term: sin x divided by sqrt(sin x cos x) is sqrt(sin x / cos x), right? Because sqrt(sin x cos x) is sqrt(sin x) * sqrt(cos x), so sin x over that would be sqrt(sin x)/sqrt(cos x) which is sqrt(tan x). Similarly, the second term: cos x over sqrt(sin x cos x) would be sqrt(cos x / sin x) which is sqrt(cot x). So the integrand becomes [sqrt(tan x) + sqrt(cot x)] / sqrt(2).

Wait, but sqrt(tan x) is (sin x / cos x)^(1/2) and sqrt(cot x) is (cos x / sin x)^(1/2). Let me check that again. If I have sin x divided by sqrt(sin x cos x), that's sin x / (sqrt(sin x) sqrt(cos x)) = sqrt(sin x)/sqrt(cos x) = sqrt(tan x). Similarly for the other term. So yes, the integrand simplifies to (sqrt(tan x) + sqrt(cot x)) / sqrt(2). Hmm, maybe there's a way to make this easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let's think. Let me consider substitution for the denominator. Let u = sin x - cos x or something? Wait, or maybe u = sin x + cos x. Let me see. Alternatively, since the denominator is sqrt(sin 2x), which is sqrt(2 sin x cos x), perhaps a substitution involving sin x cos x.

Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of tan x. Let me try that. Let t = tan x. Then, dt/dx = sec²x = 1 + tan²x. So dx = dt / (1 + t²). Let's see. Then sin x = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cos x = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²). So sin x + cos x = (t + 1)/sqrt(1 + t²). The denominator sqrt(sin 2x) is sqrt(2 sin x cos x) = sqrt(2 * (t / sqrt(1 + t²)) * (1 / sqrt(1 + t²))) = sqrt(2 t) / (1 + t²)^(1/2). So the integrand becomes [ (t + 1)/sqrt(1 + t²) ] / [ sqrt(2 t) / (1 + t²)^(1/2) ) ] * dx. Wait, simplifying that: numerator is (t + 1)/sqrt(1 + t²), denominator is sqrt(2 t)/(1 + t²)^(1/2). So when we divide, the (1 + t²)^(1/2) cancels out. So we get (t + 1) / sqrt(2 t) * dx. But dx is dt / (1 + t²). So the integral becomes ∫ (t + 1)/(sqrt(2 t) (1 + t²)) dt. Hmm, not sure if that's better. Let's see. Let me check the limits. When x = π/6, tan x = 1/√3, so t = 1/√3. When x = π/3, tan x = √3. So the integral becomes from t = 1/√3 to t = √3 of (t + 1)/(sqrt(2 t)(1 + t²)) dt. Maybe this is manageable. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps split the numerator (t + 1) into t and 1. So split the integral into two parts: ∫ t/(sqrt(2 t)(1 + t²)) dt + ∫ 1/(sqrt(2 t)(1 + t²)) dt. Simplify each term. The first term: t / sqrt(2 t) is sqrt(t)/sqrt(2). So first integral becomes sqrt(t)/(sqrt(2)(1 + t²)) dt. The second term is 1/(sqrt(2 t)(1 + t²)) dt, which is 1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(t) (1 + t²)) dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe substitution for each integral. Let me consider the first integral: sqrt(t)/(1 + t²) dt. Let u = t², then du = 2t dt. Wait, but we have sqrt(t) dt. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe substitution u = sqrt(t). Let u = t^(1/2), so t = u², dt = 2u du. Then the first integral becomes u / (1 + u^4) * 2u du = 2u² / (1 + u^4) du. Not sure. The second integral: 1/(sqrt(t)(1 + t²)) dt. Let u = sqrt(t), same substitution. Then t = u², dt = 2u du. So integral becomes 1/(u (1 + u^4)) * 2u du = 2/(1 + u^4) du. Hmm, so combining both integrals, the first becomes 2u²/(1 + u^4) du and the second becomes 2/(1 + u^4) du. So total integral (after substitution) is [2u² + 2]/(1 + u^4) du. Factor out 2: 2(u² + 1)/(u^4 + 1) du. Hmm, maybe this is a standard integral. Let me see. The denominator u^4 + 1 can be factored as (u² + sqrt(2)u + 1)(u² - sqrt(2)u + 1). But integrating (u² + 1)/(u^4 + 1) might be possible. Let me check. Let's write u^4 + 1 = (u²)^2 + 1. Hmm, but integrating (u² + 1)/(u^4 + 1) du. Let me split the numerator: (u² + 1) = (u^4 + 1) - u^4 + u². Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by u²: (1 + 1/u²)/(u² + 1/u²). Let me set v = u - 1/u. Then dv = (1 + 1/u²) du. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, note that u^4 + 1 = (u^2 + 1)^2 - 2u^2. So (u^2 + 1)/(u^4 + 1) = (u^2 + 1)/[(u^2 + 1)^2 - 2u^2] = (u^2 + 1)/(u^4 + 2u^2 + 1 - 2u^2) = (u^2 + 1)/(u^4 + 1). Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that the integral after substitution is 2*(u² + 1)/(u^4 + 1) du. Let me split the fraction: (u² + 1)/(u^4 + 1) = [1 + u²]/[u^4 + 1]. Maybe split into two terms: 1/(u^4 + 1) + u²/(u^4 + 1). Then integrate each term. The integral of 1/(u^4 + 1) du is known, and the integral of u²/(u^4 + 1) du is also known. Let me recall that ∫1/(u^4 + 1) du can be done by partial fractions, but it's a bit involved. Similarly for ∫u²/(u^4 + 1) du. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can help here. Let me think. For ∫1/(u^4 + 1) du, we can write u^4 + 1 = (u^2 + sqrt(2)u + 1)(u^2 - sqrt(2)u + 1). Then use partial fractions. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe use substitution v = u - 1/u. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, note that u^4 + 1 = (u^2)^2 + 1, so maybe substitution v = u^2. Then dv = 2u du, but not sure. Hmm, this seems getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better substitution earlier on.

Wait, maybe going back to the original integral. Let me try a different approach. The integrand is (sin x + cos x)/sqrt(sin 2x). Let me consider substituting t = sin x - cos x. Then dt/dx = cos x + sin x. Wait, that's exactly the numerator! Because dt/dx = cos x + sin x. So if I let t = sin x - cos x, then dt = (cos x + sin x) dx. So the integral becomes ∫ dt / sqrt(sin 2x). But sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x. Let me express sin 2x in terms of t. Since t = sin x - cos x, then t² = sin²x - 2 sin x cos x + cos²x = 1 - sin 2x. Therefore, sin 2x = 1 - t². So sqrt(sin 2x) = sqrt(1 - t²). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ dt / sqrt(1 - t²). That's much simpler! So the integral is ∫ dt / sqrt(1 - t²) = arcsin(t) + C. Therefore, the integral from x = π/6 to x = π/3 is arcsin(t) evaluated from t = sin(π/6) - cos(π/6) to t = sin(π/3) - cos(π/3).

Let me compute those limits. First, at x = π/6: sin(π/6) = 1/2, cos(π/6) = sqrt(3)/2. So t = 1/2 - sqrt(3)/2. At x = π/3: sin(π/3) = sqrt(3)/2, cos(π/3) = 1/2. So t = sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2. Therefore, the integral is arcsin(sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2) - arcsin(1/2 - sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute these values.

First, let's compute t1 = sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2 ≈ 0.8660/2 - 0.5 ≈ 0.4330 - 0.5 = -0.06699... Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.8660, so sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2 is approximately 0.8660 - 0.5 = 0.3660. Similarly, 1/2 - sqrt(3)/2 is approximately -0.3660. So the integral becomes arcsin(0.3660) - arcsin(-0.3660). Since arcsin is an odd function, arcsin(-y) = -arcsin(y). So this becomes arcsin(0.3660) - (-arcsin(0.3660)) = 2 arcsin(0.3660). But 0.3660 is approximately sin(π/6) = 0.5, but 0.3660 is less than that. Wait, let's compute the value exactly. Let me compute t = sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2. Let's rationalize this. sqrt(3)/2 - 1/2 = (sqrt(3) - 1)/2. Similarly, the other limit is (1 - sqrt(3))/2. So the integral is arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) - arcsin((1 - sqrt(3))/2). But since arcsin(-x) = -arcsin(x), this becomes arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) + arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) = 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). So the exact answer is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Hmm, but can we simplify this further?

Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can express this in terms of known angles. Let me compute (sqrt(3)-1)/2. Let's compute its numerical value: sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so sqrt(3)-1 ≈ 0.732, divided by 2 is approximately 0.366. So arcsin(0.366) is approximately 0.374 radians, which is about 21.5 degrees. But I need an exact expression. Alternatively, maybe (sqrt(3)-1)/2 is sin(π/12) or something. Let's check. sin(15 degrees) is sin(π/12) = (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.2588. Hmm, that's smaller. sin(30 degrees) is 0.5. So 0.366 is between 0.2588 and 0.5. Maybe sin(22.5 degrees) is sin(π/8) = sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.3827, which is close to 0.366. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific angle. Let me compute sin(π/12) = sin(15°), which is (sqrt(6)-sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.2588. sin(π/6) = 0.5. So maybe (sqrt(3)-1)/2 is sin(π/12 + something). Alternatively, perhaps use a trigonometric identity. Let me set θ = arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Then sin θ = (sqrt(3)-1)/2. Let's square both sides: sin²θ = ( (sqrt(3)-1)^2 ) / 4 = (3 - 2 sqrt(3) + 1)/4 = (4 - 2 sqrt(3))/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/2. So sin²θ = (2 - sqrt(3))/2. But I know that sin²(π/12) = sin²(15°) = (1 - cos(30°))/2 = (1 - sqrt(3)/2)/2 = (2 - sqrt(3))/4. Wait, but here we have (2 - sqrt(3))/2, which is double that. So sin²θ = 2*(2 - sqrt(3))/4 = 2*sin²(π/12). Hmm, so sin²θ = 2 sin²(π/12). Therefore, sinθ = sqrt(2) sin(π/12). But that might not help. Alternatively, maybe θ = π/6 - π/12 = π/12. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for sin(a - b). Let me think. Let me compute sin(π/3 - π/4) = sin(π/12). Wait, π/3 - π/4 = π/12. So sin(π/12) = sin(π/3 - π/4) = sin π/3 cos π/4 - cos π/3 sin π/4 = (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(2)/2) - (1/2)(sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(6)/4 - sqrt(2)/4 = (sqrt(6) - sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.2588. Not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe θ is π/6. Wait, sin(π/6) = 0.5, which is larger. So perhaps there's no standard angle here. Therefore, the exact answer is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Alternatively, maybe we can express this in terms of inverse trigonometric functions with known angles. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can lead to a simpler expression. Let me think again.

Wait, going back to the substitution t = sin x - cos x. Then the integral becomes arcsin(t) evaluated from t = (1 - sqrt(3))/2 to t = (sqrt(3) - 1)/2. So the integral is arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) - arcsin((1 - sqrt(3))/2). But since arcsin is odd, arcsin(-y) = -arcsin(y), so this becomes arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) - (-arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2)) = 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). So the exact answer is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Alternatively, maybe we can be expressed in terms of π. Let me check if (sqrt(3)-1)/2 is equal to sin(π/12). Wait, sin(π/12) is (sqrt(6)-sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.2588, which is less than (sqrt(3)-1)/2 ≈ 0.366. So no. Alternatively, maybe it's sin(π/6 - π/12) = sin(π/12), which we already saw. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps use a trigonometric identity for arcsin. Let me recall that arcsin(a) + arcsin(b) = something, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe use the identity for arcsin(a) - arcsin(b). Wait, but here we have two terms. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that 2 arcsin(a) can be expressed as another inverse trigonometric function. For example, if we set 2 arcsin(a) = arccos(1 - 2a²). Let me check. Let θ = arcsin(a), then sinθ = a, and cosθ = sqrt(1 - a²). Then, cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ = 1 - 2a². So 2θ = arccos(1 - 2a²). Therefore, 2 arcsin(a) = arccos(1 - 2a²). So applying this to our case, where a = (sqrt(3)-1)/2. Then 1 - 2a² = 1 - 2*((sqrt(3)-1)/2)^2. Let's compute that. First, compute a: a = (sqrt(3) - 1)/2. Then a² = ( (sqrt(3) - 1)^2 ) / 4 = (3 - 2 sqrt(3) + 1)/4 = (4 - 2 sqrt(3))/4 = (2 - sqrt(3))/2. Therefore, 1 - 2a² = 1 - 2*(2 - sqrt(3))/2 = 1 - (2 - sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3) - 1. Therefore, 2 arcsin(a) = arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). But sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 0.732, which is greater than 1, but arccos is only for arguments between -1 and 1. Wait, that can't be. So this suggests an error in the previous step. Wait, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 0.732, which is less than 1. So arccos(0.732) is valid. So 2 arcsin(a) = arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). Therefore, the exact answer can be written as arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). Alternatively, since arccos(sqrt(3) - 1) is the same as 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). But is sqrt(3) - 1 equal to cos(2θ)? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps this is a known angle. Let me compute arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). Let's compute sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 0.732. So arccos(0.732) ≈ 43 degrees (since cos(45°) ≈ 0.707, cos(30°) ≈ 0.866). So 0.732 is between 0.707 and 0.866, so the arccos would be between 30° and 45°, say around 43 degrees. But I don't think this corresponds to a standard angle. Therefore, the exact answer is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2) or arccos(sqrt(3)-1). Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first one is more straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe there's another substitution that can lead to a simpler expression. Let me think. Going back to the original integral: ∫ (sin x + cos x)/sqrt(sin 2x) dx from π/6 to π/3. Let me try another substitution. Let u = sin x + cos x. Then du/dx = cos x - sin x. Not sure. Alternatively, let me consider that the integrand can be written as (sin x + cos x)/sqrt(2 sin x cos x). Let me factor out sqrt(2) from the denominator: 1/sqrt(2) * (sin x + cos x)/sqrt(sin x cos x). Let me write this as 1/sqrt(2) [ sqrt(sin x) / sqrt(cos x) + sqrt(cos x)/sqrt(sin x) ] = 1/sqrt(2) [ sqrt(tan x) + sqrt(cot x) ]. Let me combine these terms: sqrt(tan x) + sqrt(cot x) = sqrt(tan x) + 1/sqrt(tan x) = (tan x + 1)/sqrt(tan x). So the integrand becomes 1/sqrt(2) * (tan x + 1)/sqrt(tan x). Let me set t = sqrt(tan x). Then tan x = t², so x = arctan(t²). Then dx = (2t)/(1 + t^4) dt. Wait, no. Wait, if t = sqrt(tan x), then tan x = t², so dx = dt / ( derivative of arctan(t²) ). Wait, derivative of arctan(t²) with respect to t is (2t)/(1 + t^4). Therefore, dx = (1 + t^4)/(2t) dt. Wait, no. Let me compute dx in terms of dt. If t = sqrt(tan x), then tan x = t². Differentiating both sides: sec²x dx = 2t dt. So dx = 2t dt / sec²x. But sec²x = 1 + tan²x = 1 + t^4. Therefore, dx = 2t dt / (1 + t^4). So substituting into the integral: integrand is 1/sqrt(2) * (t² + 1)/t. So the integral becomes 1/sqrt(2) * (t² + 1)/t * 2t/(1 + t^4) dt. Simplify: 1/sqrt(2) * (t² + 1) * 2/(1 + t^4) dt. The t in the denominator cancels with the t in the numerator. So we have 2/sqrt(2) * (t² + 1)/(t^4 + 1) dt. 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So integral becomes sqrt(2) * ∫ (t² + 1)/(t^4 + 1) dt. Hmm, this seems similar to what I had before. Let me see. The integral of (t² + 1)/(t^4 + 1) dt. Let me split it into two integrals: ∫ t²/(t^4 + 1) dt + ∫ 1/(t^4 + 1) dt. But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, note that t^4 + 1 = (t² + sqrt(2)t + 1)(t² - sqrt(2)t + 1). But integrating this would require partial fractions, which might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me try substituting u = t - 1/t. Then du = (1 + 1/t²) dt. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, note that (t² + 1)/(t^4 + 1) = (t² + 1)/(t^4 + 1) = [1 + 1/t²]/(t² + 1/t²). Let me set u = t - 1/t. Then u² = t² - 2 + 1/t². So t² + 1/t² = u² + 2. Then the integrand becomes [1 + 1/t²]/(u² + 2) = (u² + 2 - 2 + 1 + 1/t²)/ (u² + 2). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the numerator is 1 + 1/t² = (t² + 1)/t². So the integrand becomes (t² + 1)/t² divided by (t^4 + 1) = (t² + 1)/(t^2(t^4 + 1)) = (t² + 1)/(t^6 + t²). Hmm, not helpful. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, let's go back to the substitution t = sin x - cos x, which gave us the integral as 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Let me compute this numerically to check. Let's compute (sqrt(3)-1)/2 ≈ (1.732 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.732/2 ≈ 0.366. Then arcsin(0.366) ≈ 0.374 radians. Multiply by 2: ≈ 0.748 radians. Let me check with numerical integration. The original integral from π/6 to π/3 of (sin x + cos x)/sqrt(sin 2x) dx. Let me approximate this numerically. Let's take x = π/6: sin(π/6) = 0.5, cos(π/6) ≈ 0.8660, sin(2x) = sin(π/3) ≈ 0.8660. So the integrand at π/6 is (0.5 + 0.8660)/sqrt(0.8660) ≈ 1.3660 / 0.9306 ≈ 1.468. At x = π/3: sin(π/3) ≈ 0.8660, cos(π/3) = 0.5, sin(2x) = sin(2π/3) ≈ 0.8660. So integrand is (0.8660 + 0.5)/sqrt(0.8660) ≈ 1.3660 / 0.9306 ≈ 1.468. The function seems symmetric. Let me compute the integral numerically using midpoint between π/6 and π/3. The interval is π/4. Let me check the integrand at π/4: sin(π/4) + cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142. sin(2x) = sin(π/2) = 1. So integrand is sqrt(2)/1 = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142. So the function is around 1.4142 to 1.468. The interval is π/3 - π/6 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236 radians. So approximate integral is average value * interval. Average value between 1.4142 and 1.468 is roughly 1.44. So 1.44 * 0.5236 ≈ 0.754, which is close to the previous estimate of 0.748. So the exact answer is approximately 0.748 radians. But I need to compute this more accurately. Let me compute 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2). Let's compute (sqrt(3)-1)/2 ≈ (1.7320508075688772 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.7320508075688772 / 2 ≈ 0.3660254037844386. Then arcsin(0.3660254037844386) ≈ 0.3746065934 radians. Multiply by 2: ≈ 0.7492131868. So the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7492131868. Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, use a more precise method. Let me compute the integral numerically using substitution.

Alternatively, since the integral is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2), and we can compute this value numerically. Let me compute (sqrt(3)-1)/2:

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772935

sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 0.7320508075688772935

divided by 2: ≈ 0.36602540378443864675

Now, compute arcsin(0.36602540378443864675). Let's use a calculator. The arcsin of 0.3660254037844386 is approximately 0.374606593415912 radians. Multiply by 2: 0.749213186831824 radians. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 0.7492131868. So the numerical answer is approximately 0.7492131868.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2), which can be written in LaTeX as 2 \arcsin\left( \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \right). Alternatively, since we showed that 2 arcsin(a) = arccos(1 - 2a²), and 1 - 2a² = sqrt(3) - 1, but that led to arccos(sqrt(3) - 1), but sqrt(3) - 1 is approximately 0.732, which is valid. So another form is arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). Let me check if that's correct. Let's compute arccos(sqrt(3) - 1). sqrt(3) - 1 ≈ 0.732. arccos(0.732) ≈ 43 degrees, which is approximately 0.749 radians, which matches the previous result. So both forms are correct. However, the problem asks for the exact answer. Either form is acceptable, but perhaps the first form with arcsin is more straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler expression. Let me think. Let me recall that (sqrt(3)-1)/2 is equal to sin(15° + 30°)/something. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for arcsin. Let me consider that 2 arcsin(a) can be expressed as another inverse trigonometric function. But unless there's a standard angle, which there doesn't seem to be, the answer remains as 2 arcsin((sqrt(3)-1)/2).

Therefore, the exact answer is 2 \arcsin\left( \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \right), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7492131868.
