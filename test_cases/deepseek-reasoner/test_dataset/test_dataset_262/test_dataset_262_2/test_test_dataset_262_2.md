Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times arccos(x) times the Bessel function J0(2x) dx. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

I remember that integrating products of functions often involves integration by parts. The presence of arccos(x) and a Bessel function complicates things, though. Let me recall some properties of these functions. The Bessel function J0(2x) is a solution to Bessel's differential equation, and arccos(x) has a derivative that's -1/sqrt(1 - x²). Maybe integration by parts is the way to go here. Let's set u = arccos(x) and dv = x J0(2x) dx. Then du would be -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v would be the integral of x J0(2x) dx. Wait, but integrating x J0(2x) might not be straightforward. Let me check if there's a standard integral for that.

I recall that the integral of x^n J_{n-1}(ax) dx is (x^n / a) J_n(ax) + C. But here, we have J0(2x) multiplied by x. Let me adjust the formula. If n=1, then the integral of x J0(ax) dx would be (x/a) J1(ax) + C. Let me verify that. Differentiating (x/a) J1(ax), using the product rule: derivative of x/a is 1/a, times J1(ax), plus x/a times derivative of J1(ax). The derivative of J1(ax) with respect to x is a J0(ax) - J1(ax)/(ax) [Wait, actually, the derivative of J_n(z) with respect to z is (J_{n-1}(z) - J_{n+1}(z))/2, but maybe I need to check more carefully.]

Alternatively, the standard integral formula: ∫x J0(ax) dx = (x/a) J1(ax) + C. Let me confirm this. Let’s differentiate (x/a) J1(ax). The derivative is (1/a) J1(ax) + (x/a) * d/dx J1(ax). The derivative of J1(ax) with respect to x is a J0(ax) - (J1(ax)/x) [Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the recurrence relations for Bessel functions. The derivative of J_n(z) is (J_{n-1}(z) - J_{n+1}(z))/2. For n=1, d/dz J1(z) = (J0(z) - J2(z))/2. But when differentiating J1(ax) with respect to x, it's a * d/dz J1(z) evaluated at z=ax. So d/dx J1(ax) = a * (J0(ax) - J2(ax))/2. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler expression. Wait, another recurrence relation: d/dz [z^n J_n(z)] = z^n J_{n-1}(z). Let me check for n=1: d/dz [z J1(z)] = z J0(z). So integrating z J0(z) dz = z J1(z) + C. Therefore, if we have ∫x J0(ax) dx, let me make substitution t = ax, so x = t/a, dx = dt/a. Then the integral becomes ∫(t/a) J0(t) (dt/a) = 1/a² ∫t J0(t) dt = 1/a² [t J1(t)] + C = (1/a²)(ax) J1(ax) + C = (x/a) J1(ax) + C. Yes! So that formula is correct. Therefore, the integral of x J0(ax) dx is (x/a) J1(ax) + C. So in our case, a=2, so ∫x J0(2x) dx = (x/2) J1(2x) + C.

Okay, so going back to integration by parts. Let me set u = arccos(x), dv = x J0(2x) dx. Then du = -1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, and v = (x/2) J1(2x). Therefore, integration by parts gives uv evaluated from 0 to 1 minus integral of v du. So:

∫0^1 x arccos(x) J0(2x) dx = [arccos(x) * (x/2) J1(2x)] from 0 to 1 - ∫0^1 (x/2) J1(2x) * (-1/sqrt(1 - x²)) dx

Simplify the boundary terms first. At x=1, arccos(1) is 0, so that term is 0. At x=0, arccos(0) is π/2, and x/2 is 0, so the term is 0. Therefore, the boundary terms are zero. So the integral simplifies to:

∫0^1 (x/2) J1(2x) * (1/sqrt(1 - x²)) dx

So now, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫0^1 [x / sqrt(1 - x²)] J1(2x) dx. Hmm, this seems more complicated. Now, how to handle this integral? Let me think. Maybe another substitution? Let me consider substitution t = sqrt(1 - x²), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express J1(2x) in terms of an integral or a series expansion. Alternatively, maybe use orthogonality or integral representations of Bessel functions.

Alternatively, perhaps expand J1(2x) as a power series and integrate term by term. Let me recall the series expansion for J_n(z). The Bessel function J_n(z) has the series expansion:

J_n(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! Γ(k + n + 1)) ] (z/2)^{2k + n}

So for J1(2x), that would be:

J1(2x) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! Γ(k + 2)) ] (2x/2)^{2k + 1} = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)!) ] x^{2k + 1}

Because Γ(k + 2) = (k + 1)!.

So substituting this into the integral:

(1/2) ∫0^1 [x / sqrt(1 - x²)] Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)!) ] x^{2k + 1} dx

= (1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)!) ] ∫0^1 x^{2k + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx

So the integral becomes a sum over k of coefficients times ∫0^1 x^{2k + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let me compute that integral. Let me make substitution x = sinθ, so that sqrt(1 - x²) = cosθ, dx = cosθ dθ. Then when x=0, θ=0; x=1, θ=π/2. The integral becomes:

∫0^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k + 2} / cosθ * cosθ dθ = ∫0^{π/2} (sinθ)^{2k + 2} dθ

Which is a standard Beta function integral. The integral of sin^{m}θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((m + 1)/2) / Γ((m + 2)/2). For m = 2k + 2, which is even, so m = 2(k + 1). The integral is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((2k + 3)/2) / Γ((2k + 4)/2) ). Alternatively, using the formula:

∫0^{π/2} sin^{n}θ dθ = (π/2) * ( (n-1)!! / n!! ) if n is even, and 1 if n is odd. Wait, but here n = 2k + 2, which is even. So for n even, the integral is (π/2) * ( (n-1)!! / n!! ). Let me check for n=2m. Then ∫0^{π/2} sin^{2m}θ dθ = (π/2) ( (2m -1)!! ) / (2m)!! )

So here, n = 2k + 2, so m = k + 1. Therefore, the integral is (π/2) * ( (2(k + 1) - 1)!! ) / (2(k + 1))!! ) = (π/2) * ( (2k + 1)!! ) / (2k + 2)!! )

But 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1), so (2k + 2)!! = 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! )

Similarly, (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...3*1. Alternatively, (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Wait, let me recall that (2k)!! = 2^k k! and (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! )

Therefore, (2k + 1)!! / (2k + 2)!! = [ (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! ) ] / [ 2^{k + 1} (k + 1)! ) ] = (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) )

Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 x^{2k + 2} / sqrt(1 - x²) dx = (π/2) * (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) )

So substituting back into the sum:

(1/2) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * (π/2) * (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) )

Simplify this expression:

= (π/4) Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1)! ] / [ k!^2 (k + 1)!^2 2^{2k + 1} ) ]

Wait, let's see:

The denominator in the sum term is k! (k + 1)! and then multiplied by 2^{2k + 1} and k! (k + 1)! from the Beta function part. Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Original coefficient in the sum: [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ]

Multiply by the integral result: (π/2) * (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) )

So combining these:

[ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * [ (π/2) (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ]

= (π/2) * (-1)^k (2k + 1)! / [ (k! (k + 1)! )^2 2^{2k + 1} ) ]

Then multiply by the 1/2 from outside:

Total coefficient: (π/4) * (-1)^k (2k + 1)! / [ (k! (k + 1)! )^2 2^{2k + 2} ) ] ?

Wait, no. Let me re-express step by step:

The entire expression is:

(1/2) * [ Σ term ] = (1/2) * [ Σ [ (-1)^k / (k! (k + 1)! ) ] * (π/2) * (2k + 1)! / (2^{2k + 1} k! (k + 1)! ) ) ]

So that's (1/2) * (π/2) * Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1)! / (k! (k + 1)! )^2 2^{2k + 1} ) ]

= (π/4) Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1)! / (k!^2 (k + 1)!^2 2^{2k + 1} ) ) ]

Hmm, this seems quite complicated. Let me see if this can be simplified. Let's write (2k + 1)! as (2k + 1)(2k)! So:

(2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! 

And 2^{2k + 1} = 2 * 4^k

So substituting:

= (π/4) Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1)(2k)! / (k!^2 (k + 1)!^2 2 * 4^k ) ) ]

= (π/8) Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1)(2k)! / (k!^2 (k + 1)!^2 4^k ) ) ]

But (2k)! / (k!^2) is the central binomial coefficient, which is (2k choose k) = (2k)! / (k!^2). So:

= (π/8) Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)!^2 4^k ) ) ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, note that (k + 1)! = (k + 1) k!, so (k + 1)!^2 = (k + 1)^2 (k!)^2. Therefore:

= (π/8) Σ [ (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k)! / ( (k + 1)^2 (k! )^4 4^k ) ) ]

This seems messy. Maybe there's a generating function or a hypergeometric function representation here. Let me think. The presence of (-1)^k, (2k + 1), and the factorials suggests that this series might be expressible in terms of hypergeometric functions. Let me recall that hypergeometric functions are represented as Σ [ (a)_k (b)_k / (c)_k k! ] z^k. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the sum in terms of a hypergeometric function. Let me see. Let's write the term as:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k)! / ( (k! )^2 (k + 1)!^2 4^k )

Let me express (2k)! / (k!^2) = (2k choose k). So:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)!^2 4^k )

But (k + 1)!^2 = (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2, so:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 4^k )

Alternatively, (2k choose k) = (2k)! / (k! )^2, so substituting:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k)! / ( (k! )^2 (k + 1)!^2 4^k )

But I'm not sure. Let me try to manipulate the term:

Let me write (2k + 1) as (k + 1 + k). Not sure. Alternatively, note that (2k + 1) = (k + 1) + k. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps express the term in terms of (k + 1) in the denominator. Let's see:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 4^k )

But (2k choose k) = (2k)! / (k! )^2, so:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k)! / ( (k! )^2 (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 4^k )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, (k + 1)! = (k + 1) k!, so (k + 1)!^2 = (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2. Therefore, Term_k is:

(-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 4^k )

But (2k choose k) is (2k)! / (k! )^2, so substituting:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k)! / ( (k! )^2 (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 4^k )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, (k + 1)!^2 is (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2, so the denominator is (k + 1)^2 (k! )^2 * 4^k. So Term_k is:

(-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k )

Because (2k choose k) is (2k)! / (k! )^2, so when we divide by (k! )^2 (k + 1)^2 4^k, it's (2k choose k) / (k! )^2 is (2k)! / (k! )^4, but no, that's not helpful. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps express the term in terms of (k + 1) in the numerator. Let's see:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k + 1) (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k )

Let me write (2k + 1) as 2(k + 1) - 1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, note that (2k + 1)/(k + 1)^2 = [2(k + 1) - 1]/(k + 1)^2 = 2/(k + 1) - 1/(k + 1)^2. Maybe split the term into two parts. Let's try:

Term_k = (-1)^k (2k choose k) / (k + 1)^2 4^k ) * (2(k + 1) - 1) / (k + 1)^2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, (2k + 1) = 2(k + 1) - 1. So:

Term_k = (-1)^k [2(k + 1) - 1] (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k )

= (-1)^k [2/(k + 1) - 1/(k + 1)^2 ] (2k choose k) / 4^k

So splitting into two sums:

= 2 Σ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1) 4^k ) ] - Σ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k ) ]

Hmm, maybe these sums can be related to known series. Let me recall generating functions for (2k choose k) / 4^k. The generating function Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). So if x = -1/4, then Σ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4*(-1/4)) = 1/sqrt(2). So that's 1/√2. But here, we have terms divided by (k + 1) and (k + 1)^2. 

Let me consider the first sum: Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1) 4^k ) ]

Let me shift the index. Let n = k + 1, so k = n - 1. Then the sum becomes Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{n - 1} (2(n - 1) choose n - 1) / (n 4^{n - 1} ) ]

= Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{n - 1} (2n - 2 choose n - 1) / (n 4^{n - 1} ) ]

= (-1)^{-1} Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n (2n - 2 choose n - 1) / (n 4^{n - 1} ) ]

= - Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n (2(n - 1) choose n - 1) / (n 4^{n - 1} ) ]

Let m = n - 1, so n = m + 1. Then:

= - Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^{m + 1} (2m choose m) / ( (m + 1) 4^{m} ) ]

= Σ_{m=0}^∞ [ (-1)^m (2m choose m) / ( (m + 1) 4^{m} ) ]

But this is similar to the original sum. Wait, but this seems like integrating the generating function. Let me recall that Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). So integrating both sides from 0 to t:

∫0^t Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) x^k dx = ∫0^t 1/sqrt(1 - 4x) dx

Left side: Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) ∫0^t x^k dx = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) t^{k + 1} / (k + 1)

Right side: (-1/2) sqrt(1 - 4x) evaluated from 0 to t = (-1/2)(sqrt(1 - 4t) - 1) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4t))/2

Therefore, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) t^{k + 1} / (k + 1) ) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4t))/2

Therefore, Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) t^{k} / (k + 1) ) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4t))/(2t)

So for t = -1/4, we have:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k / (k + 1) ) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(-1/4)))/(2*(-1/4)) = (1 - sqrt(1 + 1))/(-1/2) = (1 - sqrt(2))/(-1/2) = 2(sqrt(2) - 1)

Therefore, the first sum is 2(sqrt(2) - 1). But wait, our first sum after substitution was Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1) 4^k ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k / (k + 1) ) = 2(sqrt(2) - 1). So that's the first sum.

Now, the second sum is Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k ) ]

This seems more complicated. Let me denote S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k / (k + 1)^2 ]

To compute S, perhaps differentiate the previous generating function. Let me recall that we have:

Σ_{k=0}^∞ (2k choose k) t^k / (k + 1) ) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4t))/(2t)

Let me call this F(t). Then, integrating F(t) with respect to t might give us the sum involving 1/(k + 1)^2. Let's see:

Let’s compute ∫ F(t) dt. Then:

∫ F(t) dt = ∫ [ (1 - sqrt(1 - 4t)) / (2t) ] dt

Let me make substitution u = sqrt(1 - 4t). Then u^2 = 1 - 4t, so 2u du = -4 dt => dt = - (u/2) du. When t=0, u=1; t = something, but the integral is indefinite. Alternatively, perhaps integrate by parts. Let me try integrating F(t):

Let’s split into two terms:

(1(t) - F2(t)) / (2t), where F1(t) = 1, F2(t) = sqrt(1 - 4t)

But integrating this directly might be tricky. Alternatively, consider differentiating the previous result. Let me recall that S = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k / (k + 1)^2 ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ a_k, where a_k = [ (2k choose k) (-1/4)^k ] / (k + 1)^2

But note that 1/(k + 1)^2 = ∫0^1 x^k dx * ∫0^1 y^k dy. Wait, perhaps using integral representation. Alternatively, note that 1/(k + 1)^2 = ∫0^1 x^k ( -ln x ) dx. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, consider that Σ_{k=0}^∞ a_k x^k = ?

Alternatively, let me consider integrating F(t) from 0 to some upper limit. Let me denote G(t) = ∫0^t F(s) du = ∫0^t [ (1 - sqrt(1 - 4s))/(2s) ] ds

But this integral might be complicated. Let me try substitution. Let s = (1 - u^2)/4, so that sqrt(1 - 4s) = u. Then when s=0, u=1; when s=t, u=sqrt(1 - 4t). Then ds = (-2u)/4 du = (-u/2) du. Therefore:

G(t) = ∫_{u=1}^{u=sqrt(1 - 4t)} [ (1 - u)/ (2 * (1 - u^2)/4) ) ] * (-u/2) du

Simplify the integrand:

(1 - u) / (2 * (1 - u^2)/4 ) = (1 - u) * 4 / (2(1 - u^2)) ) = 2(1 - u) / ( (1 - u)(1 + u) ) ) = 2 / (1 + u)

So G(t) = ∫_{1}^{sqrt(1 - 4t)} [ 2 / (1 + u) ] * (-u/2) du

= ∫_{sqrt(1 - 4t)}^{1} [ 2 / (1 + u) ] * (u/2) du

= ∫_{sqrt(1 - 4t)}^{1} [ u / (1 + u) ] du

= ∫ [ (1 + u - 1) / (1 + u) ] du = ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + u) ] du

= [ u - ln(1 + u) ] evaluated from sqrt(1 - 4t) to 1

= [1 - ln(2) ] - [ sqrt(1 - 4t) - ln(1 + sqrt(1 - 4t)) ]

Therefore, G(t) = 1 - ln(2) - sqrt(1 - 4t) + ln(1 + sqrt(1 - 4t)) 

But G(t) is the integral of F(t) from 0 to t, which is also equal to Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) / (k + 1) ) ∫0^t s^k ds ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) / (k + 1) ) * t^{k + 1} / (k + 1) ) ] = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) t^{k + 1} / (k + 1)^2 ) ]

Therefore, Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (2k choose k) t^{k} / (k + 1)^2 ) ] = G(t)/t

So substituting t = -1/4, we get:

S = G(-1/4)/(-1/4) = [1 - ln(2) - sqrt(1 - 4*(-1/4)) + ln(1 + sqrt(1 - 4*(-1/4)))] / (-1/4)

First compute sqrt(1 - 4*(-1/4)) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2)

So:

G(-1/4) = 1 - ln(2) - sqrt(2) + ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Therefore, S = [1 - ln(2) - sqrt(2) + ln(1 + sqrt(2))] / (-1/4) = -4 [1 - ln(2) - sqrt(2) + ln(1 + sqrt(2))]

= -4 + 4 ln(2) + 4 sqrt(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Simplify this expression. Let's compute the terms:

First term: -4

Second term: +4 ln(2)

Third term: +4 sqrt(2)

Fourth term: -4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Combine the logarithmic terms:

4 ln(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2)) = 4 [ ln(2) - ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ] = 4 ln(2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) )

Note that 2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = (2)(1 - sqrt(2)) / [ (1 + sqrt(2))(1 - sqrt(2)) ] = (2 - 2 sqrt(2)) / (1 - 2) = (2 - 2 sqrt(2)) / (-1) = 2 sqrt(2) - 2

Wait, but that's negative. Alternatively, rationalize the denominator:

2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = 2(1 - sqrt(2)) / (1 - 2) = 2(1 - sqrt(2)) / (-1) = 2(sqrt(2) - 1)

But this gives 2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = sqrt(2) - 1. Let me verify:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) - 1:

2 (sqrt(2) - 1) / [ (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) ] = 2 (sqrt(2) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2 (sqrt(2) - 1)/1 = 2 sqrt(2) - 2. Wait, but that contradicts. Wait, let me compute (1 + sqrt(2))(sqrt(2) - 1) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) -1*1*sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)

= 2 - sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) + 1 = 3 - 2 sqrt(2). Hmm, so that approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, compute 2 / (1 + sqrt(2)):

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, so 1 + sqrt(2) ≈ 2.4142, so 2 / 2.4142 ≈ 0.8284. And sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142, which is different. So my previous step was incorrect. Let me correct:

Actually, 2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = 2(1 - sqrt(2)) / (1 - 2) = 2(1 - sqrt(2))/(-1) = 2(sqrt(2) - 1). So yes, 2 / (1 + sqrt(2)) = 2(sqrt(2) - 1). Therefore, ln(2 / (1 + sqrt(2))) = ln(2(sqrt(2) - 1)) = ln(2) + ln(sqrt(2) - 1). But I'm not sure if that helps. Anyway, let's keep it as ln(2) - ln(1 + sqrt(2)).

So S = -4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 4 [ ln(2) - ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ]

= -4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 4 ln(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Now, going back to the original expression for the integral:

The original integral after integration by parts is (π/8) [ 2 * first_sum - second_sum ]

Wait, no. Wait, earlier we had:

The integral became (π/8) [ 2 * first_sum - second_sum ]

Wait, no. Let me go back. Wait, after splitting the term into two sums:

Term_k = [2/(k + 1) - 1/(k + 1)^2 ] * something, so the integral expression became:

(π/8) [ 2 Σ ... - Σ ... ]

But actually, the original expression after substitution was:

(π/8) [ 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1) 4^k ) ] - Σ_{k=0}^∞ [ (-1)^k (2k choose k) / ( (k + 1)^2 4^k ) ] ]

Which is (π/8) [ 2 * first_sum - second_sum ]

We computed first_sum = 2(sqrt(2) - 1)

And second_sum = S = -4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 4 ln(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Therefore, substituting:

= (π/8) [ 2 * 2(sqrt(2) - 1) - ( -4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 4 ln(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

First term: 2 * 2(sqrt(2) - 1) = 4 sqrt(2) - 4

Second term: - [ -4 + 4 sqrt(2) + 4 ln(2) - 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ] = 4 - 4 sqrt(2) - 4 ln(2) + 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

So total:

(4 sqrt(2) - 4) + (4 - 4 sqrt(2) - 4 ln(2) + 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))) 

= 4 sqrt(2) - 4 + 4 - 4 sqrt(2) - 4 ln(2) + 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

The 4 sqrt(2) and -4 sqrt(2) cancel, -4 +4 cancels, leaving:

= -4 ln(2) + 4 ln(1 + sqrt(2))

Factor out 4:

= 4 [ ln(1 + sqrt(2)) - ln(2) ]

= 4 ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 )

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(π/8) * 4 [ ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 ) ] = (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 )

Simplify (1 + sqrt(2))/2. Note that (1 + sqrt(2))/2 is equal to (sqrt(2) + 1)/2, which is approximately 1.2071/2 ≈ 0.6035. Alternatively, we can rationalize or express it differently, but perhaps it's simplest to leave it as is.

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 )

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute (1 + sqrt(2))/2 first:

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356237

1 + sqrt(2) ≈ 2.41421356237

Divide by 2: ≈ 1.20710678118

Wait, no, (1 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ (1 + 1.41421356237)/2 ≈ 2.41421356237/2 ≈ 1.207106781185

Then ln(1.207106781185) ≈ using calculator:

ln(1.2071) ≈ 0.1882

But let's compute more accurately. Let's use a calculator:

ln(1.207106781185) ≈ 0.188226993976

Multiply by π/2:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

π/2 ≈ 1.5707963267948966

Multiply by 0.188226993976:

1.5707963267948966 * 0.188226993976 ≈ 

Let me compute this:

0.1 * 1.5707963267948966 = 0.15707963267948966

0.08 * 1.5707963267948966 = 0.12566370614359173

0.008226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 0.5707963267948966 * 0.008226993976 ≈ 0.5707963267948966 * 0.008 = 0.0045663706, and 0.5707963267948966 * 0.000226993976 ≈ 0.0001297

So total ≈ 0.0045663706 + 0.0001297 ≈ 0.004696

So total approximation:

0.15707963267948966 + 0.12566370614359173 = 0.2827433388230814 + 0.004696 ≈ 0.2874393388230814

But this is a rough estimate. Let me use a calculator for precise computation:

0.188226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 

0.188226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈

0.008226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 

First compute 0.008 * 1.5707963267948966 = 0.012566370614359173

0.000226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 0.00035677

So total for 0.008226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 0.012566370614359173 + 0.00035677 ≈ 0.01292314

Adding all parts: 0.15707963267948966 + 0.12566370614359173 = 0.2827433388230814 + 0.01292314 ≈ 0.2956664788230814

So approximately 0.2956664788. Let me check with a calculator:

Using exact computation:

0.188226993976 * 1.5707963267948966

= 0.188226993976 * 1.5707963267948966

≈ 0.188227 * 1.5707963 ≈ 

0.1 * 1.5707963 = 0.15707963

0.08 * 1.5707963 = 0.1256637

0.008227 * 1.5707963 ≈ 0.012923

Adding: 0.15707963 + 0.1256637 = 0.28274333 + 0.012923 ≈ 0.29566633

So approximately 0.2956663. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 0.2956663335. Let me verify using a calculator:

Compute ln((1 + sqrt(2))/2):

(1 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ (1 + 1.41421356237)/2 ≈ 2.41421356237/2 ≈ 1.207106781185

ln(1.207106781185) ≈ 0.188226993976

Multiply by π/2 ≈ 1.5707963267948966:

0.188226993976 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 0.29566633281

So approximately 0.2956663328, which rounds to 0.2956663328. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.2956663328 ≈ 0.2956663328. So the numerical approximation is approximately 0.2956663328.

Therefore, the exact answer is (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 ), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.2956663328.

Let me check if there's a simpler form for the exact answer. Note that (1 + sqrt(2))/2 can be written as cos(π/8), since cos(π/8) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.92388, which is not the same as (1 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 1.2071/2 ≈ 0.6035. Wait, no. Wait, (1 + sqrt(2))/2 is approximately 1.2071/2 ≈ 0.6035, which is not cos(π/8). Alternatively, perhaps sinh^{-1}(1)/something? Not sure. Alternatively, note that (1 + sqrt(2))/2 is equal to sqrt(2)/2 + 1/2, which is (sqrt(2) + 1)/2, but I don't think that simplifies further. So the exact answer is (π/2) ln( (1 + sqrt(2))/2 ), which is the simplest form.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact answer: \frac{\pi}{2} \ln\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

Numerical approximation: approximately 0.2956663328, which rounds to 0.2956663328 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
