The definite integral \(\int_0^2 \ln\frac{2+\sqrt{4-x^2}}{x} I_1(3x) \, dx\) is evaluated through a combination of analytical insights and numerical approximation. 

1. **Analytical Approach**:
   - The integral is recognized to involve a logarithmic term and the modified Bessel function of the first kind. 
   - Various substitutions and series expansions are explored, but the exact analytical solution is found to be non-trivial and requires advanced techniques or known integrals not readily derivable through elementary methods.
   - The exact result is hypothesized to relate to exponential functions based on the behavior of the Bessel function and logarithmic terms. 

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using computational tools, the integral is numerically evaluated with high precision. The result is approximated to 10 decimal places.

The final answer is presented as follows:
