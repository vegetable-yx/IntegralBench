Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 1 to e of cos(ln x)/x dx. Hmm, first, I should recall some integration techniques. The integrand is cos(ln x) divided by x. The presence of ln x makes me think substitution might be useful here. Let me try substituting u = ln x. Then, the derivative of ln x is 1/x, so du = (1/x) dx. That's perfect because the integrand has a 1/x dx term. So substituting, when x is 1, u = ln 1 = 0, and when x is e, u = ln e = 1. So the integral becomes the integral from u=0 to u=1 of cos(u) du. That's straightforward. The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), so evaluating from 0 to 1 gives sin(1) - sin(0). Sin(0) is 0, so the exact answer is sin(1). 

Wait, let me check that again. The substitution steps: Let u = ln x, then du = (1/x) dx. So (1/x) dx is replaced by du, and cos(ln x) becomes cos(u). So the integral becomes ∫cos(u) du from 0 to 1. Yes, that's right. So integrating cos(u) gives sin(u), so the limits are sin(1) - sin(0) = sin(1) - 0 = sin(1). So the exact answer is sin(1). 

Now, for the numerical approximation. I need to compute sin(1) where the 1 is in radians. Let me remember that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. The value of sin(1) is approximately 0.8414709848. Let me check that with a calculator. Yes, sin(1 radian) is approximately 0.8414709848. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8414709848.

Wait, but let me confirm using a calculator steps. Let me compute sin(1) numerically. Using a calculator, 1 radian. The Taylor series for sin(x) is x - x^3/6 + x^5/120 - x^7/5040 + ... For x=1, that's 1 - 1/6 + 1/120 - 1/5040 + ... Let's compute up to a few terms. 1 = 1. Then subtract 1/6 ≈ 0.1666666667, so 0.8333333333. Then add 1/120 ≈ 0.0083333333, so 0.8416666666. Subtract 1/5040 ≈ 0.0001984127, so 0.8414682539. Next term is +1/362880 ≈ 0.0000027557, so 0.8414710096. Then subtract 1/39916800 ≈ 0.0000000255, so approximately 0.8414709841. So up to that term, it's about 0.8414709841. So rounding to 10 decimal places, 0.8414709841 would be 0.8414709841, but maybe the calculator gives more precise value. Let me check with a calculator. Yes, sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848078965. So rounding to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8414709848. So the numerical answer is 0.8414709848.

So putting it all together, the exact answer is sin(1) in LaTeX, which is \sin(1), and the numerical approximation is 0.8414709848. Therefore, the JSON should be {"answer": "\\sin(1)", "numerical_answer": 0.8414709848}. Let me just make sure there are no mistakes in the steps. The substitution was correct, the integral of cos(u) is sin(u), evaluated from 0 to 1. Yes, that's right. So the exact answer is indeed sin(1), and the numerical value is as calculated.
