Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 1 to e of cos(ln x)/x dx. Hmm, where do I start?

First, I remember that integrals involving ln x often use substitution. The integrand here is cos(ln x) divided by x. Let me think about substitution. If I let u be ln x, then du would be 1/x dx. Oh, right! Because the derivative of ln x is 1/x. So that 1/x dx is already part of the integrand. That seems promising.

So substitution: u = ln x. Then du = (1/x) dx. That means the integral becomes the integral of cos(u) du. But wait, I need to adjust the limits of integration when I substitute. When x is 1, u = ln 1 = 0. When x is e, u = ln e = 1. So the new limits are from 0 to 1.

So the integral simplifies to the integral from u=0 to u=1 of cos(u) du. That's straightforward. The integral of cos(u) is sin(u) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1, it would be sin(1) - sin(0). Sin(0) is 0, so the exact answer is sin(1).

Wait, let me double-check. The substitution steps: dx/x is du, so the integral becomes ∫cos(u) du from 0 to 1. Yes, that's right. So the exact value is sin(1) - sin(0) = sin(1). Since sin(0) is 0. So the exact answer is sin(1). 

Now, for the numerical approximation. I need to compute sin(1) where the angle is in radians. Let me recall that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. The value of sin(1) radians is about 0.8414709848. Let me check with a calculator. Yes, sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848078965. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.8414709848.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. The substitution was correct. Original integral: ∫₁^e [cos(ln x)/x] dx. Let u = ln x, du = (1/x)dx. So when x=1, u=0; x=e, u=1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ cos(u) du = sin(u) from 0 to 1 = sin(1) - sin(0) = sin(1). Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is sin(1), and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.8414709848. 

I think that's all. No steps seem missing. The substitution is straightforward here. Maybe I should check if there's another method, but I don't think it's necessary. The substitution method works perfectly here. So the final answer should be sin(1) in LaTeX and the numerical value as calculated.
