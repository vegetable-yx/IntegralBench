Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The integral is from 0 to 1 of |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| dx. Hmm, that's a nested absolute value function. I need to break it down to handle the absolute values one by one. 

First, let's understand the innermost part: |1 - x|. Since x is between 0 and 1, 1 - x is non-negative, so |1 - x| is just 1 - x. Then, the next layer is |1 - |1 - x||, which becomes |1 - (1 - x)| = |x|. But x is between 0 and 1, so |x| is just x. Then the outermost absolute value is |1 - x|. Wait, so putting it all together, the integrand simplifies to |1 - x|. But wait, let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me parse the expression again. The integrand is |1 - |1 - |1 - x|||. Let's start from the inside:

1. Innermost: |1 - x|. Since x ∈ [0,1], 1 - x ≥ 0, so |1 - x| = 1 - x.

2. Next layer: |1 - |1 - x|| = |1 - (1 - x)| = |x|. Since x is in [0,1], |x| = x.

3. Outermost: |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| = |1 - x|. Because the previous step gave x, so |1 - x| again. Wait, so the entire integrand simplifies to |1 - x| over [0,1]? But that seems too straightforward. Let me verify with specific points.

Let's test x = 0.5. Then |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. Then |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. Then |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. So the integrand at x=0.5 is 0.5. If the integrand is |1 - x|, then at x=0.5, that's also 0.5. So maybe that's correct. But let's check another point, say x=0.25.

Innermost: |1 - 0.25| = 0.75. Then |1 - 0.75| = 0.25. Then |1 - 0.25| = 0.75. Wait, that's different. Wait, wait, no. Let's do it step by step:

For x=0.25:

1. |1 - x| = |1 - 0.25| = 0.75.

2. |1 - |1 - x|| = |1 - 0.75| = |0.25| = 0.25.

3. |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| = |1 - 0.25| = 0.75.

So at x=0.25, the integrand is 0.75. But if the integrand were |1 - x|, at x=0.25, that's 0.75 as well. Wait, so maybe the entire function is |1 - x|? Let's check x=0.75.

1. |1 - 0.75| = 0.25.

2. |1 - 0.25| = 0.75.

3. |1 - 0.75| = 0.25.

So here, the integrand is 0.25. But |1 - x| at x=0.75 is 0.25. So again, same result. Wait, so maybe the entire function simplifies to |1 - x| over [0,1]. But that seems to be the case here. Let me check x=0.1:

1. |1 - 0.1| = 0.9.

2. |1 - 0.9| = 0.1.

3. |1 - 0.1| = 0.9. So integrand is 0.9, which is |1 - 0.1| = 0.9. Similarly, x=0.9:

1. |1 - 0.9| = 0.1.

2. |1 - 0.1| = 0.9.

3. |1 - 0.9| = 0.1. Which is |1 - 0.9| = 0.1. So in all these cases, the integrand equals |1 - x|. Therefore, the entire integrand simplifies to |1 - x| over [0,1]. Therefore, the integral is the integral from 0 to 1 of |1 - x| dx. But since 1 - x is non-negative on [0,1], |1 - x| = 1 - x. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - x) dx.

Wait, but that seems too easy. Let me confirm again. Let's take x=0.5 again. The integrand is |1 - |1 - |1 - 0.5||| = |1 - |1 - 0.5|| = |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. Which is indeed 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. So yes, the integrand simplifies to 1 - x over [0,1]. Therefore, the integral is ∫₀¹ (1 - x) dx. Then integrating that gives [x - (x²)/2] from 0 to 1. Plugging in 1: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Plugging in 0: 0. So the integral is 1/2. The numerical approximation is 0.5. But wait, this seems too straightforward. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the absolute values. Let me check another point where x is greater than 1, but since our interval is [0,1], maybe it's okay. Wait, but let's check x=0. Let's see:

At x=0:

1. |1 - 0| = 1.

2. |1 - 1| = 0.

3. |1 - 0| = 1. So integrand is 1. Which is 1 - 0 = 1. Correct.

At x=1:

1. |1 - 1| = 0.

2. |1 - 0| = 1.

3. |1 - 1| = 0. So integrand is 0. Which is 1 - 1 = 0. Correct.

So indeed, the integrand is 1 - x over [0,1]. Therefore, the integral is 1/2. But wait, wait, but the problem says "definite integral of |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| dx from 0 to 1". If the integrand simplifies to 1 - x, then the integral is 1/2. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me parse the expression again. The integrand is |1 - |1 - |1 - x|||. Let's parse it step by step:

Start with the innermost absolute value: |1 - x|. Then, compute |1 - (result)|, then take the absolute value of 1 minus that result.

So:

Let me define f(x) = |1 - |1 - |1 - x|||.

Compute f(x):

First, compute the innermost part: |1 - x|. Let's call this A = |1 - x|.

Then, compute B = |1 - A|.

Then, compute C = |1 - B|.

So f(x) = C.

Let's compute A, B, C for different intervals of x.

Since x is in [0,1], let's see how A, B, C behave.

Case 1: x ∈ [0,1]

A = |1 - x| = 1 - x (since x ≤ 1).

Then B = |1 - (1 - x)| = |x| = x (since x ≥ 0).

Then C = |1 - x| = 1 - x (since x ∈ [0,1], 1 - x ≥ 0).

Therefore, f(x) = 1 - x for all x in [0,1].

Therefore, the integrand simplifies to 1 - x over [0,1], so the integral is ∫₀¹ (1 - x) dx.

Integrating:

∫ (1 - x) dx from 0 to 1 = [x - x²/2] from 0 to 1 = (1 - 1/2) - (0 - 0) = 1/2.

So the exact answer is 1/2, and the numerical approximation is 0.5.

But wait, the problem seems to have a more complex structure. Let me check again with a different approach. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the entire interval [0,1] behaves the same way. Let's consider if there are points where the expression inside the absolute values changes sign, which would split the integral into different intervals.

But according to the previous analysis, since x is in [0,1], each step simplifies without any sign changes. Let me verify with x=0.5 again:

A = |1 - 0.5| = 0.5

B = |1 - 0.5| = 0.5

C = |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, B is |1 - A|, which when A=0.5, B=0.5. Then C is |1 - B| = |1 - 0.5| = 0.5. So f(0.5)=0.5, which is 1 - 0.5=0.5. Correct.

But let's take x=0.25:

A = 0.75

B = |1 - 0.75| = 0.25

C = |1 - 0.25| = 0.75. Wait, but 1 - x here is 0.75, which matches C. So f(x) = 0.75 = 1 - 0.25. Wait, 1 - x when x=0.25 is 0.75. So yes, f(x) = 1 - x.

Wait, x=0.75:

A = 0.25

B = |1 - 0.25| = 0.75

C = |1 - 0.75| = 0.25. Which is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. Correct.

So in all cases, f(x) = 1 - x. Therefore, the integral is indeed ∫₀¹ (1 - x) dx = 1/2.

But the problem mentions "definite integral of |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| dx from 0 to 1". If the integrand simplifies to 1 - x, then the answer is 1/2. But maybe I'm missing a step where the expression inside the absolute values could change sign. Let me check for x outside [0,1], but since the integral is from 0 to 1, x is within [0,1], so all steps hold.

Therefore, the exact answer is 1/2, and the numerical approximation is 0.5. So the JSON output should be:

{"answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "numerical_answer": 0.5000000000}

But wait, let me confirm once more. Let's compute the integral step by step again.

Integral of 1 - x from 0 to 1:

Antiderivative is x - x²/2. Evaluated at 1: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. At 0: 0. So yes, 1/2. So the answer is correct.
