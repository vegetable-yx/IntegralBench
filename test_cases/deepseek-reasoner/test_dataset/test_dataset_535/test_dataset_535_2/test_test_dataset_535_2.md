Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to e^e of [log(x^{log(x^x)}) / x²] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the integrand first.

First, let's look at the logarithm part: log(x^{log(x^x)}). Remember that log(a^b) = b*log(a), so applying that here, we can bring down the exponent. So that becomes log(x^x) * log(x). Wait, but log(x^x) is another logarithm. Let me check: log(x^x) is x*log(x), right? Because log(a^b) = b*log(a). So substituting that in, the numerator becomes x*log(x) * log(x) = x*(log(x))². So the integrand simplifies to [x*(log(x))²] / x², which is (log(x))² / x.

Wait, let me verify that again. Original integrand: log(x^{log(x^x)}) / x². Let's break down the exponent: log(x^x) is x*log(x), so the argument of the logarithm is x^{x log x}. Then log(x^{x log x}) is x log x * log x, which is x (log x)^2. So the numerator is x (log x)^2, and then we divide by x², so the integrand becomes (x (log x)^2) / x² = (log x)^2 / x. So the integral simplifies to ∫ (ln x)^2 / x dx from 1 to e^e. That's much better.

Now, the integral of (ln x)^2 / x dx. Let me make a substitution. Let u = ln x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So the integral becomes ∫ u² du. That's straightforward. The integral of u² is (u³)/3 + C. So substituting back, we get ( (ln x)^3 ) / 3. Therefore, the definite integral from 1 to e^e is [ (ln(e^e))^3 / 3 ] - [ (ln 1)^3 / 3 ].

Now compute the limits. First, the upper limit: ln(e^e) is e * ln e, and ln e is 1, so that's e. So (e)^3 / 3. The lower limit: ln 1 is 0, so 0)^3 /3 is 0. Therefore, the exact value is e³ / 3.

Wait, but let me check the substitution again. When I set u = ln x, then when x = e^e, u = ln(e^e) = e. And when x =1, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=0 to u=e of u² du, which is [u³/3] from 0 to e, which is e³/3 - 0 = e³/3. So that's correct.

Now, the numerical approximation. e is approximately 2.718281828459045. So e³ is e * e * e. Let's compute that. First, e squared is about 7.38905609893. Then multiply by e again: 7.38905609893 * 2.718281828459045. Let me calculate that. 7 * 2.71828 is about 19.02796, 0.389056 * 2.71828 ≈ 1.057. So total approx 20.085. But more accurately, e³ is known to be approximately 20.0855369232. Then divide by 3: 20.0855369232 /3 ≈ 6.6951789744. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 6.6951789744.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me check e^3:

e ≈ 2.718281828459045

e squared: 2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

Let me compute that step by step:

2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045

First, 2 * 2.71828 is 5.43656, but actually, let's use a calculator approach. e squared is approximately 7.389056098930649. Then e cubed is 7.389056098930649 * 2.718281828459045.

Multiplying 7.389056098930649 by 2.718281828459045:

Let me compute this:

7 * 2.71828 = 19.02796

0.389056 * 2.71828 ≈ 0.389056 * 2 = 0.778112, 0.389056 * 0.71828 ≈ 0.2795. So total ≈ 0.778112 + 0.2795 ≈ 1.0576. So total e³ ≈ 19.02796 + 1.0576 ≈ 20.08556. Then divide by 3: 20.08556 /3 ≈ 6.695186666...

But more accurately, using a calculator, e³ is approximately 20.085536923187668, so divided by 3 gives approximately 6.695178974395889. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 6.6951789744.

So the exact answer is e³/3, and the numerical approximation is approximately 6.6951789744.

I think that's all. Let me just check if I made any mistakes in substitution steps. The original integrand was log(x^{log(x^x)})/x². We simplified log(x^{log(x^x)}) as log(x^{x log x}) which is x log x * log x, which is x (log x)^2. Then divided by x² gives (log x)^2 /x. Then substitution u = ln x, du = dx/x. So the integral becomes u² du from 0 to e, which is e³/3. All steps seem correct. The answer should be correct.
