Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to e^e of [log(x^{log(x^x)}) / x²] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the integrand first.

First, let's simplify the logarithm part. The expression inside the log is x raised to the power of log(x^x). Let me recall logarithm properties. Remember that log(a^b) = b*log(a), so maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, the logarithm of x^{log(x^x)}. So applying the power rule, that would be log(x^x) multiplied by log(x). Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. The expression is log(x^{log(x^x)}). So using log(a^b) = b*log(a), so this becomes log(x^x) * log(x). Wait, log(x^x is another logarithm. Let me compute log(x^x). Since log(x^x) is x*log(x), right? Because log(a^b) = b*log(a). So log(x^x) = x log(x). Therefore, the original expression log(x^{log(x^x)}) becomes log(x^{x log x}) which is (x log x) * log x, because again, log(a^b) = b log a. So that's x (log x)^2. So the integrand simplifies to x (log x)^2 divided by x squared, which is (log x)^2 / x.

Wait, let me verify that again. The original integrand is log(x^{log(x^x)}) / x². Let's break it down:

log(x^{log(x^x)}) = log(x^x * log x) ? Wait, no. Wait, log(x^{A}) where A is log(x^x). So log(x^{A}) = A * log x. So A is log(x^x) which is x log x. Therefore, log(x^{log(x^x)}) = (x log x) * log x = x (log x)^2. Then divide by x², so the integrand becomes [x (log x)^2] / x² = (log x)^2 / x. So the integral simplifies to ∫ (ln x)^2 / x dx from 1 to e^e. That's much simpler!

Now, the integral of (ln x)^2 / x dx. Let me make a substitution. Let u = ln x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So the integral becomes ∫ u² du. That's straightforward. The integral of u² is (u³)/3 + C. So substituting back, we get ( (ln x)^3 ) / 3 + C. Therefore, the definite integral from 1 to e^e is [ (ln(e^e))^3 / 3 ] - [ (ln 1)^3 / 3 ].

Compute each term. First, ln(e^e) is e * ln e = e * 1 = e. So the first term is e³ / 3. The second term, ln 1 is 0, so 0)^3 /3 is 0. Therefore, the exact value of the integral is e³ / 3.

Now, for the numerical approximation. e is approximately 2.718281828459045. So e³ is approximately 2.718281828459045^3. Let me compute that. 2.71828^3. Let's compute step by step. 2.71828 * 2.71828 = let's see, 2.71828 squared is approximately 7.389056098. Then multiply by 2.71828 again: 7.389056098 * 2.71828 ≈ 20.0855369232. So e³ ≈ 20.0855369232. Then divided by 3 gives approximately 6.6951789744. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 6.6951789744.

Wait, let me check the exact value again. The integral is from 1 to e^e. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the upper limit is e^e, not e. So ln(e^e) is e, right? Because ln(e^e) = e * ln e = e*1 = e. So that part is correct. But the substitution steps are correct. So the integral is indeed (e^3)/3 - 0. So the exact answer is e³ /3. The numerical approximation is approximately 20.0855369232 /3 ≈ 6.6951789744. Let me confirm with a calculator. e ≈ 2.718281828459045, so e is about 2.71828^1 is 2.71828, but e^e is e raised to the e power. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, the upper limit is e^e, not e. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Oh no! Wait, the upper limit is x = e^e, so when we substitute u = ln x, then u = ln(e^e) = e. So that's correct. So the upper limit is e, and the lower limit is ln(1) = 0. So the integral becomes from u=0 to u=e of u² du, which is [u³/3] from 0 to e, which is e³/3 - 0. So the exact answer is e³/3. Therefore, the numerical value is as calculated. So 20.0855369232 /3 ≈ 6.6951789744. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 6.6951789744. Let me check with more precise calculation. Let me compute e^3 exactly. e is approximately 2.71828182845904523536, so e^3 is 2.71828182845904523536^3. Let's compute that:

First, 2.718281828459045 * 2.718281828459045 = let's compute 2.71828^2 first. 2.71828 * 2.71828 = 7.3890560983. Then multiply by 2.71828 again: 7.3890560983 * 2.71828. Let's compute that:

7.3890560983 * 2 = 14.7781121966

7.3890560983 * 0.7 = 5.17233926881

7.3890560983 * 0.01828 ≈ 7.3890560983 * 0.01 = 0.073890560983, 7.00828 * 0.00828 ≈ 0.058, so total ≈ 0.073890560983 + 0.058 ≈ 0.13189. So adding up: 14.7781121966 + 5.17233926881 = 19.9504514654 + 0.13189 ≈ 20.0823414654. But this is an approximate way. Alternatively, using a calculator, e^3 is approximately 20.085536923187668. So divided by 3 is approximately 6.695178974395889. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 6.6951789744.

So the exact answer is e³/3, and the numerical approximation is approximately 6.6951789744. Therefore, the final JSON should be {"answer": "\dfrac{e^3}{3}", "numerical_answer": 6.6951789744}.
