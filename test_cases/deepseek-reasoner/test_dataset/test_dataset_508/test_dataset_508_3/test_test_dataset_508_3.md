Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 441 of (π sin(π√x))/√x dx. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but maybe substitution will help. 

First, the integrand has √x in both the numerator and denominator. Let me think. The function is π sin(π√x) divided by √x. So, if I let u be something involving √x, maybe that would simplify things. Let's try substitution. Let u = π√x. Then, what's du/dx? 

The derivative of u with respect to x is π*(1/(2√x)). So, du = π/(2√x) dx. Wait, the integrand has 1/√x dx. Let me rearrange that. If du = π/(2√x) dx, then (2/π) du = 1/√x dx. That's useful because the integrand has 1/√x dx multiplied by π sin(u). 

Let me write that out. The original integral is ∫π sin(u) / √x dx. But since u = π√x, then √x = u/π. Wait, but maybe I can substitute in terms of u. Let's see. 

Original integral: ∫ (π sin(π√x)) / √x dx from 0 to 441.

Substitute u = π√x. Then, du/dx = π*(1/(2√x)) => dx = (2√x)/π du. But √x is u/π, so dx = (2*(u/π))/π du = (2u)/(π²) du. 

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me re-express the integral in terms of u. Let me substitute t = √x. Then, x = t², so dx = 2t dt. Then, the integral becomes ∫ (π sin(π t))/t * 2t dt, because √x is t, so 1/√x is 1/t. Wait, substituting t = √x, then when x goes from 0 to 441, t goes from 0 to 21. 

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=21 of (π sin(π t))/t * 2t dt. The t in the denominator and the 2t from dx would cancel out one t. So, 2t / t = 2. Therefore, the integral simplifies to ∫0^21 π sin(π t) * 2 dt. 

Wait, that's much simpler! So, the integral becomes 2π ∫0^21 sin(π t) dt. Let me check that again. Original integrand: π sin(π√x)/√x dx. Substitute t = √x, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then, substituting into the integral: π sin(π t)/t * 2t dt. The t's cancel, so we have π * 2 sin(π t) dt. So 2π ∫ sin(π t) dt from 0 to 21. 

Yes, that's right. So integrating sin(π t) with respect to t. The integral of sin(a t) dt is -1/a cos(a t) + C. So here, a = π. Therefore, the integral becomes 2π [ -1/π cos(π t) ] from 0 to 21. 

Simplify that: 2π [ (-1/π)(cos(21π) - cos(0)) ] = 2π [ (-1/π)(cos(21π) - 1) ] = 2π * (-1/π)(cos(21π) - 1) = 2*(-1)*(cos(21π) - 1) = -2*(cos(21π) - 1) = 2*(1 - cos(21π)). 

Now, cos(21π). Since cosine has a period 2π, so cos(21π) = cos(π*(20 +1)) = cos(π + 20π) = cos(π + 10*2π) = cos(π) because cosine is periodic with period 2π. So cos(21π) = cos(π) = -1. 

Therefore, 2*(1 - (-1)) = 2*(2) = 4. So the exact value of the integral is 4. 

Wait, that's a nice result. Let me verify again. 

Original substitution: t = √x, so when x=0, t=0; x=441, t=21. The integral becomes 2π ∫0^21 sin(π t) dt. The integral of sin(π t) is -1/π cos(π t). Evaluated from 0 to 21: -1/π [cos(21π) - cos(0)] = -1/π [ (-1) - 1 ] = -1/π (-2) = 2/π. Then multiply by 2π: 2π*(2/π) = 4. Yes, that's correct. 

So the exact answer is 4. Then, the numerical approximation is 4.0000000000. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any mistake here. Let me check the substitution again. 

Original integral: ∫0^441 [π sin(π√x)] / √x dx. Let t = √x, so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then, substituting into the integral: [π sin(π t)] / t * 2t dt. The t in the denominator cancels with the 2t from dx, giving 2π sin(π t) dt. So the integral is 2π ∫0^21 sin(π t) dt. 

Integrate sin(π t) from 0 to 21: (-1/π)[cos(π t)] from 0 to21 = (-1/π)[cos(21π) - cos(0)] = (-1/π)[(-1) - 1] = (-1/π)(-2) = 2/π. Multiply by 2π: 2π*(2/π) = 4. 

Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. 

But wait, is there any chance that the substitution was wrong? Let me check with another substitution. Suppose I use u = π√x. Then du = π/(2√x) dx. So, dx = (2√x)/π du. But √x = u/π, so dx = 2*(u/π)/π du = 2u/(π²) du. Then, the integral becomes ∫ [π sin(u)] / (u/π) * [2u/(π²) du]. Let's compute that. 

The integrand is π sin(u) divided by (u/π) times 2u/π² du. So, π sin(u) * π/u * 2u/π² du. Simplify: π * π / u * 2u / π² = (π² * 2u) / (u π²) ) = 2. So the integrand becomes 2 sin(u) du. The limits when x=0, u=0; x=441, u=π*21. So the integral is 2 ∫0^{21π} sin(u) du. 

Integrate sin(u) is -cos(u). Evaluated from 0 to 21π: -cos(21π) + cos(0) = -(-1) + 1 = 1 +1 = 2. Multiply by 2: 2*2=4. Same result. 

So both substitutions lead to the same answer. Therefore, the exact answer is 4. The numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. 

Therefore, the final answer is 4. So the JSON should be {"answer": "4", "numerical_answer": "4.0000000000"}.
