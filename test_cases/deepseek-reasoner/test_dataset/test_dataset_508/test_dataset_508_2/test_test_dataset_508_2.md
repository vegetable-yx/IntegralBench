Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 441 of (π sin(π√x))/√x dx. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but maybe substitution will help. Let me start by recalling substitution techniques.

First, the integrand is π sin(π√x) divided by √x. The presence of √x in both the argument and the denominator suggests that a substitution involving √x might be useful. Let me try letting u = π√x. Then, du/dx would be π*(1/(2√x)). Wait, let me check that derivative. If u = π√x, then du/dx = π*(1/(2√x)). So, rearranging, du = (π/(2√x)) dx. Hmm, but in the integrand, we have π/(√x) dx. Let me see. If I solve for dx in terms of du, I get dx = (2√x/π) du. But since u = π√x, √x is u/π. So substituting that in, dx = 2(u/π)/π du = 2u/(π²) du. Wait, maybe I should handle the substitution step by step.

Let me try substitution again. Let’s set t = √x. Then, dt/dx = 1/(2√x), so dx = 2√x dt. But since t = √x, √x is t, so dx = 2t dt. Let's substitute into the integral. The original integral becomes:

π sin(π t) / t * 2t dt, with the limits adjusted. When x=0, t=0, and when x=441, t=√441=21. So the integral becomes π * ∫ from 0=0 to t1=21 of [sin(π t)/t] * 2t dt. The t in the denominator and the 2t from dx would give 2π ∫ sin(π t) dt from 0 to 21. Oh, that's a simplification! Because the t cancels out. So the integral simplifies to 2π ∫ sin(π t) dt from 0 to 21.

Now, integrating sin(π t) with respect to t. The integral of sin(π t) is (-1/π) cos(π t) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 21:

2π [ (-1/π cos(π t)) ] from 0 to 21 = 2π [ (-1/π cos(21π)) - (-1/π cos(0)) ].

Simplify this expression. The 2π multiplied by the terms inside:

2π * [ (-1/π cos(21π) + 1/π cos(0)) ] = 2π * [ (-cos(21π) + cos(0)) / π ].

The π in the denominator cancels with the 2π, leaving 2 [ -cos(21π) + cos(0) ].

Now, cos(0) is 1. What's cos(21π)? Since cosine has a period of 2π, cos(21π) = cos(π*(20 +1)) = cos(π + 20π) = cos(π + even multiple of π). Wait, 21π is the same as π plus 20π. Since 20 is even, 20π is equivalent to 0 modulo 2π. So cos(21π) = cos(π) = -1. Therefore, substituting back:

2 [ -(-1) + 1 ] = 2 [1 + 1] = 2*2 = 4. So the exact value of the integral is 4.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. The substitution steps: t = √x, dx = 2t dt. Then the integrand becomes π sin(π t)/t * 2t dt. The t's cancel, leaving 2π sin(π t) dt. Then integrating from 0 to 21. The integral of sin(π t) is (-1/π) cos(π t), so evaluated at 21 and 0. Then 2π times [ (-1/π)(cos(21π) - cos(0)) ].

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me redo that part. The integral from 0 to 21 of sin(π t) dt is [ -1/π cos(π t) ] from 0 to 21. So that's (-1/π)(cos(21π) - cos(0)). Then multiplying by 2π gives 2π*(-1/π)(cos(21π) - cos(0)) = -2 [cos(21π) - cos(0)] = -2 [ (-1) - 1 ] = -2*(-2) = 4. Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is 4.

For the numerical approximation, since the exact answer is 4, the numerical value is 4.0000000000. But let me confirm that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by substitution u = π√x. Let's try that.

Let u = π√x. Then du/dx = π*(1/(2√x)). So dx = (2√x)/π du. But √x is u/π, so dx = 2(u/π)/π du = 2u/(π²) du. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (π sin u)/√x * dx. But √x is u/π, so 1/√x = π/u. Therefore, the integrand becomes π sin u * (π/u) * (2u)/(π²) du. Let's compute that: π*(π/u)*(2u/π²) = π * π * 2u / (u * π²) ) = 2. So the integrand simplifies to 2 sin u du. The limits when x=0, u=0; x=441, u=π*21. So the integral becomes 2 ∫ from 0 to 21π of sin u du. The integral of sin u is -cos u. So evaluating from 0 to 21π: 2 [ -cos(21π) + cos(0) ].

Again, cos(21π) = cos(π*(20 +1)) = cos(π + 10*2π) = cos(π) = -1. So this becomes 2 [ -(-1) + 1 ] = 2*(1 +1) = 4. Same result. So exact answer is 4. Therefore, numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000.

So the answer is 4, both analytically and numerically. Therefore, the JSON output should be {"answer": "4", "numerical_answer": "4.0000000000"}.
