Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of arccos(x) multiplied by the Dirac delta function D(0.5x) dx. Hmm, first, I need to recall how the Dirac delta function works in integrals. The Dirac delta function δ(x) is zero everywhere except at x=0, and its integral over any interval containing zero is 1. Also, there's a scaling property: δ(ax) = (1/|a|)δ(x). So in this case, we have δ(0.5x). Let me check that scaling property again. If a is positive, then δ(ax) = (1/a)δ(x). Here, a is 0.5, which is positive, so δ(0.5x) = 2δ(x). Wait, but the integral is from 0 to 1. The delta function δ(0.5x) would be 2δ(x), but we need to see where the argument of the delta function is zero. 0.5x = 0 implies x=0. So the delta function is centered at x=0. But the integral is from 0 to 1. However, the delta function at x=0 is included in the interval. So the integral becomes the integrand evaluated at x=0 multiplied by the scaling factor. Let me write this out.

The integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) * δ(0.5x) dx. Using the scaling property, δ(0.5x) = 2δ(x). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ arccos(x) * 2δ(x) dx. Then, by the sifting property of the delta function, this equals 2 * arccos(0) evaluated at x=0. arccos(0) is π/2. So the integral should be 2*(π/2) = π. Wait, but let me check if the interval includes the point where the delta function is non-zero. Since the integral is from 0 to 1, and the delta function is at x=0, which is the lower limit. The integral over [0,1] includes the point x=0, so the delta function contributes. Therefore, the exact answer is π. 

But let me verify this again. The scaling factor for δ(kx) is 1/|k|. Here, k is 0.5, so 1/0.5 is 2. So δ(0.5x) = 2δ(x). Then, integrating arccos(x) * 2δ(x) from 0 to 1 is 2 * arccos(0) * 1 (since the integral of δ(x) over [0,1] is 0.5? Wait, no. Wait, the integral of δ(x) from -∞ to ∞ is 1. But here, we are integrating from 0 to 1. The delta function at x=0 is at the endpoint. How does that affect the integral? Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Some sources say that if the delta function is at the endpoint of the interval, the integral is half the value. Wait, but I need to be careful here. The definition of the Dirac delta function's integral over an interval that includes the point is 1 if the interval includes the point in its interior, but if the point is at the boundary, there's a debate. However, in standard practice, when integrating δ(x) from 0 to a, where a >0, the integral is 1, because the delta function is considered to be included. Wait, actually, the integral from -ε to ε of δ(x) dx is 1 for any ε>0. So if we integrate from 0 to 1, the delta function at 0 is included, so the integral of δ(x) from 0 to 1 is 1. Therefore, in this case, the scaling factor is 2, and the integral becomes 2 * arccos(0) * 1. arccos(0) is π/2. So 2*(π/2) = π. Therefore, the exact answer is π. 

But let me check another source. According to the properties of the Dirac delta function, ∫ δ(x) dx from a to b is 1 if a < 0 < b, 0.5 if a=0 or b=0 (but this is not standard). Wait, actually, the standard definition is that the integral over an interval that includes the point is 1, regardless of whether the endpoints are included. So if the interval is [0,1], then x=0 is included, and the integral of δ(x) over [0,1] is 1. Therefore, the scaling factor is 2, and the integral becomes 2 * arccos(0) = 2*(π/2) = π. So the exact answer is π. 

Therefore, the analytical solution is π. The numerical approximation would be approximately 3.1415926536. Let me confirm that. π is approximately 3.141592653589793, so rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 3.1415926536. 

Wait, but let me make sure there's no mistake in the scaling. The original problem has δ(0.5x). So δ(kx) = (1/|k|)δ(x). Here, k=0.5, so 1/0.5=2. So δ(0.5x)=2δ(x). Then, the integral becomes 2*arccos(0) evaluated at x=0. arccos(0) is indeed π/2. So 2*(π/2)=π. Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the exact answer is π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 3.1415926536.
