Okay, let's tackle this integral ∫₀¹ arccos(x) D(0.5x) dx. Hmm, first I need to understand what D(0.5x) means. Wait, in some contexts, D might represent the Dirac delta function. But the Dirac delta function is usually denoted by δ(x), so maybe D here is the delta function? The problem statement says "D(0.5x)", so that would be δ(0.5x). But I should confirm if that's the case. Since the user mentioned it's a definite integral involving the Dirac delta, I'll proceed under that assumption.

The Dirac delta function δ(ax) can be rewritten as δ(x)/|a|. So δ(0.5x) would be δ(x)/0.5, which is 2δ(x). But wait, the integral is from 0 to 1. The delta function δ(x) is zero everywhere except at x=0. However, the interval includes x=0. So integrating arccos(x) times 2δ(x) from 0 to 1 would pick up the value of the function at x=0 multiplied by 2. But arccos(0) is π/2. So the integral would be 2 * (π/2) = π. But wait, let me check the properties again.

Wait, the scaling property of the Dirac delta: δ(ax) = δ(x)/|a|. So if a is 0.5, then δ(0.5x) = δ(x)/0.5 = 2δ(x). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ arccos(x) * 2δ(x) dx. Since the delta function is at x=0, which is within the limits of integration, the integral evaluates to 2 * arccos(0) * 1 (since the integral of δ(x) over an interval including 0 is 1). arccos(0) is π/2. So 2*(π/2) = π. Therefore, the exact answer is π. Numerically, π is approximately 3.1415926536. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 3.1415926536.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The integral is from 0 to 1, and the delta function is at x=0. So the evaluation at x=0 is valid. The function arccos(x) is continuous at x=0, so there's no issue. Therefore, the integral should indeed be π. Let me just verify with another approach. Suppose we consider the integral ∫ arccos(x) * 2δ(x) dx from -∞ to ∞, which would be 2*arccos(0) = π. But our integral is from 0 to 1. However, since the delta function is at x=0, which is the lower limit, and the integral from 0 to 1 includes the point x=0, the result is the same as integrating over the entire real line here. So yes, the answer is π. Therefore, the exact answer is π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 3.1415926536.
