Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of (1/x) times the square root of (2 squared minus x squared) times arctan(x) dx. Let me write that out again to make sure I have it right: ∫₀² (1/x) * √(4 - x²) * arctan(x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the integrand has three components: 1/x, sqrt(4 - x²), and arctan(x). The presence of arctan(x) suggests that integration by parts might be useful here. Remember, integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. Let me try to choose u and dv appropriately.

But before that, maybe check if there's a substitution that can simplify the expression. The sqrt(4 - x²) term reminds me of trigonometric substitutions, like x = 2 sinθ. Let's try that. If I set x = 2 sinθ, then dx = 2 cosθ dθ, and when x=0, θ=0, and when x=2, θ=π/2. Let's substitute:

The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(2 sinθ)] * √(4 - 4 sin²θ) * arctan(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ dθ.

Simplify the sqrt term: sqrt(4(1 - sin²θ)) = sqrt(4 cos²θ) = 2 cosθ. So plugging that in:

∫₀^{π/2} [1/(2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ * arctan(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ dθ.

Wait, let's compute the constants and terms:

1/(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ * 2 cosθ = (1/(2 sinθ)) * 2 cosθ * 2 cosθ = (2 cos²θ)/(sinθ). So the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (2 cos²θ / sinθ) * arctan(2 sinθ) dθ.

Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe integration by parts. Let me set u = arctan(x), so that du = 1/(1 + x²) dx. Then dv would be (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) dx. But integrating dv would require finding v, which is ∫ sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx. That might not straightforward. Let me check that integral.

Wait, maybe another substitution for the dv part. Let me set t = sqrt(4 - x²). Then dt/dx = (-x)/sqrt(4 - x²). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe set t = x², but not sure. Alternatively, for ∫ sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx, let me try substitution. Let u = sqrt(4 - x²), then du = (-x)/sqrt(4 - x²) dx. Hmm, but then x dx = -u du. Let me see:

Let me write the integral as ∫ sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx. Let u = sqrt(4 - x²). Then u² = 4 - x², so x² = 4 - u², and 2x dx = -2u du, so x dx = -u du. Hmm, but in the integral, we have sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx = u/x dx. From x dx = -u du, we can write dx = (-u/x) du. But x = sqrt(4 - u²). Wait, this might get complicated. Let me try another substitution.

Alternatively, for ∫ sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx, set x = 2 sinθ, which is similar to before. Then dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(4 - x²) = 2 cosθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (2 cosθ)/(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ dθ = ∫ (2 cos²θ)/sinθ dθ. Which is similar to the previous substitution. Then that would be 2 ∫ (cos²θ)/sinθ dθ. Let me compute that integral.

cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ, so (1 - sin²θ)/sinθ = 1/sinθ - sinθ. So the integral becomes 2 ∫ (cscθ - sinθ) dθ = 2 [ -ln |cscθ + cotθ| + cosθ ] + C. Then substituting back θ = arcsin(x/2). So cscθ = 1/sinθ = 2/x, cotθ = cosθ/sinθ = sqrt(1 - x²/4)/(x/2) = sqrt(4 - x²)/x. So the integral becomes 2 [ -ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x ) + sqrt(4 - x²)/2 ] + C. Wait, let me check:

Wait, when we have θ = arcsin(x/2), so cosθ = sqrt(1 - x²/4) = sqrt(4 - x²)/2. So cosθ = sqrt(4 - x²)/2. Therefore, the integral of dv is 2 [ -ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x ) + sqrt(4 - x²)/2 ] + C. Simplify that:

= -2 ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x ) + sqrt(4 - x²) + C.

So v = -2 ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x ) + sqrt(4 - x²).

But this seems complicated. So if we proceed with integration by parts, with u = arctan(x), dv = sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx, then du = 1/(1 + x²) dx, and v is as above.

Then integration by parts gives uv | from 0 to 2 - ∫ v du.

But this seems very messy. The term uv would be arctan(x) * [ -2 ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - x²))/x ) + sqrt(4 - x²) ] evaluated from 0 to 2. Then subtract the integral of v * 1/(1 + x²) dx. This seems too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, maybe consider a substitution that can combine arctan(x) and the other terms. Let me think. Another idea: since the integral is from 0 to 2, and sqrt(4 - x²) is involved, maybe polar coordinates or something else. Alternatively, series expansion of arctan(x)?

Let me recall that arctan(x) can be expressed as an integral: arctan(x) = ∫₀^x 1/(1 + t²) dt. Maybe switching the order of integration. Let me try that.

So the original integral is ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) arctan(x) dx = ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) [∫₀^x 1/(1 + t²) dt] dx.

Then switching the order of integration, the region of integration is 0 ≤ t ≤ x ≤ 2. So changing the order, t goes from 0 to 2, and x goes from t to 2. So the integral becomes ∫₀² [1/(1 + t²) ∫ₜ² sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx ] dt.

So now compute the inner integral ∫ₜ² sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx. Let me compute that first.

Let me set x = 2 sinθ, so dx = 2 cosθ dθ. When x = t, θ = arcsin(t/2), and when x = 2, θ = π/2. Then the integral becomes ∫_{arcsin(t/2)}^{π/2} [2 cosθ / (2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ dθ.

Simplify: [2 cosθ / (2 sinθ)] * 2 cosθ = (2 cos²θ)/sinθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (2 cos²θ)/sinθ dθ from θ = arcsin(t/2) to π/2.

As before, this integral is 2 ∫ (cos²θ)/sinθ dθ. Let me compute this integral again. As before, cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ, so split into 2 ∫ (1 - sin²θ)/sinθ dθ = 2 ∫ (cscθ - sinθ) dθ.

Integrate term by term: 2 [ -ln |cscθ + cotθ| + cosθ ] evaluated from arcsin(t/2) to π/2.

At θ = π/2: cscθ = 1, cotθ = 0, so -ln(1 + 0) + cos(π/2) = -ln(1) + 0 = 0. So the upper limit gives 0.

At θ = arcsin(t/2): Let's denote θ = arcsin(t/2). Then cscθ = 1/sinθ = 2/t, cotθ = cosθ/sinθ = sqrt(1 - (t²/4))/(t/2) = sqrt(4 - t²)/t. So cscθ + cotθ = (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t. Then -ln(cscθ + cotθ) = -ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ). Also, cosθ = sqrt(1 - t²/4) = sqrt(4 - t²)/2. So the lower limit evaluates to -ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) + sqrt(4 - t²)/2.

Therefore, the integral from arcsin(t/2) to π/2 is 2 [ 0 - ( -ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) + sqrt(4 - t²)/2 ) ] = 2 [ ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) - sqrt(4 - t²)/2 ].

So the inner integral ∫ₜ² sqrt(4 - x²)/x dx = 2 ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) - sqrt(4 - t²).

Therefore, the original integral becomes ∫₀² [1/(1 + t²)] [2 ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) - sqrt(4 - t²) ] dt.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe there's a simplification here. Let me write the integral as:

2 ∫₀² [ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) / (1 + t²) ] dt - ∫₀² [sqrt(4 - t²)/(1 + t²) ] dt.

So the original integral is split into two parts. Let me handle them separately.

First, let's compute the second integral: ∫₀² sqrt(4 - t²)/(1 + t²) dt. Let me consider substitution here. Let t = 2 sinφ, so dt = 2 cosφ dφ. When t=0, φ=0; t=2, φ=π/2. Then sqrt(4 - t²) = 2 cosφ. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [2 cosφ / (1 + 4 sin²φ)] * 2 cosφ dφ = 4 ∫₀^{π/2} cos²φ / (1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ.

Hmm, this might be manageable. Let me write cos²φ = 1 - sin²φ. So 4 ∫ (1 - sin²φ)/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ. Let me split this as 4 [ ∫ 1/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ - ∫ sin²φ/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ ].

For the first integral, ∫ 1/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ. Let me use substitution. Let’s recall that ∫ 1/(a + b sin²φ) dφ can be done using tanφ substitution. Let’s set u = tanφ, so sinφ = u / sqrt(1 + u²), and dφ = du/(1 + u²). Then the integral becomes ∫ [1 / (1 + 4(u²/(1 + u²)))] * du/(1 + u²) = ∫ [ (1 + u²) / (1 + u² + 4u²) ] * du/(1 + u²) = ∫ 1/(1 + 5u²) du = (1/√5) arctan(u√5) + C. So substituting back, u = tanφ, so the integral is (1/√5) arctan(√5 tanφ) + C. Evaluated from 0 to π/2. At π/2, tanφ approaches infinity, so arctan(√5 tanφ) approaches π/2. At 0, it's 0. So the first integral from 0 to π/2 is (1/√5)(π/2 - 0) = π/(2√5).

For the second integral: ∫ sin²φ/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ. Let me rewrite the integrand as [ (1 + 4 sin²φ) - 1 ] / [3(1 + 4 sin²φ) ] = [1/3 - 1/(3(1 + 4 sin²φ))]. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, express sin²φ = [1 - cos(2φ)]/2. Let me try that:

∫ sin²φ/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ = ∫ [ (1 - cos(2φ))/2 ] / [1 + 4*(1 - cos(2φ))/2 ] dφ = ∫ [ (1 - cos2φ)/2 ] / [1 + 2 - 2 cos2φ ] dφ = ∫ (1 - cos2φ)/(2*(3 - 2 cos2φ)) dφ.

Hmm, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, use substitution similar to the first integral. Let’s set u = tanφ again. Then sin²φ = u²/(1 + u²). So the integral becomes ∫ [ u²/(1 + u²) ] / [1 + 4u²/(1 + u²) ] * du/(1 + u²) = ∫ [ u²/(1 + u²) ] / [ (1 + u² + 4u²)/(1 + u²) ) ] * du/(1 + u²) = ∫ [ u² / (1 + 5u²) ] * du/(1 + u²).

So this becomes ∫ u² / [ (1 + 5u²)(1 + u²) ] du. Let me perform partial fractions. Let’s write u² / [(1 + 5u²)(1 + u²)] = A/(1 + 5u²) + B/(1 + u²). Multiply both sides by (1 + 5u²)(1 + u²):

u² = A(1 + u²) + B(1 + 5u²).

Set up equations by equating coefficients:

For u² terms: 1 = A + 5B.

For constant terms: 0 = A + B.

From the second equation: A = -B. Substitute into first equation: -B + 5B = 1 => 4B =1 => B=1/4, then A= -1/4.

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [ (-1/4)/(1 + 5u²) + (1/4)/(1 + u²) ] du = (-1/4)(1/√5) arctan(u√5) + (1/4) arctan(u) + C.

So the integral from 0 to infinity (since φ from 0 to π/2, u = tanφ goes to infinity) is:

[ (-1/(4√5)) arctan(u√5) + (1/4) arctan(u) ] from 0 to ∞.

At u → ∞: arctan(u√5) → π/2, arctan(u) → π/2. So the expression becomes (-1/(4√5))(π/2) + (1/4)(π/2) = π/8 (1 - 1/√5).

At u=0: both terms are 0. So the integral is π/8 (1 - 1/√5).

Therefore, the second integral ∫ sin²φ/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ from 0 to π/2 is π/8 (1 - 1/√5).

Putting it all together, the original second integral:

4 [ ∫ 1/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ - ∫ sin²φ/(1 + 4 sin²φ) dφ ] = 4 [ π/(2√5) - π/8 (1 - 1/√5) ].

Let me compute this:

First term: 4 * π/(2√5) = 2π/√5.

Second term: 4 * π/8 (1 - 1/√5) = (π/2)(1 - 1/√5).

So total: 2π/√5 - π/2 (1 - 1/√5) = 2π/√5 - π/2 + π/(2√5).

Combine terms:

2π/√5 + π/(2√5) = (4π/2√5 + π/(2√5)) = 5π/(2√5) = π√5/2.

Then subtract π/2: π√5/2 - π/2 = π/2)(√5 -1).

So the second integral ∫₀² sqrt(4 - t²)/(1 + t²) dt = π/2 (√5 -1).

Okay, that's the second part. Now the first part of the original integral is 2 ∫₀² [ln( (2 + sqrt(4 - t²))/t ) / (1 + t²) ] dt. Let me denote this as 2.

So I2 = 2 ∫₀² [ln(2 + sqrt(4 - t²)) - ln t ] / (1 + t²) dt.

Split into two integrals:

I2 = 2 [ ∫₀² ln(2 + sqrt(4 - t²)) / (1 + t²) dt - ∫₀² ln t / (1 + t²) dt ].

The second integral here, ∫₀² ln t / (1 + t²) dt. Let me compute that. Let me recall that ∫ ln t / (1 + t²) dt from 0 to ∞ is 0, but here it's from 0 to 2. Let me substitute u = 1/t. Let’s see:

Let u = 1/t, so when t approaches 0, u approaches infinity, and when t=2, u=1/2. Then dt = -1/u² du. The integral becomes ∫_{∞}^{1/2} ln(1/u) / (1 + (1/u)^2) * (-1/u²) du = ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (1 + 1/u²) * (1/u²) du = ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (u² + 1) du.

But this seems to relate to the original integral. Let me check:

Let’s denote J = ∫₀² ln t / (1 + t²) dt. Then using substitution u = 1/t, J = ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (1 + u²) du. So J = - ∫_{1/2}^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du. But the integral from 0 to ∞ of ln u / (1 + u²) du is 0, since it's an odd function around u=1. Wait, actually, the integral from 0 to ∞ is 0. So ∫₀^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du = 0. Therefore, J + ∫_{2}^∞ ln t / (1 + t²) dt = ∫₀^∞ ln t / (1 + t²) dt = 0. Wait, but substitution gives J = - ∫_{1/2}^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du. Let me check again.

Wait, original substitution: t = 1/u, so J = ∫₀² ln t / (1 + t²) dt = ∫_{∞}^{1/2} ln(1/u) / (1 + (1/u)^2) * (-1/u²) du = ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (1 + u²) * (1/u²) * u² du. Wait, no, let's do it step by step:

t = 1/u ⇒ dt = -1/u² du. When t=0, u=∞; t=2, u=1/2. So:

J = ∫_{u=∞}^{u=1/2} ln(1/u) / (1 + (1/u)^2) * (-1/u²) du

= ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (1 + 1/u²) * (1/u²) du

= ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / ( (u² + 1)/u² ) * (1/u²) du

= ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] * u² / (u² + 1) * (1/u²) du

= ∫_{1/2}^∞ [ -ln u ] / (u² + 1) du

= - ∫_{1/2}^∞ ln u / (u² + 1) du

But the integral from 0 to ∞ of ln u / (u² + 1) du is 0, as it's an odd function around u=1 (substitution u = 1/v). Therefore, ∫₀^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du = 0. Therefore, ∫₀^{1/2} ln u / (1 + u²) du + ∫_{1/2}^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du = 0. Therefore, ∫_{1/2}^∞ ln u / (1 + u²) du = - ∫₀^{1/2} ln u / (1 + u²) du. Therefore, J = - [ - ∫₀^{1/2} ln u / (1 + u²) du ] = ∫₀^{1/2} ln u / (1 + u²) du.

But this doesn't directly help. Alternatively, perhaps compute J directly. Let me consider substitution t = tanθ. Let t = tanθ, so dt = sec²θ dθ. When t=0, θ=0; t=2, θ=arctan(2). Then J becomes ∫₀^{arctan(2)} ln(tanθ) / (1 + tan²θ) * sec²θ dθ. Since 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, this simplifies to ∫₀^{arctan(2)} ln(tanθ) dθ.

Hmm, ln(tanθ) = ln(sinθ) - ln(cosθ). So the integral becomes ∫ [ln(sinθ) - ln(cosθ)] dθ from 0 to arctan(2). Let me split this into two integrals:

∫ ln(sinθ) dθ - ∫ ln(cosθ) dθ from 0 to arctan(2).

But these integrals are known to be related to the dilogarithm function, but maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me consider substitution in the second integral. Let φ = π/2 - θ. Then when θ=0, φ=π/2; θ=arctan(2), φ=π/2 - arctan(2). But this might not help. Alternatively, note that ∫ ln(cosθ) dθ from 0 to arctan(2) can be expressed in terms of the original variable. Alternatively, perhaps use series expansion.

Alternatively, recall that ∫ ln(tanθ) dθ from 0 to π/4 is -Catalan's constant, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe integrate by parts. Let me try integrating J = ∫₀² ln t / (1 + t²) dt. Let u = ln t, dv = dt/(1 + t²). Then du = (1/t) dt, v = arctan t. So integration by parts gives uv |₀² - ∫₀² arctan t * (1/t) dt.

But uv at 2 is ln(2) arctan(2), and at 0, ln(0) is -infty, but arctan(0) is 0, so the term is 0. So J = ln(2) arctan(2) - ∫₀² (arctan t)/t dt.

Hmm, the integral ∫ (arctan t)/t dt. Let me set w = arctan t, dw = 1/(1 + t²) dt. Let me make substitution z = t². Not sure. Alternatively, expand arctan t into its Taylor series.

Recall that arctan t = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n t^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |t| ≤1. But since our integral is up to t=2, which is outside the radius of convergence. Hmm, maybe use substitution. Let me set u = t^2. Then du = 2t dt. Not sure. Alternatively, integrate by parts again.

Let me set u = arctan t, dv = (1/t) dt. Then du = 1/(1 + t²) dt, v = ln t. So ∫ (arctan t)/t dt = arctan t ln t - ∫ ln t / (1 + t²) dt. But this brings us back to J. So we have:

J = ln(2) arctan(2) - [ arctan t ln t |₀² - J ].

So J = ln(2) arctan(2) - [ arctan(2) ln 2 - 0 - J ].

Therefore, J = ln(2) arctan(2) - arctan(2) ln 2 + J.

Wait, this implies J = J, which is a tautology. Hmm, this approach isn't helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, consider that ∫ (arctan t)/t dt is a known integral. Let me look it up in my mind. The integral of arctan t / t dt can be expressed in terms of the dilogarithm function. Specifically, ∫ arctan t / t dt = (1/2i) [ Li_2(it) - Li_2(-it) ] + C, where Li_2 is the dilogarithm function. But this might be too advanced. Alternatively, since we are dealing with definite integrals from 0 to 2, perhaps express it in terms of known constants or functions.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution x = t². Let me try x = t², dx = 2t dt. Then the integral becomes ∫ (arctan sqrt(x)) / sqrt(x) * dx/(2 sqrt(x)) ) = (1/2) ∫ arctan sqrt(x) / x dx. Let u = sqrt(x), so x = u², dx = 2u du. Then the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ arctan u / u² * 2u du = ∫ arctan u / u du. Which is the same as the original integral. So this doesn't help.

Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe we need to accept that this integral can't be expressed in elementary functions and proceed accordingly. However, the problem states to compute the integral analytically to obtain the exact answer, so there must be a way.

Wait, going back to the original problem. The integral is ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) arctan(x) dx. Let me consider another substitution. Let me set x = 2 sinθ, which we tried earlier. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} (2 cosθ / (2 sinθ)) * arctan(2 sinθ) * 2 cosθ dθ = ∫₀^{π/2} (2 cos²θ / sinθ) arctan(2 sinθ) dθ.

Let me denote φ = 2 sinθ. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, integrate by parts here. Let me set u = arctan(2 sinθ), dv = (2 cos²θ / sinθ) dθ. Then du = [ (2 cosθ) / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ. And v = ∫ (2 cos²θ / sinθ) dθ. Wait, we did this integral earlier. From previous steps, this integral is 2 [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ] + C. So v = 2 [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ].

So integration by parts gives uv |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v * [ (2 cosθ) / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ.

Evaluate uv at the limits:

At θ=π/2: sinθ=1, so arctan(2*1)=arctan(2). cscθ=1, cotθ=0, so v=2 [ -ln(1 + 0) + 0 ] = 0. So uv at π/2 is arctan(2)*0=0.

At θ=0: sinθ=0, so arctan(0)=0. The term v at θ=0: cscθ approaches infinity, cotθ approaches infinity, so ln(cscθ + cotθ) approaches ln(∞), which is infinity. But cosθ=1, so v=2 [ -ln(∞) +1 ] = -infty. But multiplied by u=0, so the product is 0* (-infty), which is indeterminate. Hmm, need to check the limit.

As θ approaches 0+, sinθ ~ θ, so cscθ ~ 1/θ, cotθ ~ 1/θ. So cscθ + cotθ ~ 2/θ. So ln(cscθ + cotθ) ~ ln(2/θ) = ln2 - lnθ. Then v ~ 2 [ -ln(2/θ) +1 ] = 2 [ -ln2 + lnθ +1 ]. Then u = arctan(2 sinθ) ~ arctan(2θ) ~ 2θ. So uv ~ 2θ * 2 [ -ln2 + lnθ +1 ] ~ 4θ [ -ln2 + lnθ +1 ]. As θ approaches 0, lnθ approaches -infty, but multiplied by θ which approaches 0. The limit is 0, since θ lnθ approaches 0. Therefore, uv at 0 is 0.

Therefore, the uv term is 0 - 0 = 0.

Now, the remaining term is - ∫₀^{π/2} v * [ (2 cosθ) / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ.

Substituting v = 2 [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ], the integral becomes:

-2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ] * [ 2 cosθ / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ.

Simplify:

-2 * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ] [ cosθ / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ

= -4 ∫₀^{π/2} [ -ln(cscθ + cotθ) + cosθ ] [ cosθ / (1 + 4 sin²θ) ] dθ.

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, going back to the original problem. Maybe consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me define a parameter a in the integral and differentiate with respect to a. Let’s see:

Let’s consider I(a) = ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) arctan(a x) dx. Then we need to find I(1).

Compute dI/da = ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) * x/(1 + a² x²) dx = ∫₀² sqrt(4 - x²)/(1 + a² x²) dx.

This is similar to the integral we computed earlier. Let me compute this integral.

Let’s set x = 2 sinθ, dx = 2 cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(4 - x²) = 2 cosθ. The integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [2 cosθ / (1 + a² 4 sin²θ) ] * 2 cosθ dθ = 4 ∫₀^{π/2} cos²θ / (1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ.

This is similar to the integral we did before. Let me use the same approach. Express cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ:

4 ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - sin²θ] / (1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ = 4 [ ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ - ∫₀^{π/2} sin²θ/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ ].

For the first integral, ∫ 1/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ. Use substitution t = tanθ, then sinθ = t²/(1 + t²), etc. Alternatively, use the standard integral ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + k sin²θ) dθ = π/(2 sqrt(1 + k))).

Yes, the standard result is ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + k sin²θ) dθ = π/(2 sqrt(1 + k))).

So for the first integral, k = 4 a², so the integral is π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²))).

For the second integral, ∫ sin²θ/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ. Let me write this as [1/(4 a²)] ∫ [4 a² sin²θ +1 -1 ] / (1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ = [1/(4 a²)] ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) ] dθ.

So the integral becomes [1/(4 a²)] [ ∫₀^{π/2} dθ - ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + 4 a² sin²θ) dθ ] = [1/(4 a²)] [ π/2 - π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) ) ].

Therefore, the second integral is [1/(4 a²)] [ π/2 - π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) ) ].

Putting it all together:

dI/da = 4 [ π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) - [1/(4 a²)] (π/2 - π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) ) ].

Simplify:

= 4 [ π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) - π/(8 a²) + π/(8 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) ) ]

= 4 * π/(2 sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) - 4 * π/(8 a²) + 4 * π/(8 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²))

= 2π / sqrt(1 + 4 a²) - π/(2 a²) + π/(2 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)).

Combine terms:

= 2π / sqrt(1 + 4 a²) + π/(2 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) - π/(2 a²).

Factor out π/(2 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)):

= π/(2 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) [ 4 a² +1 ] - π/(2 a²).

But 4 a² +1 is (1 + 4 a²), so:

= π/(2 a² sqrt(1 + 4 a²)) * (1 + 4 a²) - π/(2 a²)

= π/(2 a²) sqrt(1 + 4 a²) - π/(2 a²)

= π/(2 a²) [ sqrt(1 + 4 a²) -1 ].

Therefore, dI/da = π/(2 a²) [ sqrt(1 + 4 a²) -1 ].

Now, to find I(1), we need to integrate dI/da from a=0 to a=1. Since I(0) = ∫₀² (sqrt(4 - x²)/x) arctan(0) dx = 0, because arctan(0)=0. Therefore, I(1) = ∫₀¹ dI/da da = ∫₀¹ π/(2 a²) [ sqrt(1 + 4 a²) -1 ] da.

So I(1) = π/2 ∫₀¹ [ sqrt(1 + 4 a²) -1 ] / a² da.

Let me compute this integral. Let’s split it into two parts:

∫ [ sqrt(1 + 4 a²)/a² - 1/a² ] da = ∫ sqrt(1 + 4a²)/a² da - ∫ 1/a² da.

The second integral is straightforward: ∫ 1/a² da = -1/a + C.

For the first integral, ∫ sqrt(1 + 4a²)/a² da. Let me use substitution. Let u = sqrt(1 + 4a²), then du/dx = (4a)/sqrt(1 + 4a²). Let me rearrange:

Let’s set u = sqrt(1 + 4a²), then u² =1 +4a², so 2u du = 8a da ⇒ a da = (u du)/4.

But we have ∫ sqrt(1 +4a²)/a² da = ∫ u / a² da. Express a in terms of u: a² = (u² -1)/4. So a = sqrt( (u² -1)/4 ). Therefore, a² = (u² -1)/4.

But this might not help. Alternatively, use substitution t = 2a. Let t = 2a, so dt = 2 da, a = t/2, da = dt/2. Then the integral becomes ∫ sqrt(1 + t²)/( (t/2)² ) * dt/2 = ∫ sqrt(1 + t²) / (t²/4) * dt/2 = 4/2 ∫ sqrt(1 + t²)/t² dt = 2 ∫ sqrt(1 + t²)/t² dt.

Now, ∫ sqrt(1 + t²)/t² dt. Let me integrate by parts. Let u = sqrt(1 + t²), dv = dt/t². Then du = t/sqrt(1 + t²) dt, v = -1/t.

So integration by parts gives -sqrt(1 + t²)/t + ∫ (1/t) * t/sqrt(1 + t²) dt = -sqrt(1 + t²)/t + ∫ 1/sqrt(1 + t²) dt.

The integral ∫1/sqrt(1 + t²) dt = sinh^{-1}(t) + C = ln(t + sqrt(t² +1)) + C.

Therefore, the integral becomes -sqrt(1 + t²)/t + ln(t + sqrt(t² +1)) + C.

Substituting back t = 2a:

- sqrt(1 +4a²)/(2a) + ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) + C.

Therefore, the first integral ∫ sqrt(1 +4a²)/a² da = 2 [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/(2a) + ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] + C = - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) + C.

Therefore, the original integral I(1) = π/2 [ ∫₀¹ sqrt(1 +4a²)/a² da - ∫₀¹ 1/a² da ] = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ) |₀¹ - ( -1/a ) |₀¹ ].

Compute each part:

First part evaluated at 1:

- sqrt(1 +4(1))/1 + 2 ln(2*1 + sqrt(4 +1)) = -sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)).

At a approaching 0:

- sqrt(1 +0)/0 + 2 ln(0 +1). The first term is -1/0 which is -infty, but we need to consider the limit as a approaches 0+.

Let’s compute the limit as a→0+ of [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ].

sqrt(1 +4a²) ~ 1 + 2a². So sqrt(1 +4a²)/a ~ (1 + 2a²)/a ~ 1/a + 2a. So -sqrt(1 +4a²)/a ~ -1/a -2a.

For the logarithmic term: 2 ln(2a + sqrt(1 +4a²)) = 2 ln(2a +1 + 2a²) ~ 2 ln(1 +2a +2a²) ~ 2 [2a - 2a² + ... ] using Taylor series ln(1 +x) ~ x -x²/2 +x³/3 -...

But 2a +2a² is small as a→0, so ln(1 +2a +2a²) ~ 2a +2a² - ( (2a +2a²)^2 )/2 + ... ~ 2a +2a² - (4a² +8a³ +4a^4)/2 ~ 2a +2a² -2a² -4a³ +... ~ 2a -4a³ +...

So multiplying by 2: ~4a -8a³ +...

Therefore, the entire expression as a→0+:

-1/a -2a +4a -8a³ +... ~ -1/a +2a -8a³ +...

The term -1/a dominates, so the limit is -infty. However, we need to consider the combination with the second part of the integral.

The second part is - ( -1/a ) |₀¹ = - [ (-1/1) - (-1/0) ] = - [ -1 + ∞ ] which is problematic. Wait, this suggests that the integral might diverge, but we know that the original integral I(1) is convergent because the integrand behaves like (sqrt(4 -x²)/x) arctan(x) ~ (2/x) * x as x→0, so ~2, which is integrable. Therefore, there must be cancellation of the divergent terms.

Let me re-express the expression:

I(1) = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) - lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] - ( -1/1 + lim_{a→0+} 1/a ) ].

But this seems to involve canceling infinities. Let me carefully compute the limit:

Consider the expression:

[ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] + 1/a.

As a→0+, this becomes:

[ - (1 + 2a²)/a + 2 ln(2a +1 + 2a²) ] +1/a.

= [ -1/a -2a + 2 ln(1 +2a +2a²) ] +1/a.

= -2a + 2 ln(1 +2a +2a²).

Now expand ln(1 +2a +2a²) for small a:

ln(1 +2a +2a²) ≈ 2a +2a² - ( (2a +2a²)^2 )/2 + ( (2a +2a²)^3 )/3 -...

= 2a +2a² - (4a² +8a³ +4a^4)/2 + (8a³ + ...)/3

= 2a +2a² -2a² -4a³ + (8a³)/3 +...

= 2a -4a³ + (8a³)/3 +...

= 2a - (4 - 8/3)a³ +...

= 2a - (4/3)a³ +...

Multiply by 2:

2 ln(...) ≈4a - (8/3)a³ +...

So the expression becomes:

-2a +4a - (8/3)a³ +... = 2a - (8/3)a³ +...

Therefore, as a→0+, the expression [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] +1/a approaches 0.

Therefore, the limit as a→0+ of [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) +1/a ] is 0.

Therefore, the integral I(1) = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) - ( -1 ) ].

Wait, let me clarify:

The original expression for I(1) is π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) - lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] - ( -1 + lim_{a→0+} 1/a ) ].

But we saw that the combination [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) +1/a ] approaches 0 as a→0. Therefore, lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] = - lim_{a→0+} 1/a +0.

But this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the evaluation. Let me re-express the integral I(1):

I(1) = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5)/1 + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) - ( - sqrt(1 +0)/0 + 2 ln(0 +1) ) - ( -1/1 + 1/0 ) ].

But this is not correct. The correct expression after evaluating the antiderivatives is:

I(1) = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) - lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] - ( -1 + lim_{a→0+} 1/a ) ].

But the term lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) ] + lim_{a→0+} 1/a = lim_{a→0+} [ - sqrt(1 +4a²)/a + 2 ln(2a + sqrt(4a² +1)) +1/a ] = 0, as we saw earlier.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

I(1) = π/2 [ ( - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ) -0 - (-1) ] = π/2 [ - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5)) +1 ].

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is (π/2)(1 - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5))).

Simplify this expression:

= (π/2)(1 - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5))).

This is the analytical result.

Now, compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute each part:

First, compute sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2360679775.

2 + sqrt(5) ≈ 2 + 2.2360679775 ≈ 4.2360679775.

ln(4.2360679775) ≈ 1.443635475178.

Multiply by 2: 2.887270950356.

Then 1 - sqrt(5) ≈ 1 - 2.2360679775 ≈ -1.2360679775.

Add to 2.887270950356: -1.2360679775 + 2.887270950356 ≈ 1.651202972856.

Multiply by π/2: 1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966.

Compute this:

1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈

First, 1 * 1.5708 ≈ 1.5708

0.6 * 1.5708 ≈ 0.9425

0.05 * 1.5708 ≈ 0.0785

0.0012 * 1.5708 ≈ 0.001885

Adding up: 1.5708 +0.9425=2.5133 +0.0785=2.5918 +0.001885≈2.5937.

But this is a rough estimate. Let me use a calculator:

1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966:

1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈

Let me compute 1.6512 * 1.5708:

1.6512 * 1.5708 = ?

1 * 1.5708 = 1.5708

0.6 * 1.5708 = 0.94248

0.05 * 1.5708 = 0.07854

0.0012 * 1.5708 = 0.00188496

Adding these: 1.5708 + 0.94248 = 2.51328 + 0.07854 = 2.59182 + 0.00188496 ≈ 2.59370496.

But more accurately, using a calculator:

1.651202972856 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈ 2.5937033056.

So the exact value is (π/2)(1 - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5))) ≈ 2.5937033056.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 2.5937033056.

But let me verify this with a more precise calculation:

Compute each term:

sqrt(5) ≈ 2.23606797749979

2 + sqrt(5) ≈ 4.23606797749979

ln(4.23606797749979) ≈ 1.443635475178006

Multiply by 2: 2.887270950356012

1 - sqrt(5) ≈ 1 - 2.23606797749979 ≈ -1.23606797749979

Add to 2.887270950356012: -1.23606797749979 + 2.887270950356012 ≈ 1.651202972856222

Multiply by π/2: 1.651202972856222 * 1.5707963267948966 ≈

1.651202972856222 * 1.5707963267948966:

Let me compute this using more precise steps:

1.651202972856222 * 1.5707963267948966

= 1.651202972856222 * (π/2)

Using calculator: π/2 ≈ 1.5707963267948966

Multiply 1.651202972856222 * 1.5707963267948966:

= 1.651202972856222 * 1.5707963267948966

≈ 2.593703305555...

So approximately 2.5937033056.

Therefore, the numerical approximation is approximately 2.5937033056, which rounds to 2.5937033056 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

But let me check with a numerical integration to confirm. Let's approximate the original integral numerically.

The integral is ∫₀² (sqrt(4 -x²)/x) arctan(x) dx.

At x near 0, the integrand behaves like (2/x) * x = 2, so it's finite. The integral should converge.

Using numerical approximation methods, let's estimate the integral.

But since I don't have a calculator here, but based on the analytical result, we have the exact answer as (π/2)(1 - sqrt(5) + 2 ln(2 + sqrt(5))).

Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 2.5937033056.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact: (π/2)(1 - √5 + 2 ln(2 + √5))

Numerical: approximately 2.5937033056.
