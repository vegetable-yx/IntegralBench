Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of cos(x)cos(3x)cos(5x) from 0 to π. Hmm, integrating a product of three cosine functions. That seems a bit tricky. I remember that when dealing with products of trigonometric functions, using product-to-sum identities can simplify the integral. Let me recall those identities.

First, maybe I can simplify cos(x)cos(3x) first, and then multiply by cos(5x). The product-to-sum formula for two cosines is: cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2. Let me apply that to cos(x)cos(3x).

So, cos(x)cos(3x) = [cos(4x) + cos(-2x)] / 2. But cos is even, so cos(-2x) = cos(2x). Therefore, that simplifies to [cos(4x) + cos(2x)] / 2.

Now, the original integral becomes the integral from 0 to π of [cos(4x) + cos(2x)] / 2 * cos(5x) dx. Let me factor out the 1/2, so it's (1/2) ∫ [cos(4x)cos(5x) + cos(2x)cos(5x)] dx.

Now, I need to handle each term separately. Let's take the first term: cos(4x)cos(5x). Again, apply the product-to-sum formula. So cos(4x)cos(5x) = [cos(9x) + cos(-x)] / 2 = [cos(9x) + cos(x)] / 2. Similarly, the second term: cos(2x)cos(5x) = [cos(7x) + cos(-3x)] / 2 = [cos(7x) + cos(3x)] / 2.

So substituting back into the integral, we have:

(1/2) * [ ( [cos(9x) + cos(x)] / 2 ) + ( [cos(7x) + cos(3x)] / 2 ) ] dx

Combine the terms inside:

(1/2) * [ (cos(9x) + cos(x) + cos(7x) + cos(3x)) / 2 ] dx

Which simplifies to (1/4) ∫ [cos(9x) + cos(x) + cos(7x) + cos(3x)] dx.

So the integral is (1/4) times the sum of each cosine term integrated from 0 to π. Let's break it down term by term.

First, integrate cos(9x) from 0 to π. The integral of cos(ax) is (1/a) sin(ax). So:

∫ cos(9x) dx from 0 to π = [ (1/9) sin(9x) ] from 0 to π = (1/9)(sin(9π) - sin(0)) = (1/9)(0 - 0) = 0.

Similarly, ∫ cos(7x) dx from 0 to π = [ (1/7) sin(7x) ] from 0 to π = (1/7)(sin(7π) - sin(0)) = 0.

Same with ∫ cos(3x) dx from 0 to π: [ (1/3) sin(3x) ] from 0 to π = (1/3)(0 - 0) = 0.

And ∫ cos(x) dx from 0 to π: [ sin(x) ] from 0 to π = sin(π) - sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0.

Wait, but that would mean all the integrals are zero? So the entire integral is (1/4)(0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0. But that possible?

Hmm, let me check my steps again. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the product-to-sum formulas.

Starting over, let's verify the first step. cos(x)cos(3x) becomes [cos(4x) + cos(2x)] / 2. That's correct. Then multiplying by cos(5x) gives [cos(4x)cos(5x) + cos(2x)cos(5x)] / 2. Then applying product-to-sum again:

cos(4x)cos(5x) = [cos(9x) + cos(-x)] / 2 = [cos(9x) + cos(x)] / 2. Correct.

cos(2x)cos(5x) = [cos(7x) + cos(-3x)] / 2 = [cos(7x) + cos(3x)] / 2. Correct.

So the integral becomes (1/4) times the sum of cos(9x) + cos(x) + cos(7x) + cos(3x). Then integrating each term over 0 to π. Since all the sine terms evaluated at π and 0 are zero, because sin(nπ) is zero for integer n, and sin(0) is zero. Therefore, each integral is zero. Therefore, the entire integral is zero. So the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.

But wait, let me check with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically to see if it's indeed zero. Let's pick a sample point. For example, at x=0, the integrand is cos(0)cos(0)cos(0) = 1*1*1=1. At x=π/2, cos(π/2)=0, so the integrand is 0. At x=π, cos(π) = -1, cos(3π)= -1, cos(5π)= -1, so the product is (-1)^3 = -1. But integrating from 0 to π, the function might be symmetric in such a way that the positive and negative areas cancel out. Wait, but the integral of an odd function over symmetric limits would be zero, but here the limits are from 0 to π, which isn't symmetric around the origin. However, maybe the function has some periodicity or symmetry that causes the integral to be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the process. Let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach the problem. For example, using orthogonality of cosine functions over the interval [0, π]. The integral of cos(nx)cos(mx) over [0, π] is zero unless n=m, in which case it's π/2. But here we have three cosines multiplied together. Hmm, but orthogonality applies to the product of two cosines. For three, maybe we can use some other identity.

Alternatively, perhaps using complex exponentials. Let me try that. Express each cosine as (e^{ix} + e^{-ix}) / 2. So:

cos(x)cos(3x)cos(5x) = [ (e^{ix} + e^{-ix})/2 ] [ (e^{i3x} + e^{-i3x})/2 ] [ (e^{i5x} + e^{-i5x})/2 ]

Multiplying these out would give a sum of terms like e^{i(x + 3x +5x)} = e^{i9x}, e^{i(x +3x -5x)} = e^{-ix}, etc. Let's compute all possible combinations:

The product is (1/8)[ e^{i(x+3x+5x)} + e^{i(x+3x-5x)} + e^{i(x-3x+5x)} + e^{i(-x+3x+5x)} + e^{i(x-3x-5x)} + e^{i(-x+3x-5x)} + e^{i(-x-3x+5x)} + e^{i(-x-3x-5x)} ]

Simplify the exponents:

1. e^{i9x}
2. e^{i(-x)} (since x+3x-5x = -x)
3. e^{i3x} (x-3x+5x=3x)
4. e^{i7x} (-x+3x+5x=7x)
5. e^{i(-7x)} (x-3x-5x=-7x)
6. e^{i(-3x)} (-x+3x-5x=-3x)
7. e^{i(x)} (-x-3x+5x=x)
8. e^{i(-9x)} (-x-3x-5x=-9x)

So combining these terms:

(1/8)[ e^{i9x} + e^{-ix} + e^{i3x} + e^{i7x} + e^{-i7x} + e^{-i3x} + e^{ix} + e^{-i9x} ]

Grouping complex exponentials:

= (1/8)[ (e^{i9x} + e^{-i9x}) + (e^{i7x} + e^{-i7x}) + (e^{i3x} + e^{-i3x}) + (e^{ix} + e^{-ix}) ]

Which is:

= (1/8)[ 2cos(9x) + 2cos(7x) + 2cos(3x) + 2cos(x) ]

= (1/4)[ cos(9x) + cos(7x) + cos(3x) + cos(x) ]

So the integrand is (1/4)(cos(9x) + cos(7x) + cos(3x) + cos(x)). Therefore, integrating from 0 to π:

Integral = (1/4) [ ∫cos(9x)dx + ∫cos(7x)dx + ∫cos(3x)dx + ∫cos(x)dx ] from 0 to π.

Each integral of cos(nx) from 0 to π is [sin(nπ) - sin(0)] / n = (0 - 0)/n = 0. Therefore, the entire integral is (1/4)(0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0. So the exact answer is 0. Numerically, that's 0.0000000000.

Therefore, the answer is zero. Let me just verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically. For example, using Simpson's rule or a calculator. But since the analytical result is zero, the numerical approximation should be very close to zero, considering possible rounding errors. But given that all terms integrate to zero exactly, the numerical value is exactly zero. So the answer is zero.
