Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of cos(20x) times sin(25x) from -π/2 to π/2. Hmm, integrals like this often involve trigonometric identities to simplify the product of sine and cosine. I remember there's a product-to-sum formula that might help here. Let me recall that.

The product-to-sum identity for sine and cosine is: cos(A)sin(B) = [sin(A+B) + sin(B-A)] / 2. Let me check that. Yeah, right. So if I apply this identity to cos(20x)sin(25x), then A is 20x and B is 25x. Plugging into the formula, that would give [sin(20x + 25x) + sin(25x - 20x)] / 2. Simplifying the arguments, that's [sin(45x) + sin(5x)] / 2. So the integral becomes the integral from -π/2 to π/2 of [sin(45x) + sin(5x)] / 2 dx. I can split that into two separate integrals: (1/2)[∫sin(45x) dx + ∫sin(5x) dx] over the interval.

Now, integrating sin(kx) with respect to x is straightforward. The integral of sin(kx) dx is (-1/k)cos(kx) + C. So applying that to each term:

First term: ∫sin(45x) dx from -π/2 to π/2 is [-1/45 cos(45x)] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2.

Second term: ∫sin(5x) dx from -π/2 to π/2 is [-1/5 cos(5x)] evaluated from the same limits.

So putting it all together, the integral is (1/2)[ (-1/45)(cos(45*(π/2)) - cos(45*(-π/2))) + (-1/5)(cos(5*(π/2)) - cos(5*(-π/2))) ].

Let me compute each part step by step. Let's handle the first part with 45x. Let's compute cos(45*(π/2)) and cos(-45*(π/2)). Since cosine is even, cos(-θ) = cosθ, so cos(-45π/2) = cos(45π/2). Therefore, the difference cos(45π/2) - cos(45π/2) would be zero? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the integral of sin(45x) from -a to a would be [-1/45 (cos(45a) - cos(-45a))] = [-1/45 (cos(45a) - cos(45a))] = 0. Because cos is even, so cos(-45a) = cos(45a). Therefore, the first integral term is zero. So the entire first part cancels out. So the first integral contributes nothing. Interesting.

Then the second integral is the same process. Let's compute the sin(5x) integral. The integral is [-1/5 (cos(5*(π/2)) - cos(5*(-π/2)))]. Again, cos(-5π/2) = cos(5π/2), so the difference becomes cos(5π/2) - cos(5π/2) = 0. Wait, that would also be zero? But that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, the integral of sin(5x) from -a to a would be zero as well? Because sin is an odd function, but when you integrate over symmetric limits, the integral of an odd function is zero. Wait, but here we have the integral of sin(5x), which is an odd function. So integrating an odd function over symmetric limits around zero would indeed give zero. So both integrals are zero? Then the entire integral would be zero?

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Wait, the original integrand is cos(20x) sin(25x). Let me check if this function is even or odd. Let's see, cos(20x) is even, because cosine is even. sin(25x) is odd. The product of an even function and an odd function is odd. Because even times odd is odd. So the integrand is an odd function. Therefore, integrating an odd function from -a to a gives zero. So the integral should be zero. Therefore, the exact answer is zero, and the numerical approximation is also zero. But let me confirm this through the steps.

Wait, but when I applied the product-to-sum formula, I split it into sin(45x) and sin(5x). Both of these are odd functions. So integrating sin(45x) from -a to a is zero, same with sin(5x). So the entire integral is zero. So the answer is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and numerically it's 0.0000000000.

But let me check with specific values. Let's compute cos(20x) sin(25x) at x = π/2. Let's compute cos(20*(π/2)) = cos(10π) = cos(0) = 1. Wait, cos(10π) is 1, since 10π is a multiple of 2π. Similarly, sin(25*(π/2)) = sin(25π/2). 25π/2 is 12π + π/2, so sin(12π + π/2) = sin(π/2) = 1. So at x=π/2, the integrand is 1*1=1. At x=-π/2, cos(20*(-π/2)) = cos(-10π) = 1, and sin(25*(-π/2)) = sin(-25π/2) = -sin(25π/2) = -1. So the integrand at x=-π/2 is 1*(-1) = -1. But since the function is odd, for every x, f(-x) = -f(x). So integrating from -a to a would cancel out. So the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is indeed zero. So the exact answer is 0, and the numerical is 0.0000000000.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the product-to-sum step. Let me rederive the identity. The product-to-sum formula: sin(A) cos(B) = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2. Wait, but in the original problem, it's cos(20x) sin(25x). So that's sin(25x) cos(20x). So according to the formula, that's [sin(25x + 20x) + sin(25x - 20x)] / 2 = [sin(45x) + sin(5x)] / 2. So that's correct. Then integrating sin(45x) and sin(5x) over symmetric limits. Both are odd functions, so their integrals over -a to a are zero. Therefore, the entire integral is zero. So the answer is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical is 0.0000000000. So the final answer should be {"answer": "0", "numerical_answer": "0.0000000000"}.
