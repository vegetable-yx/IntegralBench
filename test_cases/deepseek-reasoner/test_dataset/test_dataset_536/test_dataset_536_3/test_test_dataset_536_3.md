Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of cos(20x) times sin(25x) from -π/2 to π/2. Hmm, integrals like this often involve trigonometric identities to simplify the product of sine and cosine. I remember there's a product-to-sum formula that might help here. Let me recall that.

The product-to-sum identity for sine and cosine is something like sin(a)cos(b) equals [sin(a + b) + sin(a - b)] divided by 2. Let me check that. Yeah, I think that's right. So, applying that identity here, where a is 25x and b is 20x. Wait, no, actually, in the integral, it's cos(20x) times sin(25x). So maybe I should write it as sin(25x)cos(20x), which would fit the identity sin(a)cos(b) = [sin(a + b) + sin(a - b)] / 2. So here, a is 25x and b is 20x. So substituting that in, the integrand becomes [sin(25x + 20x) + sin(25x - 20x)] / 2. Simplifying the arguments inside the sine functions: 25x + 20x is 45x, and 25x - 20x is 5x. So the integral becomes the integral from -π/2 to π/2 of [sin(45x) + sin(5x)] / 2 dx.

Now, I can split the integral into two parts: (1/2) times the integral of sin(45x) dx plus (1/2) times the integral of sin(5x) dx, both from -π/2 to π/2. Let me write that as (1/2)[∫sin(45x) dx + ∫sin(5x) dx]. Now, integrating sin(ax) with respect to x gives -cos(ax)/a. So for the first integral, integrating sin(45x) would be -cos(45x)/(45), and similarly for the second integral, integrating sin(5x) would be -cos(5x)/5. So putting that together, the antiderivative is (1/2)[ (-cos(45x)/45) - (cos(5x)/5) ] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2.

Now, I need to compute this at the upper limit π/2 and subtract the value at the lower limit -π/2. Let's compute each term separately. Let's first handle the cos(45x) term. At x = π/2: cos(45*(π/2)) = cos(45π/2). Similarly, at x = -π/2: cos(45*(-π/2)) = cos(-45π/2). But cosine is even, so cos(-θ) = cosθ, so that's cos(45π/2). Similarly for the cos(5x) term: at x = π/2, cos(5*(π/2)) = cos(5π/2), and at x = -π/2, cos(-5π/2) = cos(5π/2).

So let's compute these cosine terms. Let's start with cos(45π/2). Since cosine has a period of 2π, we can reduce the angle modulo 2π. Let's compute 45π/2 divided by 2π. 45π/2 divided by 2π is 45/4, which is 11.25. So 11 full periods and 0.25 of a period. The 0.25 of 2π is π/2. So cos(45π/2) = cos(11*2π + π/2) = cos(π/2) because cosine is periodic with period 2π. Cos(π/2) is 0. Similarly, cos(5π/2) can be reduced. 5π/2 divided by 2π is 5/4, which is 1.25. So that's 1 full period (2π) plus π/2. So cos(5π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0. Wait, but wait, cos(5π/2) is actually cos(2π + π/2) which is cos(π/2) = 0. So both cos(45π/2) and cos(5π/2) are zero. But wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 45π/2: Let's compute 45π/2 divided by 2π. 45/2 divided by 2 is 45/4, which is 11.25. So 11 full periods (which can be ignored) and 0.25*2π = π/2. So yes, cos(45π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0. Similarly, 5π/2 is 2π + π/2, so cos(5π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0. So when we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit π/2, both terms become zero. Similarly, at the lower limit -π/2, we have cos(45*(-π/2)) = cos(-45π/2) = cos(45π/2) = 0, and cos(-5π/2) = cos(5π/2) = 0. So both terms at the lower limit are also zero. Therefore, the entire expression would be (1/2)[ (0/45 - 0/5 ) - (0/45 - 0/5) ] = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me re-express the antiderivative. The antiderivative is (1/2)[ (-cos(45x)/45) - (cos(5x)/5) ] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2. So when we plug in the upper limit, we get (1/2)[ (-cos(45*(π/2))/45 - cos(5*(π/2))/5 ) ] and subtract the lower limit, which is (1/2)[ (-cos(45*(-π/2))/45 - cos(5*(-π/2))/5 ) ].

But cos(45*(-π/2)) is cos(-45π/2) = cos(45π/2) as cosine is even. Similarly, cos(5*(-π/2)) = cos(-5π/2) = cos(5π/2). So the expression becomes (1/2)[ ( -cos(45π/2)/45 - cos(5π/2)/5 ) - ( -cos(45π/2)/45 - cos(5π/2)/5 ) ].

Wait, that's (upper limit) minus (lower limit). Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute F(π/2) = (-cos(45π/2)/45) - (cos(5π/2)/5). Then compute F(-π/2) = (-cos(-45π/2)/45) - (cos(-5π/2)/5) = (-cos(45π/2)/45) - (cos(5π/2)/5), since cosine is even. Therefore, F(π/2) - F(-π/2) = [ (-cos(45π/2)/45 - cos(5π/2)/5 ) ] - [ (-cos(45π/2)/45 - cos(5π/2)/5 ) ] = 0. Wait, that would imply the integral is zero. But that seems odd. Wait, but maybe that's correct. Let me check again.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the cosine terms. Let me re-examine cos(45π/2). Let's compute 45π/2. Let's divide 45 by 4, since 2π is a full circle, so 45π/2 divided by 2π is (45/2)/2 = 45/4 = 11.25. So 11 full circles (which contribute 22π) and 0.25 of a circle, which is π/2. So cos(45π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0. Similarly, cos(5π/2) is 5π/2 divided by 2π is 5/4, so 1 full circle (2π) and π/2. So cos(5π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0. Therefore, both terms in F(π/2) and F(-π/2) are zero, so their difference is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. But wait, is that possible?

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the integrand is an odd function. Let's see. The original integrand is cos(20x) sin(25x). Let's check if this function is even or odd. Remember that an even function times an odd function is odd. Cos(20x) is even because cos(-20x) = cos(20x). Sin(25x) is odd because sin(-25x) = -sin(25x). So the product of an even function and an odd function is odd. Therefore, the integrand is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around zero, like from -a to a, is zero. Therefore, the integral should indeed be zero. So that confirms the result. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is also 0.0000000000.

But wait, let me check with specific values. Let's take x = 0. The integrand at x=0 is cos(0) sin(0) = 1*0=0. At x=π/4, cos(20*(π/4))=cos(5π)= -1, sin(25*(π/4))=sin(25π/4)= sin(6π + π/4)= sin(π/4)=√2/2. So the product is -√2/2. At x=-π/4, cos(20*(-π/4))=cos(-5π)=cos(5π)= -1, sin(25*(-π/4))=sin(-25π/4)= -sin(25π/4)= -√2/2. So the product is (-1)*(-√2/2)=√2/2. So the function is odd, as expected. Therefore, integrating from -a to a would give zero. So yes, the integral is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.
