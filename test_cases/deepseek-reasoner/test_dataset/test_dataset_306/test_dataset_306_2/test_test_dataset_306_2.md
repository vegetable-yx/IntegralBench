Okay, let's tackle this integral. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1/2) times the natural logarithm of [1.0*sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + (1.0)^2 x(2 - x))] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe there's a substitution or symmetry that can simplify things.

First, let me rewrite the integrand to make it clearer. The integrand is x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} ln( sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(2 - x)) ). Wait, the 1.0 is just 1, so maybe that's redundant. So the argument of the log is sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(2 - x)). 

Hmm, the term inside the logarithm looks like sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(2 - x))) or something similar. Because sinh^{-1}(y) = ln(y + sqrt(y^2 + 1)). Let me check: if y = sqrt(x(2 - x)), then sinh^{-1}(y) = ln(y + sqrt(y^2 + 1)) = ln(sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(2 - x))). Oh! That's exactly the argument of the logarithm here. So the integrand simplifies to x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(2 - x))).

So the integral becomes ∫₀² [x(2 - x)]^{-1/2} sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. That seems more manageable. Now, maybe a substitution would help here. Let's consider substituting t = sqrt(x(2 - x)). But before that, let's note that the term [x(2 - x)]^{-1/2} is the same as 1/sqrt(x(2 - x)), which is the derivative of something? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps a trigonometric substitution. Let me try to make a substitution that simplifies x(2 - x). Let’s set x = 2 sin²θ. Then 2 - x = 2 cos²θ, so x(2 - x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ = (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 = sin²(2θ). Therefore, sqrt(x(2 - x)) = 2 sinθ cosθ = sin(2θ). Let's try this substitution.

Let x = 2 sin²θ. Then dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. The limits: when x=0, sinθ=0 ⇒ θ=0. When x=2, sin²θ=1 ⇒ θ=π/2. Let's substitute into the integral.

First, the integrand becomes [x(2 - x)]^{-1/2} = [4 sin²θ cos²θ]^{-1/2} = 1/(2 sinθ cosθ). Then, sinh^{-1}(sqrt(x(2 - x))) = sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)). So the integrand is (1/(2 sinθ cosθ)) * sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) * dx. But dx is 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. So putting it all together:

Integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [1/(2 sinθ cosθ)] * sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. The 1/(2 sinθ cosθ) and 4 sinθ cosθ multiply to 2. So the integral simplifies to 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) dθ.

Hmm, that's 2 times the integral of sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) from 0 to π/2. Let's see if we can simplify sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)). Remember that sinh^{-1}(y) = ln(y + sqrt(y² + 1)). So sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) = ln(sin(2θ) + sqrt(sin²(2θ) + 1)). But sin²(2θ) + 1 = 1 + sin²(2θ). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Wait, but sin(2θ) is between 0 and 1 for θ in [0, π/4], and between 1 and 0 again for θ in [π/4, π/2]. Wait, actually, when θ is from 0 to π/2, 2θ goes from 0 to π, so sin(2θ) goes from 0 up to 1 at θ=π/4 and back to 0 at θ=π/2. So sin(2θ) is symmetric around θ=π/4.

But maybe there's a way to express sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) in terms of θ. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me set φ = 2θ. Then when θ goes from 0 to π/2, φ goes from 0 to π. Then dθ = dφ/2. So the integral becomes 2 * ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) * (dφ/2) = ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ.

So now the integral is ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Hmm, integrating sinh^{-1}(sinφ) over 0 to π. Let's exploit symmetry. The function sinh^{-1}(sinφ) is symmetric around φ=π/2. Because sin(π - φ) = sinφ, so sinh^{-1}(sin(π - φ)) = sinh^{-1}(sinφ). Therefore, the integral from 0 to π is twice the integral from 0 to π/2. So ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Wait, but we already have ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.

Wait, maybe integrating from 0 to π, but sinh^{-1}(sinφ) is symmetric in a way that could be split. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let me try integrating ∫ sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Let u = sinh^{-1}(sinφ), dv = dφ. Then du = [1 / sqrt(sin²φ + 1)] * cosφ dφ, and v = φ. So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = φ sinh^{-1}(sinφ) - ∫ φ * [cosφ / sqrt(sin²φ + 1)] dφ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. The new term might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me set t = sinφ. Then when φ goes from 0 to π, t goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0. But maybe split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Let's try that.

First, ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ + ∫_{π/2}^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. In the second integral, let φ' = π - φ. Then when φ = π/2, φ' = π/2, and when φ = π, φ' = 0. So the second integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sin(π - φ')) (-dφ') = ∫_{0}^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ') dφ'. So both integrals are equal, so the total is 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. So back to the original substitution, the integral is 2 times that. Wait, but we had earlier that the original integral becomes ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ, which is 2 times ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. So maybe we can focus on integrating from 0 to π/2.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me consider that sinh^{-1}(sinφ) can be expressed in terms of logarithms. Let's write sinh^{-1}(sinφ) = ln(sinφ + sqrt(sin²φ + 1)). But sqrt(sin²φ + 1) = sqrt(1 + sin²φ). Hmm, not sure. Wait, but 1 + sin²φ is not a standard identity. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of hyperbolic functions. Wait, sinh^{-1}(y) = ln(y + sqrt(y² + 1)), so in this case, sinh^{-1}(sinφ) = ln(sinφ + sqrt(sin²φ + 1)). Hmm, but how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps consider a substitution t = φ. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of another approach. Let's recall that the original integral after substitution became ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Maybe there's a known integral for this. Alternatively, perhaps expand sinh^{-1}(sinφ) in a Fourier series or some series expansion. Let me try expanding sinh^{-1}(y) as a power series. The Taylor series for sinh^{-1}(y) around y=0 is y - (1/6)y³ + (3/40)y^5 - ... but here y = sinφ, which is not small over the entire interval. So maybe that's helpful only for part of the integral. Alternatively, perhaps integrating term by term, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, let's consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(a sinφ) dφ. Then, perhaps find I(1). Then, compute I'(a) = ∫₀^π [d/da sinh^{-1}(a sinφ)] dφ = ∫₀^π [sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)] dφ. Then, integrating I'(a) from a=0 to a=1. But I(0) = ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(0) dφ = ∫₀^π 0 dφ = 0. So I(1) = ∫₀^1 I'(a) da. So, I(1) = ∫₀^1 [ ∫₀^π sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ) dφ ] da. Maybe switch the order of integration: I(1) = ∫₀^π [ ∫₀^1 sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ) da ] dφ. Compute the inner integral with respect to a.

Let’s compute ∫₀^1 [sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)] da. Let’s substitute u = a sinφ, then da = du / sinφ. The limits when a=0, u=0; a=1, u=sinφ. So the inner integral becomes ∫₀^{sinφ} [sinφ / sqrt(1 + u²)] * (du / sinφ) = ∫₀^{sinφ} 1 / sqrt(1 + u²) du = sinh^{-1}(u) from 0 to sinφ = sinh^{-1}(sinφ) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(sinφ). Wait, but that brings us back to the original integral. Hmm, that seems circular. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me consider that sinh^{-1}(sinφ) = ln(sinφ + sqrt(1 + sin²φ)). Let me set t = tan(φ/2). Wait, maybe a substitution using t = tanφ. Let me think. Alternatively, let's consider that sqrt(1 + sin²φ) can be expressed in terms of cosh or something. Wait, 1 + sin²φ = cos²φ + 2 sin²φ. Not sure. Alternatively, use substitution u = tanφ. Let’s try that.

Let u = tanφ, so φ = arctan u, dφ = du/(1 + u²). When φ goes from 0 to π/2, u goes from 0 to ∞. But integrating up to π, maybe split the integral again. Hmm, this might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me recall that the original integral after substitution became ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Let me check if this integral is known or can be related to some standard integrals. Alternatively, perhaps use integration by parts again. Let’s try integrating by parts with u = sinh^{-1}(sinφ) and dv = dφ. Then du = [cosφ / sqrt(sin²φ + 1)] dφ, and v = φ. So the integral becomes φ sinh^{-1}(sinφ) |₀^π - ∫₀^π φ * [cosφ / sqrt(sin²φ + 1)] dφ. Evaluating the boundary terms: at φ=π, sinh^{-1}(sinπ) = sinh^{-1}(0) = 0, and φ=0, similarly 0=0. So the boundary term is zero. So the integral reduces to - ∫₀^π [φ cosφ / sqrt(sin²φ + 1)] dφ. Hmm, this seems more complicated. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps consider substitution in the remaining integral. Let’s set t = sinφ. Then dt = cosφ dφ. But sqrt(sin²φ + 1) = sqrt(t² + 1). So the integral becomes - ∫₀^0 [φ t / sqrt(t² + 1)] (dt / cosφ). Wait, but when t = sinφ, cosφ = sqrt(1 - t²). So this substitution might not be straightforward. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that the integrand is even or has some symmetry. Wait, but φ ranges from 0 to π. Alternatively, split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Let’s try that.

Let’s split the integral into I = ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ + ∫_{π/2}^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. For the second integral, let’s substitute φ = π - x. Then when φ = π/2, x = π/2, and when φ = π, x = 0. The integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sin(π - x)) (-dx) = ∫_{0}^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinx) dx. So the total integral I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. So now, focus on integrating from 0 to π/2.

Let’s make a substitution here. Let’s set t = φ. Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, set t = sinφ. Wait, maybe set t = sinh^{-1}(sinφ). Then, but that might not help. Alternatively, express sinh^{-1}(sinφ) in terms of logarithms. So sinh^{-1}(sinφ) = ln(sinφ + sqrt(1 + sin²φ)). So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sinφ + sqrt(1 + sin²φ)) dφ. Hmm, maybe this can be related to some known integral involving logarithms and trigonometric functions.

Alternatively, consider differentiating with respect to a parameter. Let’s define J(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(a sinφ + sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)) dφ. Then, our integral is 2 J(1). Compute J(1). Let’s find J(a)/da. Then, J(a)/da = ∫₀^{π/2} [sinφ + (a sin²φ)/sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)] / [a sinφ + sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)] dφ. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe simplify the derivative.

Wait, let me compute the derivative properly. Let’s denote y = a sinφ. Then, d/da [ln(y + sqrt(1 + y²))] = [ (sinφ + ( (2a sin²φ)/(2 sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)) )) ] / (y + sqrt(1 + y²)). Wait, actually, derivative of ln(y + sqrt(1 + y²)) with respect to a is [ (dy/da) + ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 + y²))) * 2y dy/da ) ] / (y + sqrt(1 + y²)) ). Simplify:

= [ dy/da (1 + y / sqrt(1 + y²)) ] / (y + sqrt(1 + y²)).

But dy/da = sinφ. So,

= [ sinφ (1 + y / sqrt(1 + y²)) ] / (y + sqrt(1 + y²)).

Let’s factor out sqrt(1 + y²) in the denominator:

= [ sinφ ( sqrt(1 + y²) + y ) / sqrt(1 + y²) ) ] / (y + sqrt(1 + y²)).

The numerator and denominator have (sqrt(1 + y²) + y), so they cancel. Thus, the derivative simplifies to sinφ / sqrt(1 + y²) = sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ).

Therefore, J’(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} [ sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ) ] dφ.

Now, we need to compute J’(a). Let’s make a substitution. Let’s set t = cosφ. Then, dt = -sinφ dφ. When φ=0, t=1; φ=π/2, t=0. So the integral becomes:

J’(a) = ∫₁^0 [ -dt / sqrt(1 + a² (1 - t²)) ] = ∫₀^1 [1 / sqrt(1 + a² (1 - t²)) ] dt.

Simplify the integrand:

sqrt(1 + a² - a² t²) = sqrt( (1 + a²) - a² t² ). So,

J’(a) = ∫₀^1 1 / sqrt( (1 + a²) - a² t² ) dt.

This is a standard integral. The integral of 1/sqrt(c - d t²) dt is (1/√d) arcsin(t sqrt(d/c)) ) + C, provided c and d are positive. Here, c = 1 + a², d = a². So,

J’(a) = [1 / a] arcsin( t a / sqrt(1 + a²) ) ) evaluated from 0 to 1.

At t=1: arcsin( a / sqrt(1 + a²) ). At t=0: 0. So,

J’(a) = (1/a) arcsin( a / sqrt(1 + a²) ).

But arcsin( a / sqrt(1 + a²) ) is equal to arctan(a). Because, let’s = a / sqrt(1 + a²). Let’s set θ = arcsin(s), then sinθ = a / sqrt(1 + a²). Then, tanθ = a / 1 = a, so θ = arctan(a). Therefore, arcsin(a / sqrt(1 + a²)) = arctan(a). Therefore,

J’(a) = (1/a) arctan(a).

So, J(a) = ∫ (1/a) arctan(a) da + C. We need to compute this integral. Let’s integrate (1/a) arctan(a) da. Let’s use integration by parts. Let u = arctan(a), dv = (1/a) da. Then du = (1/(1 + a²)) da, and v = ln a. So,

∫ (1/a) arctan(a) da = arctan(a) ln a - ∫ ln a * (1/(1 + a²)) da.

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let’s denote this integral as K = ∫ (1/a) arctan(a) da = arctan(a) ln a - ∫ [ln a / (1 + a²)] da.

The remaining integral ∫ [ln a / (1 + a²)] da. Let’s consider substitution. Let’s = a = tanθ, then da = sec²θ dθ, 1 + a² = sec²θ. So,

∫ [ln(tanθ) / sec²θ] * sec²θ dθ = ∫ ln(tanθ) dθ. Hmm, but this is ∫ ln(sinθ) - ln(cosθ) dθ = ∫ ln(sinθ) dθ - ∫ ln(cosθ) dθ. These integrals are known. The integral of ln(sinθ) dθ from 0 to π/2 is - (π/2) ln 2, but here we have indefinite integrals. Wait, but this approach might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding ln a / (1 + a²) into a series.

Alternatively, note that ∫ [ln a / (1 + a²)] da from 0 to ∞ is 0 due to symmetry, but we are dealing with indefinite integrals here. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another way to compute J(a).

Wait, we have J’(a) = (1/a) arctan(a). Let’s integrate this from a=0 to a=1. But J(a) is defined as ∫₀^{π/2} ln(a sinφ + sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)) dφ. When a=0, J(0) = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(0 + sqrt(1 + 0)) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} ln(1) dφ = 0. So J(1) = ∫₀^1 J’(a) da = ∫₀^1 (1/a) arctan(a) da.

So, we need to compute ∫₀^1 (arctan(a)/a) da. Let’s expand arctan(a) in a Taylor series. The Taylor series for arctan(a) around a=0 is a - a³/3 + a^5/5 - a^7/7 + ... for |a| ≤ 1. So,

arctan(a)/a = 1 - a²/3 + a^4/5 - a^6/7 + ... 

Integrate term by term:

∫₀^1 [1 - a²/3 + a^4/5 - a^6/7 + ...] da = [a - a³/(9) + a^5/(25) - a^7/(49) + ...] from 0 to 1.

Evaluating at 1: 1 - 1/9 + 1/25 - 1/49 + ... This is the series for the integral. This series is known as the Dirichlet beta function. Specifically, the integral ∫₀^1 (arctan(a)/a) da = ∑_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (2n + 1)^2 ]. This sum is known as Catalan's constant, denoted G. Catalan's constant is approximately 0.915965594177219... So, J(1) = G.

Therefore, the original integral I = 2 J(1) = 2G. Therefore, the value of the original integral is 2 times Catalan's constant.

But wait, let's recap. The original integral after substitutions became ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ = 2 J(1) = 2G. Therefore, the original integral from 0 to 2 is equal to 2G. So the exact answer is 2G, where G is Catalan's constant.

But let me verify this conclusion. Because the steps involved several substitutions and integrations, it's important to check if each step is correct.

Starting from the original integral:

∫₀² x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} ln(sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + x(2 - x))) dx.

Substitution x = 2 sin²θ, leading to integral 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sin(2θ)) dθ. Then substitution φ = 2θ, leading to ∫₀^π sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Then, using symmetry, split into two parts and found that it's 2 times ∫₀^{π/2} sinh^{-1}(sinφ) dφ. Then, through differentiation under the integral sign, arrived at J(1) = G. Therefore, the original integral is 2G.

Yes, this seems correct. Therefore, the exact value is 2 times Catalan's constant. The numerical value of Catalan's constant is approximately 0.915965594177219... So 2G is approximately 1.831931188354438... Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.8319311884.

Therefore, the exact answer is 2G, written in LaTeX as 2\mathbf{G}, where \mathbf{G} is the Catalan constant. However, in LaTeX, it's common to denote Catalan's constant as G, so the exact answer is 2G.
