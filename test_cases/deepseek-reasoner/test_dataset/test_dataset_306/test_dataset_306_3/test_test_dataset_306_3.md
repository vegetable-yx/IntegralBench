Okay, let's tackle this integral. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1/2) times the natural logarithm of [1.0*sqrt(x(2 - x)) + sqrt(1 + (1.0)^2 x(2 - x))] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I notice that the integrand has x^(-1/2) and (2 - x)^(-1/2). Those terms remind me of the Beta function or maybe a substitution that can simplify the expression. The Beta function is related to integrals of the form x^(a-1)(1 - x)^(b-1) from 0 to 1, but here the limits are from 0 to 2, and the exponents are both -1/2. Maybe a substitution can transform this into a Beta function form.

Let me try substituting t = 2u, so that when x = 0, u = 0, and x = 2, u = 1. Then dx = 2 du. Let's see:

The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 1 of (2u)^(-1/2)(2 - 2u)^(-1/2) * ln[1.0*sqrt(2u*(2 - 2u)) + sqrt(1 + (1.0)^2*2u*(2 - 2u))] * 2 du.

Simplifying the terms inside the radicals:

2u*(2 - 2u) = 4u(1 - u). So sqrt(4u(1 - u)) = 2*sqrt(u(1 - u)). Then the argument of the log becomes 1.0*2*sqrt(u(1 - u)) + sqrt(1 + (1.0)^2*4u(1 - u)).

Wait, 1.0 is just 1, so that simplifies to 2*sqrt(u(1 - u)) + sqrt(1 + 4u(1 - u)).

Let me check the substitution again. The x^(-1/2)(2 - x)^(-1/2) part becomes (2u)^(-1/2)*(2 - 2u)^(-1/2) = [2u * 2(1 - u)]^(-1/2) = [4u(1 - u)]^(-1/2) = 1/(2*sqrt(u(1 - u))). Then multiplied by the dx term, which is 2 du, so the whole coefficient becomes [1/(2*sqrt(u(1 - u)))] * 2 du = 1/sqrt(u(1 - u)) du.

So the integral simplifies to ∫ from 0 to 1 [1/sqrt(u(1 - u))] * ln[2*sqrt(u(1 - u)) + sqrt(1 + 4u(1 - u))] du.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, the integrand is 1/sqrt(u(1 - u)) times the log term. Let me see if the log term can be simplified. Let's denote y = sqrt(u(1 - u)). Then the argument inside the log is 2y + sqrt(1 + 4y²). Let me compute that expression:

2y + sqrt(1 + 4y²). Let me square this to see if it simplifies:

(2y + sqrt(1 + 4y²))² = 4y² + 4y*sqrt(1 + 4y²) + 1 + 4y² = 8y² + 1 + 4y*sqrt(1 + 4y²). Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe there's a hyperbolic identity here. Let me think. If I set sinh(t) = 2y, then sqrt(1 + 4y²) = cosh(t). Then 2y + sqrt(1 + 4y²) = sinh(t) + cosh(t) = e^t. So ln(2y + sqrt(1 + 4y²)) = ln(e^t) = t. Therefore, the log term simplifies to t, where sinh(t) = 2y. So t = arcsinh(2y). Therefore, the integrand becomes arcsinh(2y) / sqrt(u(1 - u)) du, where y = sqrt(u(1 - u)).

But y = sqrt(u(1 - u)) implies that y² = u - u², so 4y² = 4u - 4u². Then sinh(t) = 2y = 2*sqrt(u(1 - u)). So t = arcsinh(2*sqrt(u(1 - u))). Therefore, the integrand is arcsinh(2*sqrt(u(1 - u))) / sqrt(u(1 - u)) du.

Hmm, this substitution might not be making it easier. Let me think of another approach. Maybe a trigonometric substitution. Let me set u = sin²θ, so that when u = 0, θ = 0, and u = 1, θ = π/2. Then du = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(u(1 - u)) = sqrt(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ. Let's substitute:

The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to θ1 [1/(sinθ cosθ)] * ln[2 sinθ cosθ + sqrt(1 + 4 sin²θ cos²θ)] * 2 sinθ cosθ dθ. The 1/(sinθ cosθ) and 2 sinθ cosθ cancel out, leaving 2 ∫ ln[2 sinθ cosθ + sqrt(1 + 4 sin²θ cos²θ)] dθ from 0=0 to θ1=π/2.

Simplify the expression inside the log. Let's note that 2 sinθ cosθ = sin(2θ). Then the argument becomes sin(2θ) + sqrt(1 + sin²(2θ)). Wait, because 4 sin²θ cos²θ = (2 sinθ cosθ)^2 = sin²(2θ). Therefore, sqrt(1 + sin²(2θ)). So the argument is sin(2θ) + sqrt(1 + sin²(2θ)).

Again, let's consider hyperbolic functions. Let me set sinh(t) = sin(2θ). Then sqrt(1 + sinh²t) = cosh(t), so the argument becomes sinh(t) + cosh(t) = e^t. Therefore, ln(e^t) = t. So the integrand becomes t, where sinh(t) = sin(2θ). Therefore, t = arcsinh(sin(2θ)). Therefore, the integral becomes 2 ∫ arcsinh(sin(2θ)) dθ from 0 to π/2.

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me check if there's a substitution that can help. Let me set φ = 2θ. Then when θ = 0, φ = 0; θ = π/2, φ = π. Then dθ = dφ/2. The integral becomes 2 ∫ from 0 to π arcsinh(sinφ) * (dφ/2) = ∫ from 0 to π arcsinh(sinφ) dφ.

So now the integral is ∫₀^π arcsinh(sinφ) dφ. Hmm, that's an interesting integral. Let me see if I can compute this. Maybe using integration by parts. Let me set u = arcsinh(sinφ), dv = dφ. Then du = [cosφ / sqrt(1 + sin²φ)] dφ, and v = φ. Wait, but integration by parts would give uv - ∫ v du. So:

∫ arcsinh(sinφ) dφ = φ arcsinh(sinφ) - ∫ φ * [cosφ / sqrt(1 + sin²φ)] dφ.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry in the integral from 0 to π. Let me consider the function arcsinh(sinφ) over [0, π]. Since sinφ is symmetric around π/2, maybe we can split the integral into [0, π/2] and [π/2, π]. Let me substitute in the second interval: let φ = π - t. Then when φ = π/2, t = π/2; when φ = π, t = 0. Then the integral from π/2 to π becomes ∫ from 0 to π/2 arcsinh(sin(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫ from 0 to π/2 arcsinh(sin t) dt. Therefore, the entire integral is 2 ∫ from 0 to π/2 arcsinh(sinφ) dφ.

So now the integral is 2 times ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(sinφ) dφ. Let me focus on this integral. Let me make a substitution. Let me set t = sinφ. Then φ = arcsin t, dφ = dt / sqrt(1 - t²). The limits from 0 to π/2 become t from 0 to 1. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ arcsinh(t) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Hmm, but that might not be easier. Alternatively, maybe expand arcsinh(sinφ) into a series?

Alternatively, recall that arcsinh(z) = ln(z + sqrt(z² + 1)). So arcsinh(sinφ) = ln(sinφ + sqrt(sin²φ + 1)). But sqrt(sin²φ + 1) = sqrt(1 + sin²φ). So the integrand is ln(sinφ + sqrt(1 + sin²φ)). Wait, but this is similar to the original problem's logarithm term. Wait, but in the original problem, after substitutions, we ended up here. So maybe there's a connection.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known integral for ∫ arcsinh(sinφ) dφ. Let me check if I can express this in terms of known functions or constants. Alternatively, maybe differentiate under the integral sign. Let me consider a parameter. Let me define I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(a sinφ) dφ. Then perhaps differentiating I(a) with respect to a might lead to a manageable integral. Let's try that.

Compute I'(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} [sinφ / sqrt(1 + a² sin²φ)] dφ. Let me make substitution t = cosφ. Then when φ = 0, t = 1; φ = π/2, t = 0. dt = -sinφ dφ. So sinφ dφ = -dt. Then I'(a) becomes ∫ from 1 to 0 [ -dt) / sqrt(1 + a² (1 - t²)) ] = ∫₀¹ [1 / sqrt(1 + a² (1 - t²))] dt.

Simplify the denominator: 1 + a²(1 - t²) = 1 + a² - a² t² = (1 + a²) - a² t². So I'(a) = ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt((1 + a²) - a² t²) dt. Let me factor out sqrt(1 + a²) from the square root:

= ∫₀¹ 1 / [sqrt(1 + a²) sqrt(1 - (a² / (1 + a²)) t²)] dt = (1 / sqrt(1 + a²)) ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt(1 - [a² / (1 + a²)] t²) dt.

This integral is of the form ∫0^1 1 / sqrt(1 - k² t²) dt, which is [arcsin(kt)/k] from 0 to 1. So here, k = a / sqrt(1 + a²). Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1 / sqrt(1 + a²)) * [arcsin(k * 1) / k - arcsin(0)/k] = (1 / sqrt(1 + a²)) * [arcsin(a / sqrt(1 + a²)) / (a / sqrt(1 + a²)) ) ].

Simplify this expression: arcsin(a / sqrt(1 + a²)) is equal to arctan(a). Because if θ = arcsin(a / sqrt(1 + a²)), then sinθ = a / sqrt(1 + a²), so tanθ = a / 1, so θ = arctan(a). Therefore, arcsin(a / sqrt(1 + a²)) = arctan(a).

Therefore, substituting back:

I'(a) = (1 / sqrt(1 + a²)) * [ arctan(a) / (a / sqrt(1 + a²)) ) ] = (1 / sqrt(1 + a²)) * [ arctan(a) * sqrt(1 + a²) / a ) ] = arctan(a) / a.

Therefore, I'(a) = arctan(a) / a. Wait, that's a nice result. So then, to find I(a), we need to integrate I'(a) da. Since I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(a sinφ) dφ, and we have I'(a) = arctan(a) / a. Therefore, I(a) = ∫ [arctan(a) / a] da + C. We need to find the constant of integration. When a = 0, I(0) = ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(0) dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} 0 dφ = 0. So when a = 0, I(a) = 0. Let's check the integral of arctan(a)/a da from 0 to some a.

Let me denote J(a) = ∫ [arctan(a)/a] da. Let me perform substitution: let t = arctan(a). Then a = tan t, da = sec² t dt. Then J(a) becomes ∫ [t / tan t] * sec² t dt = ∫ t * (sec² t / tan t) dt = ∫ t * (1 / sin t cos t) dt. Because sec² t / tan t = (1 + tan² t)/tan t = (1/tan t) + tan t. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, integrate by parts. Let u = arctan(a), dv = (1/a) da. Then du = (1/(1 + a²)) da, and v = ln a. So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = arctan(a) ln a - ∫ ln a / (1 + a²) da. Hmm, but this seems more complicated. Maybe there's a series expansion for arctan(a)/a.

Recall that arctan(a) = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n a^{2n+1} / (2n +1) for |a| ≤ 1. Therefore, arctan(a)/a = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n a^{2n} / (2n +1). Then integrating term by term:

J(a) = ∫ [∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n a^{2n} / (2n +1)] da = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n / (2n +1) ∫ a^{2n} da = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n / (2n +1) * a^{2n +1} / (2n +1) ) + C = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n a^{2n +1} / (2n +1)^2 + C.

But this series is known as the inverse tangent integral, and it's related to the Dirichlet beta function. However, for our purposes, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to a. Therefore, J(a) = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n a^{2n +1} / (2n +1)^2. But this might not help us get a closed-form expression. Alternatively, perhaps there's a known integral for ∫ [arctan(a)/a] da. Let me check integral tables or recall that ∫₀^∞ (arctan(a)/a) da is known, but we need the indefinite integral. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of the dilogarithm function. Recall that Li_2(z) = -∫₀^z [ln(1 - t)/t] dt. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider that ∫ [arctan(a)/a] da can be expressed as (1/2) [Li_2(ia) - Li_2(-ia)] + C, but this might be getting too complex.

Alternatively, since we need to compute I(a) = ∫₀^a [arctan(t)/t] dt. Let me consider substitution t = tanθ, so θ = arctan(t), dt = sec²θ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{arctan(a)} [θ / tanθ] * sec²θ dθ = ∫₀^{arctan(a)} θ * (sec²θ / tanθ) dθ. Simplify sec²θ / tanθ = (1 + tan²θ)/tanθ = cotθ + tanθ. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{arctan(a)} θ (cotθ + tanθ) dθ = ∫₀^{arctan(a)} θ cotθ dθ + ∫₀^{arctan(a)} θ tanθ dθ.

Hmm, these integrals might not be straightforward solutions. Let me consider integrating θ cotθ. Integration by parts: let u = θ, dv = cotθ dθ. Then du = dθ, v = ln(sinθ). So ∫θ cotθ dθ = θ ln(sinθ) - ∫ ln(sinθ) dθ. The integral ∫ ln(sinθ) dθ is known to be related to the Clausen function, but this is getting too complicated. Similarly, ∫θ tanθ dθ can be integrated by parts, but again, it's not straightforward.

Perhaps there's a different approach. Let's recall that our original integral after substitution was I = ∫₀^π arcsinh(sinφ) dφ = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(sinφ) dφ. And we found that I(a) = ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(a sinφ) dφ, and I'(a) = arctan(a)/a. Therefore, I(a) = ∫₀^a [arctan(t)/t] dt. Therefore, our original integral I is 2 * I(1) = 2 * ∫₀^1 [arctan(t)/t] dt.

So we need to compute ∫₀^1 (arctan t)/t dt. Let me consider expanding arctan t into its Taylor series. As before, arctan t = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n t^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for |t| ≤ 1. Therefore, (arctan t)/t = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n t^{2n}/(2n+1). Integrating term by term from 0 to 1:

∫₀^1 (arctan t)/t dt = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n ∫₀^1 t^{2n}/(2n+1) dt = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n [1/(2n+1)] * [t^{2n+1}/(2n+1)] from 0 to 1 = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n / (2n+1)^2.

This series is known as the Dirichlet beta function evaluated at 2, which is β(2) = ∑_{n=0}^∞} (-1)^n / (2n+1)^2. It's known that β(2) = Catalan's constant G ≈ 0.915965594177219... So the integral ∫₀^1 (arctan t)/t dt = G. Therefore, our original integral I = 2G.

Therefore, going back through the substitutions, the original integral from 0 to 2 is equal to 2G. Therefore, the exact answer is 2 times Catalan's constant. The numerical value of Catalan's constant is approximately 0.9159655942, so multiplying by 2 gives approximately 1.8319311884. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.8319311884.

Let me verify this result by checking the steps again. Starting from the original integral, we made substitutions to transform it into an integral involving arcsinh(sinφ), then through differentiation under the integral sign, we found that the integral evaluates to 2G. This seems plausible. Catalan's constant often appears in integrals involving trigonometric functions and inverse hyperbolic functions, so this makes sense. Therefore, the exact answer is 2G, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.8319311884.
