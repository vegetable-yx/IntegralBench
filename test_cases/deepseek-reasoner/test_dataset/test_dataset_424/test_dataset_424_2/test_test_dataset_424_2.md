Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of sin(x)/(x² + 1) from -2023 to 2023. Hmm, let's start by recalling some integral properties. The function here is sin(x) divided by (x² + 1). First, I should check if the integrand is even or odd. Since sin(x) is an odd function and 1/(x² +1) is even, multiplying an odd and even function gives an odd function. Wait, odd times even is odd, right? Because odd*even = odd. So the integrand is an odd function.

But wait, integrating an odd function over symmetric limits, like from -a to a, should give zero. Because the area on the left cancels the area on the right. So does that mean the integral is zero? That seems too straightforward, but maybe that's the case here. Let me verify.

Let me think again. If f(x) is odd, then ∫_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 0. Yes, that's a standard result. So if the integrand here is indeed odd, then the integral from -2023 to 2023 would be zero. Let me confirm the parity of the function.

Given f(x) = sin(x)/(x² +1). Let's compute f(-x):

f(-x) = sin(-x)/( (-x)^2 +1 ) = -sin(x)/(x² +1) = -f(x). So yes, f(x) is odd. Therefore, the integral over symmetric limits is zero. So the exact answer should be 0. 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. The function 1/(x² +1) is even, sin(x) is odd, so their product is odd. The integral over symmetric interval would indeed be zero. So analytically, the answer is zero. Then the numerical approximation would also be zero, but maybe due to the limits being large, but since it's an exact result, the numerical approximation should be zero. But let me check with a smaller interval to see if that's the case. For example, integrating from -1 to 1, the integral should be zero. But maybe in reality, due to computational approximations, it's very close to zero. But in this case, since the problem is from -2023 to 2023, which is symmetric, the exact answer is zero. 

Wait, but sometimes even if the function is odd, if there's a discontinuity or something, but here the function is continuous everywhere because the denominator x² +1 is never zero. So the integral is indeed zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the approximation is 0.0000000000. 

But let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes integrals that look odd might not be straightforward. For example, if the function had an even component, but in this case, it's purely odd. So the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe using complex analysis? But that's overcomplicating. Since the integrand is odd, the integral is zero. So I think that's the answer. Let me just confirm with a substitution. Let u = -x. Then when x = -2023, u = 2023, and dx = -du. The integral becomes ∫_{2023}^{-2023} sin(-u)/(u² +1) (-du) = ∫_{2023}^{-2023} -sin(u)/(u² +1) (-du) = ∫_{2023}^{-2023} sin(u)/(u² +1) du = -∫_{-2023}^{2023} sin(u)/(u² +1) du. But the original integral is I, so I = -I, which implies 2I = 0, so I = 0. Yep, that confirms it. So the exact answer is 0. The numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.
