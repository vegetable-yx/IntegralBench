Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of sin(x)/(x² + 1) from -2023 to 2023. Hmm, let's start by recalling some integral properties. The function here is sin(x) divided by (x² + 1). First, I should check if the integrand is even or odd. Since sin(x) is an odd function and x² + 1 is even, the whole function sin(x)/(x² + 1) would be odd because odd divided by even is odd. But wait, integrating an odd function over symmetric limits around zero should give zero. Is that right? Let me confirm: the integral from -a to a of an odd function is indeed zero. So does that mean the integral here is zero?

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me make sure that the function is indeed odd. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x). Let's test f(-x) = sin(-x)/( (-x)^2 +1 ) = -sin(x)/(x² +1) = -f(x). Yes, that's correct. So the integrand is odd. Therefore, the integral over a symmetric interval around zero would be zero. So the exact answer should be 0. But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes even if the function is odd, if there's a discontinuity or something, but in this case, the denominator x² +1 is never zero, so the function is continuous everywhere. So integrating from -a to a of an odd function is zero. Therefore, regardless of the value of a, as long as it's symmetric, the integral is zero. So even if a is 2023, the integral is zero. 

But let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. For example, sometimes when integrating over infinite limits, even if the function is odd, the integral might not converge. But here, the limits are finite, from -2023 to 2023, so the integral is over a finite interval, and the function is continuous there. Therefore, the integral should be zero. 

But maybe the problem is expecting me to compute it through some other method. Let me try integrating it analytically. Let's consider integrating sin(x)/(x² +1) dx from -a to a. Let me make substitution. Let u = -x, then when x = -a, u = a, and x = a, u = -a. Then dx = -du. The integral becomes ∫ from a to -a of sin(-u)/(u² +1) (-du) = ∫ from a to -a of (-sin(u))/(u² +1) (-du) = ∫ from a to -a of sin(u)/(u² +1) du. Then reversing the limits, that becomes -∫ from -a to a of sin(u)/(u² +1) du. But the original integral is I, so this substitution gives I = -I, which implies that 2I = 0, so I = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe using complex analysis. But since the integral is over a finite interval, perhaps that's not necessary. But if I consider integrating from -∞ to ∞, then the integral can be evaluated using residues. Wait, but here the limits are finite. However, 2023 is a large number, but it's still finite. So maybe the integral from -∞ to ∞ is known, but here it's from -2023 to 2023. Let me check. The integral from -∞ to ∞ of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx. That can be evaluated using residues. Let me recall that. The integral is the imaginary part of ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx. Using the residue theorem, the poles are at x = i and x = -i. Since we're integrating over the real line, we close the contour in the upper half-plane for e^{ix}, as the exponential decays there. The residue at x = i is e^{-1}/(2i). So the integral is 2πi * (e^{-1}/(2i)) ) = π/e. Therefore, the integral from -∞ to ∞ of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx is π/e. But our problem is from -2023 to 2023. So as 2023 approaches infinity, the integral approaches π/e. But since 2023 is finite, the integral is not exactly π/e. However, the problem is asking for the integral from -2023 to 2023, which is over a symmetric interval. But earlier, we thought that the integral is zero because the integrand is odd. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) from -a to a is zero because it's an odd function. But the integral from -∞ to ∞ is π/e. How is that possible?

Wait, there's a mistake here. Wait, sin(x) is odd, but x² +1 is even, so the integrand is odd. Therefore, integrating over symmetric limits should give zero. But the integral from -∞ to ∞ of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx is zero? But earlier, when I computed using residues, I thought it was π/e. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, the integral of e^{ix}/(x² +1) from -∞ to ∞ is π/e, and the imaginary part of that is the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx. But if the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx from -∞ to ∞ is π/e, but according to the odd function argument, it should be zero. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?

Wait, no. Wait, the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) from -∞ to ∞ is indeed zero, because it's an odd function. But when I compute the integral of e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx, which is a complex function, the real part is even and the imaginary part is odd. Therefore, the integral of e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx is equal to the integral of cos(x)/(x² +1) dx plus i times the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx. But since the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx over the entire real line is zero, the integral of e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx is equal to the integral of cos(x)/(x² +1) dx, which is π/e. Therefore, the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx from -∞ to ∞ is zero. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous residue calculation. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, when I compute ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx. The function e^{iz}/(z² +1) has poles at z = i and z = -i. Closing the contour in the upper half-plane (since e^{iz} decays there as |z| goes to infinity), we pick up the residue at z = i. The residue at z = i is e^{i(i)}/(2i) = e^{-1}/(2i). Then the integral is 2πi * residue = 2πi * (e^{-1}/(2i)) ) = π/e. Therefore, the integral of e^{ix}/(x² +1) dx from -infty to infty is π/e. Therefore, the real part is ∫_{-infty}^infty cos(x)/(x² +1) dx = π/e, and the imaginary part ∫_{-infty}^infty sin(x)/(x² +1) dx = 0. So that's correct. Therefore, the integral of sin(x)/(x² +1) over the entire real line is zero. But over a finite interval, say from -a to a, it's also zero because the integrand is odd. So in our problem, the integral from -2023 to 2023 is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0. But wait, the numerical approximation would also be zero? But maybe due to computational errors, but if the exact answer is zero, then the numerical approximation would be a very small number close to zero. But let's check.

Wait, but maybe the integral is not exactly zero. Wait, but according to the function being odd, the integral over symmetric limits is exactly zero. So the exact answer is zero. Therefore, the numerical approximation would be zero. But let me check with a smaller interval. For example, integrate from -1 to 1 of sin(x)/(x² +1) dx. Let's compute it numerically. Let's approximate it. Let me compute ∫_{-1}^1 sin(x)/(x² +1) dx. Since the function is odd, the integral should be zero. Let's check with a simple approximation. For example, using symmetry: the integral from -a to a is 0. So yes, the exact answer is zero. Therefore, regardless of a, as long as the interval is symmetric, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. So the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. But maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Let me think again. Wait, but the function is odd, so integrating over symmetric interval gives zero. So the answer is zero. Therefore, the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. Therefore, the JSON should be {"answer": "0", "numerical_answer": "0.0000000000"}. But let me check with a numerical example. Suppose I take a=1. Let's compute ∫_{-1}^1 sin(x)/(x² +1) dx numerically. Let's compute it using substitution. Let me use substitution x = -t. Then the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{-1} sin(-t)/(t² +1) (-dt) = ∫_{-1}^1 -sin(t)/(t² +1) (-dt) = ∫_{-1}^1 sin(t)/(t² +1) dt. So the integral is equal to itself, which implies that I = -I, so 2I = 0, so I=0. Therefore, the integral is zero. Therefore, regardless of the interval, as long as it's symmetric, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. So the exact answer is 0, and the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000. Therefore, the final answer is as above.
