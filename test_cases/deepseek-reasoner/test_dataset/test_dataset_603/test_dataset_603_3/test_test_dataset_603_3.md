Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2π of 1 divided by (1 plus the square root of (1 minus sin squared x)) dx. Hmm. First, I remember that 1 - sin²x is cos²x, so the integrand simplifies a bit. Let me write that down.

So the integral becomes ∫₀²π [1 / (1 + √(cos²x))] dx. But wait, the square root of cos²x is the absolute value of cosx, right? Because √(a²) = |a|. So that means √(1 - sin²x) = |cosx|. Therefore, the integrand is 1 / (1 + |cosx|).

Now, integrating 1/(1 + |cosx|) from 0 to 2π. The absolute value complicates things because cosx is positive in some intervals and negative in others. So I need to split the integral into regions where cosx is non-negative and non-positive. Let me recall that cosx is positive in [-π/2, π/2] and negative in [π/2, 3π/2] within the interval [0, 2π]. So maybe I can split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π and π to 2π, but wait, actually cosx is positive from 0 to π/2 and from 3π/2 to 2π, and negative from π/2 to 3π/2. Wait, no. Let me think again. Cosx is positive in [0, π/2) and (3π/2, 2π], and negative in (π/2, 3π/2). So over 0 to 2π, the absolute value |cosx| will be cosx in [0, π/2] and [3π/2, 2π], and -cosx in [π/2, 3π/2]. Therefore, the integral can be split into three parts: 0 to π/2, π/2 to 3π/2, and 3π/2 to 2π. But since the function is periodic and symmetric, maybe there's a smarter way to handle this.

Alternatively, since the integrand is even around π, maybe we can exploit symmetry. Let me check. The function 1/(1 + |cosx|) has a period of π? Wait, cosx has a period of 2π, but with the absolute value, |cosx| has a period of π. So the integrand 1/(1 + |cosx|) also has a period of π. Therefore, the integral from 0 to 2π would be twice the integral from 0 to π. That simplifies things. So instead of integrating over 2π, I can compute 2 times the integral from 0 to π. Let me confirm that. If the function has period π, then integrating over any interval of length π will give the same result. So ∫₀²π f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^π f(x) dx. That seems right. So now, the integral becomes 2 times ∫₀^π [1 / (1 + |cosx|)] dx. But within [0, π], cosx is positive from 0 to π/2 and negative from π/2 to π. Therefore, |cosx| is cosx in [0, π/2] and -cosx in [π/2, π]. So we can split the integral into two parts: 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. Therefore, the integral becomes 2 [ ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + cosx) dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cosx) dx ].

Now, let's compute each integral separately. Let's start with the first one: ∫ 1/(1 + cosx) dx. There's a standard technique for integrating 1/(1 + cosx). One method is to multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cosx) to rationalize. Let's try that.

So, ∫ 1/(1 + cosx) dx = ∫ [ (1 - cosx) / ( (1 + cosx)(1 - cosx) ) ] dx = ∫ (1 - cosx)/(1 - cos²x) dx = ∫ (1 - cosx)/sin²x dx. Then split the integral into two terms: ∫ 1/sin²x dx - ∫ cosx/sin²x dx. The first integral is ∫ csc²x dx, which is -cotx + C. The second integral is ∫ cosx/sin²x dx. Let me set u = sinx, then du = cosx dx. So ∫ cosx/sin²x dx = ∫ du/u² = -1/u + C = -1/sinx + C. Therefore, combining both terms: -cotx + 1/sinx + C. Simplify: -cotx + cscx + C. Let's check that. Hmm, cotx is cosx/sinx, so -cotx + cscx = -cosx/sinx + 1/sinx = (1 - cosx)/sinx. Which is the integrand after rationalization. So that's correct.

Alternatively, another method is to use the substitution t = tan(x/2), which is the Weierstrass substitution. Let me try that as well. Let t = tan(x/2), so dx = 2/(1 + t²) dt, and cosx = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²). Then, 1/(1 + cosx) becomes 1/(1 + (1 - t²)/(1 + t²)) = (1 + t²)/(2) ). So the integral becomes ∫ [ (1 + t²)/2 ] * [2/(1 + t²)] dt = ∫ 1 dt = t + C = tan(x/2) + C. So that's another way. Therefore, ∫ 1/(1 + cosx) dx = tan(x/2) + C. Let me check this. The derivative of tan(x/2) is (1/2) sec²(x/2) = (1/2)(1 + tan²(x/2)) = (1/2)(1 + t²). But when we did substitution, dx = 2 dt/(1 + t²), so the integral becomes ∫1 dt, which is t. So yes, the integral is tan(x/2) + C. So that's simpler. So the first integral from 0 to π/2 is [tan(x/2)] from 0 to π/2. At π/2, tan(π/4) = 1. At 0, tan(0) = 0. So the first integral is 1 - 0 = 1.

Now, the second integral: ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cosx) dx. Similarly, we can use the same approach. Let's use the Weierstrass substitution again. Let t = tan(x/2). Then, cosx = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²). So 1 - cosx = 1 - (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) = ( (1 + t²) - (1 - t²) ) / (1 + t²) ) = (2t²)/(1 + t²). Therefore, 1/(1 - cosx) = (1 + t²)/(2t²). Then, dx = 2/(1 + t²) dt. So the integral becomes ∫ [ (1 + t²)/(2t²) ] * [2/(1 + t²) ] dt = ∫ 1/t² dt = -1/t + C = -cot(x/2) + C. Wait, but let's check. Alternatively, using substitution t = tan(x/2), when x is in [π/2, π], t ranges from tan(π/4) = 1 to tan(π/2) which approaches infinity. Wait, but when x approaches π from below, tan(x/2) approaches tan(π/2) which is infinity. So integrating from π/2 to π would correspond to t from 1 to infinity. So the integral becomes ∫_{1}^{∞} 1/t² dt = [ -1/t ] from 1 to ∞ = 0 - (-1/1) = 1. Wait, that's interesting. So the integral from π/2 to π of 1/(1 - cosx) dx is 1. Alternatively, using the antiderivative -cot(x/2), evaluated from π/2 to π. At x = π, -cot(π/2) = -0 (since cot(π/2) is 0). At x = π/2, -cot(π/4) = -1. So the integral is (-0) - (-1) = 1. So that's correct.

Therefore, the two integrals from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π are both 1. So the integral over 0 to π is 1 + 1 = 2. Then, the original integral is 2 * 2 = 4. Wait, wait. Wait, the original integral was 2 times the integral from 0 to π. Which is 2*(1 + 1) = 4. So the answer is 4? Let me check again.

Wait, let's recap. The original integral is from 0 to 2π. We split it into two parts because the function has period π. So ∫₀²π f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^π f(x) dx. Then, ∫₀^π f(x) dx is split into ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + cosx) dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cosx) dx. Each of those integrals is 1, so total 2. Then multiply by 2, giving 4. So the integral is 4. Hmm. That seems straightforward, but let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider the substitution for the entire interval. Let me check if there's a symmetry or substitution that can make this easier. For example, using x = π - t or something. But maybe not necessary here.

Alternatively, let's compute the integral over 0 to 2π directly. Since |cosx| is symmetric, perhaps we can use substitution. Let me try substituting t = x - π/2. But not sure. Alternatively, note that the integrand is 1/(1 + |cosx|). Since |cosx| is even symmetry around 0 and π. But maybe integrating over 0 to 2π, we can use the periodicity. Wait, but we already considered the period is π, so integrating over 0 to π and doubling it. So the result is 4. Let me check with a numerical approximation. If the exact answer is 4, then numerically it should be approximately 4.0. Let me compute a numerical approximation. For example, take x = 0, the integrand is 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5. At x = π/2, integrand is 1/(1 + 0) = 1. At x = π, integrand is 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5. Similarly, over the interval, the function is 0.5 when |cosx| is 1, and 1 when |cosx| is 0. So integrating over 0 to 2π, the average value might be around 0.5*(something) but the exact answer is 4. Wait, but 4 is 2π times some average value. Wait, 2π is approximately 6.283, so 4 is less than that. Wait, but according to the calculation, the integral is 4. Let me check with a simple numerical estimate. Let's approximate the integral by taking sample points. For example, in the interval [0, π/2], cosx is positive, so integrand is 1/(1 + cosx). Let's take x=0: 1/2. x=π/4: 1/(1 + √2/2) ≈ 1/(1 + 0.707) ≈ 1/1.707 ≈ 0.586. x=π/2: 1/(1 + 0) = 1. So maybe the integrand averages around 0.7 in [0, π/2], which is length π/2 ≈ 1.57. So 0.7*1.57≈1.1. Similarly, in [π/2, 3π/2], |cosx| is -cosx, so integrand is 1/(1 - cosx). At x=π: 1/(1 - (-1)) = 1/2. At x=3π/4: 1/(1 - (-√2/2)) ≈1/(1 + 0.707)≈0.586. At x=π/2: 1/(1 - 0)=1. So similar to the first interval. Then, over [π/2, π], the integral would be similar to [0, π/2], and same for the other half. But according to the analytical solution, the integral over 0 to 2π is 4. Let me check with a simple numerical integration. Suppose I use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. For example, divide 0 to 2π into four intervals: 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π. The function at these points: 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5. Using the trapezoidal rule: each interval is π/2. The first interval (0 to π/2): average of 0.5 and 1 is 0.75, times π/2 ≈ 1.178. Second interval (π/2 to π): average of 1 and 0.5 is 0.75, times π/2 ≈1.178. Third interval (π to 3π/2): average of 0.5 and 1 is 0.75, times π/2 ≈1.178. Fourth interval (3π/2 to 2π): average of 1 and 0.5 is 0.75, times π/2 ≈1.178. Total approximation: 4*1.178 ≈4.712. But the exact answer is 4, so this is overestimating. But trapezoidal rule with only four intervals is not accurate. Let's try more intervals. For example, 8 intervals. Each interval is π/4. Let's compute the function at 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4, 2π. The function values:

At 0: 0.5

At π/4: 1/(1 + cos(π/4)) = 1/(1 + √2/2) ≈1/(1.707)≈0.586

At π/2:1

At 3π/4:1/(1 + |cos(3π/4)|)=1/(1 + √2/2)≈0.586

At π:0.5

At 5π/4:1/(1 + |cos(5π/4)|)=1/(1 + √2/2)≈0.586

At 3π/2:1

At 7π/4:1/(1 + |cos(7π/4)|)=1/(1 + √2/2)≈0.586

At 2π:0.5

So the trapezoidal rule with 8 intervals:

Each interval is π/4 ≈0.7854.

Sum over the intervals:

First interval (0 to π/4): average of 0.5 and 0.586 ≈0.543, times π/4 ≈0.543*0.785≈0.426

Second interval (π/4 to π/2): average of 0.586 and 1 ≈0.793, times π/4≈0.793*0.785≈0.623

Third interval (π/2 to 3π/4): average of 1 and 0.586≈0.793, times π/4≈0.623

Fourth interval (3π/4 to π): average of 0.586 and 0.5≈0.543, times π/4≈0.426

Fifth interval (π to 5π/4): same as first interval:0.426

Sixth interval (5π/4 to 3π/2): same as second:0.623

Seventh interval (3π/2 to 7π/4): same as third:0.623

Eighth interval (7π/4 to 2π): same as fourth:0.426

Total sum: 2*(0.426 +0.623 +0.623 +0.426) = 2*(2.098)≈4.196. Still higher than 4, but closer. So with more intervals, it approaches 4. So the exact answer is 4. So the analytical solution is 4. Therefore, the exact answer is 4, and numerically it's 4.0. But wait, the problem says to provide a numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places. If the exact answer is 4, then the numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. But maybe I should check with a more precise method. Let me compute the integral using substitution.

Wait, but according to the analytical solution, the integral is exactly 4. Let me verify again. The integral over 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + cosx) dx is 1, and the integral over π/2 to π of 1/(1 - cosx) dx is 1. So over 0 to π, it's 2, and multiplied by 2 gives 4. So yes, the exact answer is 4. Wait, no. Wait, the original integral is from 0 to 2π. We split it into two intervals of length π each. Then, each integral over π is 2, so total 4. So yes, the exact answer is 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. So the final answer is 4. But let me check with another approach. Let's use substitution. Let me consider substituting t = x - π/2. But not sure. Alternatively, use symmetry. The function 1/(1 + |cosx|) is even around x=0 and x=π. But maybe not necessary. Alternatively, use the identity that the integral over 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + cosx) dx is 1, and similarly for the other parts. So, I think the analytical answer is 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 4.0. So the JSON output should be {"answer": "4", "numerical_answer": "4.0000000000"}.

But wait, let me check once more. Let's compute the integral using substitution. Let me compute ∫₀^{2π} 1/(1 + |cosx|) dx. Let's split the integral into four parts where cosx is positive or negative. But since |cosx| has period π, integrating over 0 to π and doubling. So ∫₀^{2π} f(x) dx = 2 ∫₀^π f(x) dx. Then, ∫₀^π f(x) dx = ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + cosx) dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cosx) dx. As before, each integral is 1, so total 2. Multiply by 2, get 4. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the exact answer is 4. So the numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. Therefore, the final answer is as above.
