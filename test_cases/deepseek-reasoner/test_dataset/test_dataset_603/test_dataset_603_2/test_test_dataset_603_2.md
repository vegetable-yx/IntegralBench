Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2π of 1 divided by (1 plus the square root of (1 minus sin squared x)) dx. Hmm. First, I remember that 1 - sin²x is cos²x, so the integrand simplifies a bit. Let me write that down.

So the integral becomes ∫₀²π [1 / (1 + √(cos²x))] dx. But wait, the square root of cos²x is the absolute value of cos x, right? Because √(a²) = |a|. So that means √(1 - sin²x) = |cos x|. Therefore, the integrand is 1 / (1 + |cos x|).

Now, integrating 1 over (1 + |cos x|) from 0 to 2π. The absolute value complicates things a bit. Since the cosine function is positive in some intervals and negative in others, I need to split the integral into regions where cos x is non-negative and non-positive. But over 0 to 2π, cos x is positive in [-π/2, π/2] and negative in [π/2, 3π/2], but since our interval is from 0 to 2π, let's adjust that. Cos x is positive from 0 to π/2 and from 3π/2 to 2π, and negative from π/2 to 3π/2. Wait, actually, cos x is positive in [0, π/2) and (3π/2, 2π], and negative in (π/2, 3π/2). So maybe I should split the integral into three parts? Wait, no. Let me think again. From 0 to π, cos x is positive in [0, π/2) and negative in (π/2, π]. Then from π to 3π/2, cos x is negative, and from 3π/2 to 2π, cos x is positive again. So actually, the absolute value of cos x is symmetric over the interval of π. Wait, but maybe there's a better way to handle the absolute value by using symmetry.

Alternatively, since the integrand involves |cos x|, and the function is periodic with period π, maybe we can exploit symmetry. Let me check: the function 1/(1 + |cos x|) has period π because |cos(x + π)| = |cos x|. So integrating over 0 to 2π is the same as twice the integral from 0 to π. Wait, no. Wait, if the period is π, then integrating over 0 to 2π would be twice the integral over 0 to π. Let me confirm. Since the function repeats every π, then yes, the integral from 0 to 2π is 2 times the integral from 0 to π. So maybe that's a useful simplification.

But let's check that. Let's take x from 0 to π, and then from π to 2π. In the interval π to 2π, cos x is the same as cos(x - π), which is -cos(x - π). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For x in [π, 2π], let’s set t = x - π. Then cos x = cos(t + π) = -cos t. So |cos x| = | - cos t | = |cos t|. Therefore, the function 1/(1 + |cos x|) over [π, 2π] is the same as 1/(1 + |cos t|) where t is from 0 to π. Therefore, the integral from π to 2π is equal to the integral from 0 to π. Therefore, the total integral from 0 to 2π is 2 times the integral from 0 to π. So that's helpful. So now, I can focus on computing 2 times the integral from 0 to π of 1/(1 + |cos x|) dx.

But in the interval from 0 to π, cos x is positive in [0, π/2) and negative in (π/2, π]. Therefore, |cos x| is equal to cos x in [0, π/2] and -cos x in [π/2, π]. Therefore, the integral from 0 to π can be split into two parts: from 0 to π/2, where |cos x| = cos x, and from π/2 to π, where |cos x| = -cos x. Therefore, the integral becomes:

2 [ ∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + cos x) dx + ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cos x) dx ]

So now, we have two integrals to compute. Let's handle them one by one.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1 + cos x) dx from 0 to π/2.

Second integral: ∫ 1/(1 - cos x) dx from π/2 to π.

I recall that integrals of 1/(1 ± cos x) can be simplified using trigonometric identities. For example, multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 ∓ cos x) to use the identity 1 - cos²x = sin²x.

Let's start with the first integral: ∫ 1/(1 + cos x) dx.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - cos x):

∫ [ (1 - cos x) / ( (1 + cos x)(1 - cos x) ) ] dx = ∫ [ (1 - cos x) / (1 - cos²x) ] dx = ∫ (1 - cos x)/sin²x dx.

Which can be split into ∫ 1/sin²x dx - ∫ cos x / sin²x dx.

We know that 1/sin²x is csc²x, whose integral is -cot x + C.

The second integral: ∫ cos x / sin²x dx. Let’s set u = sin x, then du = cos x dx. So integral becomes ∫ du / u² = -1/u + C = -1/sin x + C.

Therefore, the first integral becomes:

[ -cot x + 1/sin x ] evaluated from 0 to π/2.

Similarly, let's compute the second integral: ∫ 1/(1 - cos x) dx from π/2 to π.

Again, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos x):

∫ [ (1 + cos x) / ( (1 - cos x)(1 + cos x) ) ] dx = ∫ (1 + cos x)/sin²x dx.

Again, split into ∫ 1/sin²x dx + ∫ cos x / sin²x dx.

Which is similar to the first integral. The integral becomes:

[ -cot x - 1/sin x ] evaluated from π/2 to π.

So putting it all together:

First integral result:

At π/2: -cot(π/2) + 1/sin(π/2) = -0 + 1/1 = 1.

At 0: -cot(0) + 1/sin(0). But cot(0) is cos(0)/sin(0) which is 1/0, which tends to infinity. Similarly, 1/sin(0) is also infinity. Wait, but this seems problematic. Wait, but we have to evaluate the integral from 0 to π/2. However, at x=0, the original integrand 1/(1 + cos x) becomes 1/2, which is finite. Wait, but when we did the substitution, we transformed the integral into [ -cot x + 1/sin x ] from 0 to π/2. Let's check that.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the integration steps. Let me verify.

Original integral: ∫ 1/(1 + cos x) dx.

After substitution: ∫ (1 - cos x)/sin²x dx = ∫ (1/sin²x - cos x/sin²x) dx.

Integrate term by term:

∫ 1/sin²x dx = -cot x + C.

∫ cos x/sin²x dx. Let u = sin x, du = cos x dx. So integral becomes ∫ du/u² = -1/u + C = -1/sin x + C.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(-cot x) - (-1/sin x) + C = -cot x + 1/sin x + C.

So evaluated from 0 to π/2.

At π/2: -cot(π/2) + 1/sin(π/2) = -0 + 1 = 1.

At 0: -cot(0) + 1/sin(0). But cot(0) is infinity (since cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0), and 1/sin(0) is also infinity. But we need to compute the limit as x approaches 0 from the right.

Let’s compute the limit as x approaches 0+ of [ -cot x + 1/sin x ].

cot x = cos x / sin x, so:

- cot x + 1/sin x = - (cos x / sin x) + 1/sin x = (1 - cos x)/sin x.

As x approaches 0, 1 - cos x ~ x²/2, and sin x ~ x. Therefore, (1 - cos x)/sin x ~ (x²/2)/x = x/2, which approaches 0. Therefore, the limit as x approaches 0+ is 0.

Therefore, the first integral evaluates to 1 - 0 = 1.

Similarly, the second integral: ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cos x) dx.

After substitution, we have [ -cot x - 1/sin x ] evaluated from π/2 to π.

At π: -cot π - 1/sin π. cot π is cos π / sin π = (-1)/0, which is undefined, but again, we need to take the limit as x approaches π from the left.

Similarly, let's compute the expression at x approaching π from the left:

- cot x - 1/sin x = - (cos x / sin x) - 1/sin x = (-cos x - 1)/sin x.

At x approaching π from the left, cos x approaches -1, so numerator: -(-1) -1 = 1 -1 = 0. Denominator sin x approaches 0 from the positive side (since sin(π - ε) = sin ε ~ ε). So numerator approaches 0, denominator approaches 0. Let's apply L’Hospital’s Rule.

Let’s set x = π - t, t approaching 0+.

Numerator: -cos(π - t) -1 = -(-cos t) -1 = cos t -1 ~ -t²/2.

Denominator: sin(π - t) = sin t ~ t.

So the expression) becomes (-cos t -1)/sin t = (cos t -1)/sin t ~ (-t²/2)/t = -t/2 → 0 as t→0.

Therefore, the limit as x approaches π from the left is 0.

At π/2: -cot(π/2) -1/sin(π/2) = -0 -1 = -1.

Therefore, the second integral evaluates to [0 - (-1)] = 1.

Therefore, the two integrals each evaluate to 1, so the integral from 0 to π is 1 + 1 = 2. Then multiplying by 2 gives the original integral from 0 to 2π as 2 * 2 = 4.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the exact value is 4? Let me check again.

Wait, the integral from 0 to 2π is 2 times the integral from 0 to π. The integral from 0 to π is split into two parts, each part evaluated to 1, so total 2. Then 2 * 2 = 4. So the exact answer is 4.

But let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe using substitution or another identity.

Alternatively, consider the original integrand: 1/(1 + |cos x|). Since |cos x| is symmetric properties, perhaps we can use substitution t = x - π/2 or something else. But maybe another approach.

Alternatively, use the substitution t = tan(x/2), which is the Weierstrass substitution. Let's try that.

Let’s set t = tan(x/2). Then, dx = 2/(1 + t²) dt, and cos x = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²). However, since we have |cos x|, we need to be careful with the substitution over different intervals. But given that we already split the integral and found 4, maybe this is redundant, but let's check.

Alternatively, let's compute the integral of 1/(1 + |cos x|) over 0 to 2π. Since |cos x| is symmetric with period π, as we did before, the integral is 2 times the integral from 0 to π of 1/(1 + |cos x|) dx. Then, split into 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π, each integral being 1/(1 + cos x) and 1/(1 - cos x). Then, each integral evaluated to 1, so total 2*2=4. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, let's compute the integral to check numerically. Let's compute the numerical approximation. If the exact answer is 4, then the numerical approximation should be approximately 4.0. Let me check with a simple numerical integration.

For example, take x=0: integrand is 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5. At x=π/2: integrand is 1/(1 + 0) = 1. At x=π: integrand is 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5. Similarly, at x=3π/2: integrand is 1/(1 + 0) =1. So the function is symmetric, oscillating between 0.5 and 1. The integral over 0 to 2π would be the area under this curve. But since we split it into regions where the integral evaluates to 1 each, leading to 4. So the exact answer is 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 4.0000000000.

But wait, let me compute numerically. Let's take a simple case. Suppose we use the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. For example, from 0 to 2π, split into 4 intervals: 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π. The function at these points: 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5. The trapezoidal rule would give: (π/2)/2 [0.5 + 2*1 + 2*0.5 + 2*1 + 0.5] = (π/4)[0.5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0.5] = (π/4)(6) = (3/2)π ≈ 4.712... which is larger than 4. But this is a very rough approximation. If we take more intervals, it should approach 4. Let's try with more points. For example, using Simpson's rule. But maybe this is time-consuming. Alternatively, since the exact answer is 4, and the integral is 4, the numerical approximation should be 4.0000000000. But let me check with another method.

Alternatively, consider that the integral over 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + cos x) dx. Let's compute this integral. As we did before, it's 1. Similarly, the integral from π/2 to π of 1/(1 - cos x) dx is also 1. So total over 0 to π is 2, times 2 gives 4. So exact answer is 4. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 4.0.

But let me check with substitution. Let’s compute the first integral again:

∫₀^{π/2} 1/(1 + cos x) dx.

Using the identity 1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2). Therefore, 1/(1 + cos x) = 1/(2 cos²(x/2)) = (1/2) sec²(x/2). The integral of sec² is tan. Therefore, ∫ (1/2) sec²(x/2) dx = (1/2) * 2 tan(x/2) ) + C = tan(x/2) + C. Evaluated from 0 to π/2: tan(π/4) - tan(0) = 1 - 0 = 1. So that's correct.

Similarly, the second integral: ∫_{π/2}^π 1/(1 - cos x) dx.

Using 1 - cos x = 2 sin²(x/2). Therefore, 1/(1 - cos x) = 1/(2 sin²(x/2)) = (1/2) csc²(x/2). The integral of csc² is -cot. Therefore, ∫ (1/2) csc²(x/2) dx = (1/2)(-2 cot(x/2)) + C = -cot(x/2) + C. Evaluated from π/2 to π: -cot(π/2) - (-cot(π/4)) = -0 - (-1) = 1. So that's correct. Therefore, the integrals each evaluate to 1, so total 2*2=4. So exact answer is 4.

Therefore, the numerical approximation is exactly 4.0000000000. So the answer is 4.
