Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of (1/x) * arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the integrand. The function is x inverse multiplied by the arctangent of the square root of x times (2 - x). The limits are from 0 to 2. 

First, maybe I should check if there's a substitution that can simplify the expression inside the arctan. The term under the square root is x(2 - x), which looks like a quadratic. Let me see, x(2 - x) = 2x - x². That's a downward opening parabola with roots at x=0 and x=2. The maximum occurs at x=1, where the value is 1. So sqrt(x(2 - x)) is real between 0 and 2, which matches the integration limits. 

The integrand is (1/x) * arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))). Maybe substitution can help here. Let me consider substituting t = x - 1, which might symmetrize the expression. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a trigonometric substitution. Since the expression under the square root is similar to 1 - (x - 1)^2, because expanding (x - 1)^2 gives x² - 2x + 1, so 1 - (x - 1)^2 = 1 - x² + 2x -1 = 2x - x². Yes! So sqrt(x(2 - x)) = sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2). That's useful. So maybe substitute x - 1 = sinθ or something like that. Let's try that.

Let me set x = 1 + sinθ. Then dx = cosθ dθ. But when x goes from 0 to 2, sinθ goes from -1 to 1, so θ goes from -π/2 to π/2. Hmm, but integrating over symmetric limits might help. Let's see. However, the original integrand is (1/x) arctan(sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2)). So substituting x = 1 + sinθ, then sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2) becomes sqrt(1 - sin²θ) = cosθ. So the integrand becomes arctan(cosθ) / (1 + sinθ) * cosθ dθ. Wait, let's check:

Original integral: ∫ [arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x)))/x] dx from 0 to 2.

After substitution x = 1 + sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(x(2 - x)) = sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2) = cosθ. So arctan(cosθ). The denominator x becomes 1 + sinθ. So the integral becomes ∫ [arctan(cosθ) / (1 + sinθ)] * cosθ dθ, with θ from -π/2 to π/2. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, let's consider integrating by parts. Let u = arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) and dv = (1/x) dx. Then du would be the derivative of arctan, which is [1/(1 + x(2 - x))] * derivative of sqrt(x(2 - x)). Let's compute that. 

First, derivative of arctan(u) is u'/(1 + u²). Here, u = sqrt(x(2 - x)). So u' = (1/(2 sqrt(x(2 - x)))) * (2 - 2x) = (2 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(x(2 - x))) = (1 - x)/sqrt(x(2 - x)). Therefore, du = [ (1 - x)/sqrt(x(2 - x)) ] / (1 + x(2 - x)) dx. The denominator 1 + x(2 - x) is 1 + 2x - x². Let's compute that: 1 + 2x - x² = -(x² - 2x -1). Hmm, not sure. 

But integrating by parts with u = arctan(...) and dv = (1/x) dx would lead to v = ln|x|. So the integral becomes uv| from 0 to 2 minus ∫ v du. But evaluating uv at 0 might be problematic because ln(0) is negative infinity. Let's check the original integrand at x=0. As x approaches 0, arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) ~ arctan(sqrt(2x)) ~ sqrt(2x). So (1/x)*sqrt(2x) = sqrt(2)/sqrt(x), which tends to infinity. Wait, but the integral from 0 to 2 of (1/x) arctan(...) dx. If near 0, the integrand behaves like sqrt(2)/sqrt(x), which is integrable because the integral of x^{-1/2} converges. Similarly at x=2, similar behavior. So the integral is convergent.

But integrating by parts might not be straightforward. Let's see. If we proceed with u = arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) and dv = (1/x) dx, then v = ln x. So uv from 0 to 2 is [arctan(sqrt(2*0)) ln 2 - lim_{x→0} arctan(...) ln x]. Wait, arctan(sqrt(0)) is arctan(0) = 0, so the first term is 0. The second term is lim_{x→0} arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) ln x. As x→0, sqrt(x(2 - x)) ~ sqrt(2x), so arctan(sqrt(2x)) ~ sqrt(2x). So the limit is sqrt(2x) * ln x, which tends to 0 (since sqrt(x) goes to 0 and ln x goes to -infty, but sqrt(x) dominates). So the limit is 0. Therefore, uv part is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the integral becomes -∫ v du = -∫ ln x * [ (1 - x)/sqrt(x(2 - x)) / (1 + x(2 - x)) ] dx. Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe not helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's consider substitution. Let t = x - 1. Then x = t + 1, dx = dt. The limits from x=0 to x=2 become t=-1 to t=1. The integrand becomes (1/(t + 1)) arctan(sqrt{(t + 1)(1 - t)}) = (1/(t + 1)) arctan(sqrt{1 - t²}). So the integral becomes ∫_{-1}^1 [arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) / (t + 1)] dt. Hmm, maybe this helps? The sqrt(1 - t²) suggests a trigonometric substitution. Let t = sinθ, then sqrt(1 - t²) = cosθ, dt = cosθ dθ. Then the limits would be from θ = -π/2 to π/2. So the integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} [ arctan(cosθ) / (sinθ + 1) ] cosθ dθ. Not sure if that's better. Maybe there's a way to exploit symmetry here. The integrand is from -π/2 to π/2. Let's check if the integrand is even or odd. Let's substitute θ = -φ. Then the integrand becomes [ arctan(cos(-φ)) / (sin(-φ) + 1) ] cos(-φ) dφ = [ arctan(cosφ) / ( -sinφ + 1 ) ] cosφ dφ. Which is not the same as the original, so not even. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution. Let me think. The original integral is from 0 to 2, and the integrand has sqrt(x(2 - x)). Maybe substitution x = 2 sin²θ. Let's try that. Let x = 2 sin²θ, so dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(x(2 - x)) = sqrt(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = sqrt(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. Then arctan(2 sinθ cosθ) = arctan(sin(2θ)). The denominator x is 2 sin²θ. So the integral becomes ∫ [ arctan(sin(2θ)) / (2 sin²θ) ] * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Simplify: 4 sinθ cosθ / (2 sin²θ) = 2 cosθ / sinθ = 2 cotθ. So the integral becomes ∫ arctan(sin(2θ)) * 2 cotθ dθ. Now, the limits when x=0, sinθ=0, so θ=0. When x=2, sin²θ=1, so θ=π/2. So the integral is from θ=0 to θ=π/2. So ∫_{0}^{π/2} 2 cotθ arctan(sin(2θ)) dθ. Hmm, not sure if this is better, but maybe.

Alternatively, let's consider another substitution. Let’s set t = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then t² = x(2 - x) = 2x - x². Differentiating both sides: 2t dt = (2 - 2x) dx. So dx = (2t dt)/(2 - 2x). But x = 2 - x² + t²? Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, express x in terms of t. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that arctan(z) can be expressed as an integral. For example, arctan(z) = ∫₀^z 1/(1 + t²) dt. So maybe we can interchange the order of integration. Let me try that. The original integral is ∫₀² (1/x) arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx = ∫₀² (1/x) [ ∫₀^{sqrt(x(2 - x))} 1/(1 + t²) dt ] dx. Then switching the order of integration. Let's consider the region of integration. For x from 0 to 2, and t from 0 to sqrt(x(2 - x)). Let's sketch this region. For each x, t goes up to sqrt(x(2 - x)), which is a semicircle. Wait, t = sqrt(x(2 - x)) implies t² = x(2 - x), which is x² - 2x + t² =0. Completing the square: x² - 2x +1 = 1 - t², so (x -1)^2 + t² =1. So the region t from 0 to sqrt(x(2 - x)) is the upper half of the circle (x -1)^2 + t² =1, with t ≥0. So the original integral is over the upper half of the circle. So if we switch the order of integration, t goes from 0 to 1 (since the maximum of sqrt(x(2 -x)) is 1 at x=1). For each t, x ranges from the values where x(2 -x) ≥ t². Solving x(2 -x) ≥ t²: 2x -x² ≥ t² → x² -2x + t² ≤0. The roots of x² -2x + t² =0 are x = [2 ± sqrt(4 -4t²)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(1 - t²). So x ranges from 1 - sqrt(1 - t²) to 1 + sqrt(1 - t²). Therefore, switching the order, the integral becomes ∫_{t=0}^1 [ ∫_{x=1 - sqrt(1 - t²)}^{1 + sqrt(1 - t²)} (1/x) dx ] * (1/(1 + t²)) dt. 

So now, the inner integral is ∫ (1/x) dx from x =1 - sqrt(1 - t²) to x=1 + sqrt(1 - t²). Let's compute that. The integral of 1/x dx is ln|x|. So evaluating from lower to upper limit gives ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) - ln(1 - sqrt(1 - t²)). Let's simplify this expression. Let’s set s = sqrt(1 - t²). Then the expression becomes ln(1 + s) - ln(1 - s) = ln[(1 + s)/(1 - s)]. Now, s = sqrt(1 - t²). Let's compute (1 + s)/(1 - s). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + s): [(1 + s)^2]/(1 - s²). But 1 - s² = 1 - (1 - t²) = t². So (1 + s)/(1 - s) = (1 + s)^2 / t². Therefore, ln[(1 + s)^2 / t²] = 2 ln(1 + s) - 2 ln t. But s = sqrt(1 - t²). So 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) - 2 ln t. Therefore, the inner integral is 2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) - 2 ln t. 

Therefore, the original integral becomes ∫_{0}^1 [2 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) - 2 ln t ] / (1 + t²) dt. Let's factor out the 2: 2 ∫_{0}^1 [ ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) - ln t ] / (1 + t²) dt. 

Now, let's split the integral into two parts: 2 [ ∫_{0}^1 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) / (1 + t²) dt - ∫_{0}^1 (ln t)/(1 + t²) dt ]. 

The second integral is a standard integral. ∫_{0}^1 (ln t)/(1 + t²) dt. Let me recall that ∫_{0}^1 (ln t)/(1 + t²) dt = -G, where G is Catalan's constant. But I think it's constant is approximately 0.915965594... but maybe there's a way to express it. Alternatively, let's compute it. Let t = tanθ substitution. Let t = tanθ, dt = sec²θ dθ. When t=0, θ=0; t=1, θ=π/4. The integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/4} (ln tanθ) / (1 + tan²θ) * sec²θ dθ = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tanθ dθ. Because 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, so they cancel. So ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tanθ dθ. Let me compute this. Let’s set φ = π/2 - θ, but not sure. Alternatively, note that ln tanθ = ln sinθ - ln cosθ. So the integral becomes ∫ (ln sinθ - ln cosθ) dθ from 0 to π/4. Let's split into two integrals: ∫ ln sinθ dθ - ∫ ln cosθ dθ. The first integral from 0 to π/4 is known. The integral of ln sinθ from 0 to π/2 is - (π/2) ln 2, but here it's from 0 to π/4. Similarly, the integral of ln cosθ from 0 to π/4. Let me recall that ∫ ln sinθ dθ = - (π/2) ln 2. But for the interval 0 to π/4, perhaps we can use Fourier series or some expansion. Alternatively, use substitution. Let’s consider the integral I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tanθ dθ. Let’s substitute φ = 2θ. Then θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2. The limits become φ=0 to φ=π/2. Then I = ∫_{0}^{π/2} ln tan(φ/2) * (dφ/2). The integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{0}^{π/2} ln tan(φ/2) dφ. Let’s recall that ∫_{0}^{π/2} ln tan(φ/2) dφ = -2G, where G is Catalan's constant. Wait, I might need to verify this. Alternatively, consider expanding ln tan(φ/2) in series. But perhaps I should look for known integrals. Alternatively, use substitution. Let’s set u = φ/2, then φ=2u, dφ=2du. Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tan u * 2 du. Wait, that brings us back. Hmm. Alternatively, use the Fourier series for ln tanθ. But this might be getting too complicated. Let me check if the integral ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tanθ dθ is known. 

Alternatively, consider that ∫ ln tanθ dθ from 0 to π/4 is equal to -G, but I need to confirm. Let me check with substitution. Let’s set x = tanθ. Then θ = arctan x, dθ = dx/(1 + x²). The integral becomes x from 0 to 1. So ∫_{0}^{1} ln x / (1 + x²) dx. Wait, that's the same as the original integral we were trying to compute! So ∫_{0}^{1} (ln x)/(1 + x²) dx = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ln tanθ dθ. But we already did that substitution. So this integral is equal to -G. But I need to find its value. Let me recall that ∫_{0}^{1} (ln x)/(1 + x²) dx = -G. Yes, Catalan's constant is defined as the sum over n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n / (2n +1)^2, which is approximately 0.915965594177219... But the integral ∫_{0}^{1} (ln x)/(1 + x²) dx is indeed equal to -G. So the second integral is -G. 

So the original integral becomes 2 [ ∫_{0}^1 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) / (1 + t²) dt - (-G) ] = 2 [ ∫_{0}^1 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) / (1 + t²) dt + G ]. 

Now, we need to compute the first integral: I1 = ∫_{0}^1 ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) / (1 + t²) dt. Let's see if we can find a substitution for this. Let’s set t = sinφ. Then dt = cosφ dφ, and sqrt(1 - t²) = cosφ. The integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} ln(1 + cosφ) / (1 + sin²φ) * cosφ dφ. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe set u = sqrt(1 - t²). Let u = sqrt(1 - t²), then u² = 1 - t², so t² = 1 - u², t dt = -u du. Wait, but we have t from 0 to1, so u from 1 to 0. Let's try substitution u = sqrt(1 - t²). Then t = sqrt(1 - u²), dt = (-u)/sqrt(1 - u²) du. Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider substitution t = sinθ. Then sqrt(1 - t²) = cosθ, dt = cosθ dθ. So when t=0, θ=0; t=1, θ=π/2. Then I1 becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} ln(1 + cosθ) / (1 + sin²θ) * cosθ dθ. Hmm, still complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps expand ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) into a series. Let’s write ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) = ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)). Let’s set s = sqrt(1 - t²). Then s = sqrt(1 - t²), so s² =1 - t². Then t = sqrt(1 - s²). But not sure. Alternatively, use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + x) where x= sqrt(1 - t²). So ln(1 + sqrt(1 - t²)) = sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} (sqrt(1 - t²))^n /n. But integrating term by term might be feasible. So I1 = ∫_{0}^1 [sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} (sqrt(1 - t²))^n /n ] / (1 + t²) dt. Interchange sum and integral: sum_{n=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{n+1}/n ∫_{0}^1 (sqrt(1 - t²))^n / (1 + t²) dt ]. But this seems complicated. 

Alternatively, consider substitution t = tanh y. Let’s set t = tanh y, so dt = sech² y dy. Then 1 + t² = 1 + tanh² y = (cosh² y + sinh² y)/cosh² y = (1 + sinh² y)/cosh² y = 1/cosh² y (since cosh² y - sinh² y =1). Wait, no: 1 + tanh² y = (cosh² y + sinh² y)/cosh² y = (1 + sinh² y + sinh² y)/cosh² y = (1 + 2 sinh² y)/cosh² y. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe substitution t = sinh y or something else. 

Alternatively, let's consider a substitution that can relate to the integral involving arctan. Let’s think back to the original problem. Maybe there's a symmetry or a substitution that I missed. Let me try to consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let’s define a parameter a in the integrand and differentiate with respect to a. For example, let’s consider F(a) = ∫₀² (1/x) arctan(a sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Then F'(a) = ∫₀² (1/x) * [ sqrt(x(2 - x)) / (1 + a² x(2 - x)) ] dx. Maybe this is easier to integrate. Then integrate F'(a) from a=0 to a=1 to get F(1) - F(0). Since F(0) = ∫₀² (1/x) arctan(0) dx = 0. So F(1) = ∫₀¹ F'(a) da. 

So compute F'(a) = ∫₀² [ sqrt(x(2 - x)) / (x(1 + a² x(2 - x)) ) ] dx. Simplify the integrand: sqrt(x(2 - x)) / [x(1 + a² x(2 - x))] = sqrt(x(2 - x)) / [x(1 + a² x(2 - x))]. Let’s make substitution similar to before. Let x = 2 sin²θ, then dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Then sqrt(x(2 -x)) = 2 sinθ cosθ. The denominator becomes 2 sin²θ (1 + a² * 2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = 2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ). So the integrand becomes [2 sinθ cosθ] / [2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ)] * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Wait, let's compute step by step:

Original integrand after substitution:

sqrt(x(2 -x)) = 2 sinθ cosθ,

x = 2 sin²θ,

dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,

Denominator: x(1 + a² x(2 -x)) = 2 sin²θ (1 + a² * 2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = 2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ).

So F'(a) becomes:

[2 sinθ cosθ] / [2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ)] * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ

Simplify numerator: 2 sinθ cosθ * 4 sinθ cosθ = 8 sin²θ cos²θ

Denominator: 2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ)

So F'(a) = ∫ [8 sin²θ cos²θ / (2 sin²θ (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ))] dθ

Simplify: 8/2 = 4, sin²θ cancels, so 4 cos²θ / (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ) dθ. The limits for θ are from 0 to π/2 (since x from 0 to 2). So F'(a) = 4 ∫_{0}^{π/2} [cos²θ / (1 + 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ)] dθ.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let’s see if we can simplify the denominator. Let’s note that sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ, so sin²θ cos²θ = (1/4) sin²2θ. So 4 a² sin²θ cos²θ = a² sin²2θ. Therefore, denominator becomes 1 + a² sin²2θ. So F'(a) = 4 ∫_{0}^{π/2} [cos²θ / (1 + a² sin²2θ)] dθ. 

Let’s make substitution φ = 2θ. Then θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2. When θ=0, φ=0; θ=π/2, φ=π. So F'(a) = 4 ∫_{0}^{π} [cos²(φ/2) / (1 + a² sin²φ)] * (dφ/2) = 2 ∫_{0}^{π} [cos²(φ/2) / (1 + a² sin²φ)] dφ. 

Using the identity cos²(φ/2) = (1 + cosφ)/2. So F'(a) = 2 ∫_{0}^{π} [ (1 + cosφ)/2 ] / (1 + a² sin²φ) dφ = ∫_{0}^{π} (1 + cosφ) / (1 + a² sin²φ) dφ. 

Now, split the integral into two parts: ∫_{0}^{π} 1/(1 + a² sin²φ) dφ + ∫_{0}^{π} cosφ/(1 + a² sin²φ) dφ. 

The first integral is standard. The integral of 1/(1 + a² sin²φ) dφ over 0 to π. Let’s recall that ∫_{0}^{π} dφ / (1 + a² sin²φ) = π / sqrt(1 + a²). This is a standard integral. For example, using substitution t = tanφ, or using the formula for integrals of the form ∫ dφ / (A + B sin²φ). 

The second integral is ∫_{0}^{π} cosφ/(1 + a² sin²φ) dφ. Let’s substitute u = sinφ, then du = cosφ dφ. The limits become u=0 to u=0 (since sin0=0 and sinπ=0). Wait, but when φ goes from 0 to π, sinφ goes from 0 up to 1 and back to 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{0} [du / (1 + a² u²)] = 0. So the second integral is zero. 

Therefore, F'(a) = π / sqrt(1 + a²) + 0 = π / sqrt(1 + a²). 

Therefore, F(1) = ∫₀¹ F'(a) da = π ∫₀¹ 1 / sqrt(1 + a²) da. The integral of 1/sqrt(1 + a²) da is sinh^{-1}(a) + C. So ∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(1 + a²) da = sinh^{-1}(1) - sinh^{-1}(0) = sinh^{-1}(1) = ln(1 + sqrt(2)). Therefore, F(1) = π * ln(1 + sqrt(2)). 

So the exact value of the integral is π ln(1 + sqrt(2)). 

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. We know that π is approximately 3.1415926536, and ln(1 + sqrt(2)) is ln(2.41421356237) ≈ 0.8813735870. Multiplying these gives approximately 3.1415926536 * 0.8813735870 ≈ 2.7680738483. Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is approximately 2.7680738483. 

Let me verify this with a calculator. π ≈ 3.141592653589793. ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ ln(2.414213562373095) ≈ 0.881373587019543. Multiplying them: 3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543. Let's compute this step by step. 

First, 3 * 0.881373587019543 ≈ 2.644120761058629. Then 0.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 ≈ 0.124953087. Adding together: 2.644120761058629 + 0.124953087 ≈ 2.769073848. So approximately 2.769073848. But wait, maybe more precise calculation. Let's use more decimal places. 

Alternatively, use a calculator: 3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 = 

Let me compute this:

3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543

First, multiply 3.141592653589793 * 0.8 = 2.5132741228718344

Then 3.141592653589793 * 0.08 = 0.2513274122871835

Then 3.141592653589793 * 0.001373587019543 ≈ 3.141592653589793 * 0.001 = 0.003141592653589793, plus 3.141592653589793 * 0.000373587019543 ≈ 0.001173776. So total ≈ 0.003141592653589793 + 0.001173776 ≈ 0.004315368. 

Adding all parts: 2.5132741228718344 + 0.2513274122871835 = 2.764601535159018 + 0.004315368 ≈ 2.768916903159018. So approximately 2.76891690316. Rounded to 10 decimal places, 2.7689169032. Wait, but earlier step-by-step gave 2.769073848. Hmm, there's a discrepancy. Let me check with a calculator. 

Alternatively, using a calculator input: 3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 = 

Using a calculator: 

3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 

= 3.141592653589793 * 0.881373587019543 

Let me compute this using more precise steps. 

But perhaps I can use the fact that ln(1 + sqrt(2)) = (1/2) ln(3 + 2 sqrt(2)). Wait, but maybe not helpful. Alternatively, use known values. 

Alternatively, use a calculator for the exact multiplication. Let's use an approximate value. 

Alternatively, use the approximate value of π ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 3.1415926536 * 0.88137358702 ≈ 3.1415926536 * 0.88137358702. 

Let me compute this:

3.1415926536 * 0.88137358702 

First, multiply 3 * 0.88137358702 = 2.64412076106
