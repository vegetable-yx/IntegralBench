Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of (1/x) * arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the integral. The integrand is arctan of the square root of x times (2 - x), all divided by x. The limits are from 0 to 2. 

First, maybe I should check if there's a substitution that can simplify this expression. The square root term sqrt(x(2 - x)) looks like part of a circle equation. If I let x = 2 sin²θ, maybe that would help? Let me try that substitution. 

Wait, if x = 2 sin²θ, then dx would be 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let's see what the square root becomes. sqrt(x(2 - x)) = sqrt(2 sin²θ * (2 - 2 sin²θ)) = sqrt(2 sin²θ * 2 cos²θ) = sqrt(4 sin²θ cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. So the arctan argument becomes 2 sinθ cosθ. But arctan(2 sinθ cosθ) is arctan(sin(2θ)), since sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ. 

So substituting back into the integral, the integrand becomes arctan(sin(2θ)) divided by x, which is 2 sin²θ, multiplied by dx, which is 4 sinθ cosθ dθ. Let me write that out:

Integral from θ=0 to θ=π/2 (since x goes from 0 to 2, when x=0, sinθ=0, θ=0; x=2, sinθ=1, θ=π/2) of [arctan(sin(2θ)) / (2 sin²θ)] * 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Simplify the constants and terms: 4/(2) = 2, so 2 * [arctan(sin(2θ)) / sin²θ] * sinθ cosθ dθ. That simplifies to 2 arctan(sin(2θ)) * cosθ / sinθ dθ. Which is 2 arctan(sin(2θ)) * cotθ dθ. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let me consider integrating by parts with u = arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) and dv = dx/x. Wait, but dv is dx/x, so v would be ln|x|. But integrating by parts might complicate things. Let me try:

Let u = arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))), dv = dx/x. Then du = derivative of arctan(y) where y = sqrt(x(2 - x)). The derivative of arctan(y) is (y')/(1 + y²). Let's compute y':

y = sqrt(x(2 - x)) = [x(2 - x)]^(1/2). So dy/dx = (1/2)[x(2 - x)]^(-1/2) * (2 - 2x). Which simplifies to (2 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(x(2 - x))) = (1 - x)/sqrt(x(2 - x)). Therefore, du = [ (1 - x)/sqrt(x(2 - x)) ] / (1 + x(2 - x)) dx. Wait, 1 + y² is 1 + x(2 - x) = 1 + 2x - x². So du = (1 - x)/[sqrt(x(2 - x))(1 + 2x - x²)] dx. 

Then, integrating by parts gives uv| from 0 to 2 minus integral of v du. So uv would be arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) * ln x evaluated from 0 to 2. But at x=0, ln x goes to -infinity, but arctan(sqrt(0)) is 0, so maybe the limit is 0. At x=2, similar: arctan(sqrt(0)) is 0, so uv term might be 0. But I need to check the limits exist. Hmm, this might be tricky. The integral becomes - integral from 0 to 2 of ln x * [ (1 - x) / (sqrt(x(2 - x))(1 + 2x - x²)) ] dx. That seems more complicated than the original integral. Maybe integration by parts isn't the way to go.

Let me go back to the substitution idea. Maybe another substitution. Let me consider t = x - 1. Then x = t + 1, and the integral becomes from t = -1 to t = 1. The term x(2 - x) becomes (t + 1)(1 - t) = 1 - t². So sqrt(x(2 - x)) becomes sqrt(1 - t²). Then the integrand is arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) divided by (t + 1). Hmm, but the substitution might not help much here. Let me see:

dx = dt, so the integral becomes ∫ from t=-1 to t=1 of [ arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) / (t + 1) ] dt. Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe symmetry? The integrand might have some symmetry around t=0. Let me check if it's even or odd. If t replaced by -t, then the integrand becomes arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) / (-t + 1). Not sure. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution u = 2 - x. Then when x goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 2 to 0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=2 to u=0 of (1/(2 - u)) arctan(sqrt((2 - u)u)) (-du). Which is ∫ from 0 to 2 of [1/(2 - u)] arctan(sqrt(u(2 - u))) du. So the integral is the same as the original, which suggests that the integral from 0 to 2 of [1/x + 1/(2 - x)] arctan(...) dx is twice the original integral. Wait, but adding the original integral and the substitution gives:

Original integral: ∫0^2 (1/x) arctan(...) dx

After substitution u=2 - x: ∫0^2 [1/(2 - u)] arctan(...) du

So adding them: ∫0^2 [1/x + 1/(2 - x)] arctan(...) dx = 2I

But [1/x + 1/(2 - x)] = (2 - x + x)/(x(2 - x)) = 2/(x(2 - x)). So 2I = ∫0^2 [2/(x(2 - x))] arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Therefore, I = ∫0^2 [1/(x(2 - x))] arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, but this seems to complicate the integrand. Maybe not helpful.

Wait, but perhaps another substitution here. Let me set y = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then y² = x(2 - x). Let's see if we can express x in terms of y. But that's a quadratic. Alternatively, maybe set t = sqrt(x(2 - x)). Then t = sqrt(2x - x²). Let's compute dt/dx: (2 - 2x)/(2 sqrt(2x - x²)) = (1 - x)/t. Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign. Let me think. Suppose we consider a parameter in the integrand. For example, maybe introduce a parameter a into the arctan function. Let’s define I(a) = ∫0^2 (1/x) arctan(a sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Then, differentiate I(a) with respect to a. The derivative I’(a) would be ∫0^2 (1/x) * [ sqrt(x(2 - x)) / (1 + a² x(2 - x)) ] dx. Simplify that:

I’(a) = ∫0^2 sqrt(x(2 - x)) / [x(1 + a² x(2 - x))] dx = ∫0^2 sqrt(x(2 - x)) / [x(1 + a² x(2 - x))] dx.

Simplify sqrt(x(2 - x))/x = sqrt((2 - x)/x). So I’(a) = ∫0^2 sqrt((2 - x)/x) / (1 + a² x(2 - x)) dx. Let me make substitution t = sqrt((2 - x)/x). Let’s see:

Let t = sqrt((2 - x)/x). Then t² = (2 - x)/x => t² x = 2 - x => x(t² + 1) = 2 => x = 2/(t² + 1). Then dx/dt = -4t/(t² + 1)^2. The limits: when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity; when x=2, t=0. So the integral becomes from t=∞ to t=0. Let's reverse the limits and change the sign:

I’(a) = ∫0^∞ t / [1 + a² * (2/(t² + 1)) * (2 - 2/(t² + 1)) ] * (-dx/dt) dt. Wait, let's compute the denominator:

The denominator in the integrand is 1 + a² x(2 - x). Since x = 2/(t² + 1), then 2 - x = 2 - 2/(t² + 1) = 2(t² + 1 - 1)/(t² + 1) = 2 t²/(t² + 1). Therefore, x(2 - x) = [2/(t² + 1)] * [2 t²/(t² + 1)] = 4 t²/(t² + 1)^2. So the denominator becomes 1 + a² * 4 t²/(t² + 1)^2. 

Putting it all together, I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [ t / (1 + (4 a² t²)/(t² + 1)^2) ] * [4 t/(t² + 1)^2] dt. Wait, let's check:

Original integrand after substitution:

sqrt((2 - x)/x) = t, and dx is -4t/(t² + 1)^2 dt. So the integral becomes:

I’(a) = ∫_{∞}^{0} [ t / (1 + a² x(2 - x)) ] * (-4t/(t² + 1)^2) dt = ∫0^∞ [ t / (1 + (4 a² t²)/(t² + 1)^2) ] * (4 t/(t² + 1)^2) dt.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator: t * 4 t / (t² + 1)^2 = 4 t² / (t² + 1)^2.

Denominator: 1 + (4 a² t²)/(t² + 1)^2 = [ (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² ] / (t² + 1)^2.

Therefore, the integrand becomes [4 t² / (t² + 1)^2] / [ (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² ) / (t² + 1)^2 ) ] = 4 t² / [ (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² ].

So I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 t² / ( (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² ) ] dt.

Hmm, this integral might be manageable. Let's try to simplify the denominator:

(t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² = t^4 + 2 t² + 1 + 4 a² t² = t^4 + (2 + 4 a²) t² + 1.

Let me see if this can be factored. Let’s set u = t². Then denominator becomes u² + (2 + 4 a²) u + 1. Let's check discriminant for quadratic in u: (2 + 4 a²)^2 - 4*1*1 = 4 + 16 a² + 16 a^4 - 4 = 16 a² + 16 a^4 = 16 a²(1 + a²). So roots are u = [ - (2 + 4 a²) ± sqrt(16 a²(1 + a²)) ] / 2. Which is [ -2(1 + 2 a²) ± 4 a sqrt(1 + a²) ] / 2 = - (1 + 2 a²) ± 2 a sqrt(1 + a²). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe partial fractions? Alternatively, maybe substitution.

Alternatively, note that the denominator can be written as t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1. Let me see if this is a perfect square. Suppose (t² + b t + c)^2 = t^4 + 2 b t^3 + (b² + 2 c) t² + 2 b c t + c². Not matching. Alternatively, maybe t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1 = (t² + m)^2 + n. Let me check: t^4 + 2 m t² + m² + n. Comparing coefficients: 2 m = 2(1 + 2 a²) => m = 1 + 2 a². Then m² + n = 1 => n = 1 - (1 + 2 a²)^2. Which is negative. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use substitution z = t - 1/t or something. Let me think. Let’s try substitution z = t - 1/t. Then dz/dt = 1 + 1/t². Not sure. Alternatively, let me consider integrating over t from 0 to infinity. Maybe use substitution t = tan φ. Let’s try t = tan φ, where φ goes from 0 to π/2. Then dt = sec² φ dφ. Let's see:

Denominator becomes tan^4 φ + 2(1 + 2 a²) tan² φ + 1. Let's express in terms of sin and cos:

tan^4 φ + 2(1 + 2 a²) tan² φ + 1 = (sin^4 φ / cos^4 φ) + 2(1 + 2 a²)(sin² φ / cos² φ) + 1. Hmm, not sure. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that the integrand is even in t? Wait, t is from 0 to infinity, so maybe not. Alternatively, consider substitution s = t². Then ds = 2 t dt, so t dt = ds/2. Then the integral becomes:

I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 s / ( (s + 1)^2 + 4 a² s ) ] * (1/(2 sqrt(s))) ds. Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Original integral I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 t² / ( (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t² ) ] dt.

Let s = t², so t = sqrt(s), dt = (1/(2 sqrt(s))) ds. Then:

I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 s / ( (s + 1)^2 + 4 a² s ) ] * (1/(2 sqrt(s))) ds = 2 ∫0^∞ [sqrt(s) / ( (s + 1)^2 + 4 a² s ) ] ds.

Hmm, not sure. Let me expand the denominator:

(s + 1)^2 + 4 a² s = s² + 2 s + 1 + 4 a² s = s² + (2 + 4 a²) s + 1. So the integral becomes 2 ∫0^∞ sqrt(s) / (s² + (2 + 4 a²) s + 1) ds. Still not obvious. Maybe use substitution u = s + c for some c. Alternatively, partial fractions. But integrating sqrt(s) over a quartic denominator is complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, consider that the integral is symmetric in some way. Let me check if substitution s = 1/u. Let s = 1/u, then when s goes from 0 to ∞, u goes from ∞ to 0. Then ds = -1/u² du. The integral becomes 2 ∫∞^0 sqrt(1/u) / ( (1/u)^2 + (2 + 4 a²)(1/u) + 1 ) * (-1/u²) du = 2 ∫0^∞ (1/sqrt(u)) / ( (1 + (2 + 4 a²) u + u² ) / u² ) * (1/u²) du = 2 ∫0^∞ (1/sqrt(u)) * u² / (1 + (2 + 4 a²) u + u² ) * (1/u²) du = 2 ∫0^∞ 1/(sqrt(u) (1 + (2 + 4 a²) u + u² )) du. Which is the same as the integral we started with, but in terms of u. So it's symmetric. Therefore, maybe adding the original integral and the substitution gives something. Let me denote the integral as J = ∫0^∞ sqrt(s)/(s² + (2 + 4 a²)s + 1) ds. Then after substitution s = 1/u, J becomes ∫0^∞ sqrt(1/u)/( (1/u²) + (2 + 4 a²)(1/u) + 1 ) * (1/u²) du. Wait, this seems similar but not exactly the same. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use contour integration. But that might be too advanced. Alternatively, look up integral tables. Let me recall that integrals of the form ∫0^∞ t² / (t^4 + bt² + 1) dt can sometimes be evaluated using substitution or partial fractions. Let me check the denominator: t^4 + (2 + 4 a²) t² + 1. Let me factor this as t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1. Let me set it as (t² + p t + 1)(t² - p t + 1) = t^4 + (2 - p²) t² + 1. Comparing coefficients: 2 - p² = 2 + 4 a² => p² = -4 a². Which is imaginary. Not helpful. So maybe not factorable over real numbers.

Alternatively, complete the square in the denominator. Let me write t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1 = (t² + (1 + 2 a²))² - ( (1 + 2 a²)^2 - 1 ). Compute (1 + 2 a²)^2 - 1 = 1 + 4 a² + 4 a^4 -1 = 4 a² + 4 a^4 = 4 a²(1 + a²). So denominator becomes (t² + 1 + 2 a²)^2 - (2 a sqrt(1 + a²))^2. Which is a difference of squares, so factors as [t² + 1 + 2 a² + 2 a sqrt(1 + a²)][t² + 1 + 2 a² - 2 a sqrt(1 + a²)]. Hmm, but this might not help in partial fractions.

Alternatively, use substitution z = t^2. Then the integral becomes ∫0^∞ [4 z / (z^2 + 2(1 + 2 a²) z + 1)] * (1/(2 sqrt(z))) dz. Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Original I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 t² / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) ] dt. Let z = t², so t = sqrt(z), dt = dz/(2 sqrt(z)). Then:

I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 z / (z² + 2(1 + 2 a²) z + 1) ] * (1/(2 sqrt(z))) dz = 2 ∫0^∞ [ z^{1/2} / (z² + 2(1 + 2 a²) z + 1) ] dz.

This is similar to a Mellin transform. Maybe use substitution y = z. Not sure. Alternatively, look up integral tables. For example, integral from 0 to infinity of x^{λ -1} / (x² + 2 b x + 1) dx. There might be a formula for this. Let me recall that ∫0^∞ x^{c-1}/(x² + 2 b x + 1) dx can be expressed in terms of beta functions or gamma functions. Alternatively, use substitution x = tan θ. Let me try:

Let x = tan θ, then dx = sec² θ dθ. The integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} tan^{c-1} θ / (tan² θ + 2 b tan θ + 1) * sec² θ dθ. Simplify denominator: tan² θ + 2 b tan θ + 1 = sec² θ + 2 b tan θ - 1 +1 = sec² θ + 2 b tan θ. Not helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, write the denominator as (x + b)^2 + (1 - b²). If 1 - b² > 0, then it's a sum of squares. Let me check: x² + 2 b x + 1 = (x + b)^2 + (1 - b²). So if 1 - b² is positive, then we can write it as (x + b)^2 + (sqrt(1 - b²))^2. Then the integral becomes ∫0^∞ x^{c-1} / [ (x + b)^2 + (sqrt(1 - b²))^2 ] dx. But I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, use partial fractions. Let me consider the denominator factors as (x + p)(x + q)(x + r)(x + s). But since it's a quartic, maybe it's a product of two quadratics. Earlier attempt showed that it's not factorable over real numbers unless a is specific. So maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider specific values of a. Since the original integral is for a=1.0. Wait, in the original problem, the integrand is arctan(1.0 sqrt(x(2 - x))). So a=1.0. So maybe compute I’(1) and then integrate over a from 0 to 1. Wait, but the original problem is to compute I(1). So maybe if I can find I’(a) in terms of a, then integrate from 0 to 1 to get I(1) - I(0). But I(0) is the integral of arctan(0)/x from 0 to 2, which is 0. So I(1) = ∫0^1 I’(a) da. 

So if I can compute I’(a) and then integrate over a from 0 to 1, that would give the original integral. But I need to find an expression for I’(a). Let me see if I can compute the integral I’(a) = ∫0^∞ [4 t² / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) ] dt. 

Let me try substitution t = 1. Let me consider t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1 = t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1. Let me divide numerator and denominator by t²: [4 t²] / [t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1] = 4 / [t² + 2(1 + 2 a²) + 1/t²]. Let me set u = t - 1/t. Then u² = t² - 2 + 1/t². So t² + 1/t² = u² + 2. Then the denominator becomes u² + 2 + 2(1 + 2 a²) = u² + 2 + 2 + 4 a² = u² + 4(1 + a²). So the integrand becomes 4 / (u² + 4(1 + a²)). But when we make substitution u = t - 1/t, du = (1 + 1/t²) dt. Hmm, but the integral is from t=0 to t=∞. Let's see:

When t goes from 0 to ∞, u = t - 1/t goes from -∞ to ∞. So the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^∞ [4 / (u² + 4(1 + a²)) ] * [dt / (1 + 1/t²)]. Wait, this seems complicated. Let me check:

From u = t - 1/t, solving for t in terms of u might be difficult. Alternatively, note that the substitution u = t + 1/t is often used for integrals involving t^2 + 1/t^2, but here we have t^2 + 1/t^2 = (t - 1/t)^2 + 2. Wait, but in our case, the denominator is t^2 + 1/t^2 + 2(1 + 2 a²). Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, since the integrand is even in u (since denominator is u² + ...), maybe the integral from -infty to infty is twice the integral from 0 to infty. But I need to relate du to dt. Let me compute du = (1 + 1/t²) dt. So dt = du / (1 + 1/t²) = t² du / (t² + 1). But t is expressed in terms of u, which complicates things. 

Alternatively, note that when t approaches 0, u approaches -infty, and as t approaches infty, u approaches infty. So the substitution covers the entire real line. But integrating over u would require expressing t in terms of u, which is not straightforward. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral over t from 0 to ∞ can be split into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to ∞. Then, in the second part, substitute t = 1/s. Let me try:

I’(a) = ∫0^1 [4 t² / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) ] dt + ∫1^∞ [4 t² / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) ] dt.

In the second integral, substitute t = 1/s, so dt = -1/s² ds, limits from s=1 to s=0:

= ∫0^1 [4 t² / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) ] dt + ∫0^1 [4 (1/s²) / (1/s^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²)(1/s²) + 1) ] * (1/s²) ds.

Simplify the second integral:

4 (1/s²) / [ (1 + 2(1 + 2 a²) s² + s^4 ) / s^4 ] * (1/s²) ds = 4 s² / (s^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) s² + 1) * (1/s²) ds = 4 / (s^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) s² + 1) ds.

So the second integral becomes ∫0^1 [4 / (s^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) s² + 1) ] ds. Therefore, combining both integrals:

I’(a) = ∫0^1 [4 t² + 4 ] / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) dt. 

Factor numerator: 4(t² + 1). So:

I’(a) = 4 ∫0^1 (t² + 1) / (t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1) dt.

Let me check the denominator: t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1. Let me write it as t^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) t² + 1. The numerator is t² + 1. Maybe we can write the denominator as (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t². Let's see:

(t² + 1)^2 = t^4 + 2 t² + 1. So denominator is (t² + 1)^2 + 4 a² t². So:

I’(a) = 4 ∫0^1 (t² + 1) / [ (t² + 1)^2 + (2 a t)^2 ] dt.

This looks like something that can be expressed in terms of arctan. Let me set y = t. Then, the integrand becomes (y² + 1) / [ (y² + 1)^2 + (2 a y)^2 ].

Let me factor the denominator:

(y² + 1)^2 + (2 a y)^2 = y^4 + 2 y² + 1 + 4 a² y² = y^4 + (2 + 4 a²) y² + 1. Which is the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, note that (y² + 1)^2 + (2 a y)^2 = (y² + 1 + 2 a y i)(y² + 1 - 2 a y i). But complex factors might not help here.

Alternatively, make substitution z = y - (something). Let me try substitution z = y + k/y. Not sure. Alternatively, note that the integrand is (y² + 1) / (y^4 + 2(1 + 2 a²) y² + 1). Let me divide numerator and denominator by y²:

= (1 + 1/y²) / (y² + 2(1 + 2 a²) + 1/y²). Let me set u = y - 1/y. Then u² = y² - 2 + 1/y². So y² + 1/y² = u² + 2. Then denominator becomes u² + 2 + 2(1 + 2 a²) = u² + 4(1 + a²). The numerator is 1 + 1/y² = (y² + 1)/y². Hmm, but not sure. 

Alternatively, the integrand becomes (1 + 1/y²) / ( (y - 1/y)^2 + 4(1 + a²) ). Let me set u = y - 1/y. Then du = (1 + 1/y²) dy. So the integral becomes:

∫ [ (1 + 1/y²) dy ] / (u² + 4(1 + a²)) = ∫ du / (u² + 4(1 + a²)).

But the limits of integration change. When y goes from 0 to 1, u = y - 1/y goes from -infty to 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 du / (u² + 4(1 + a²)) = [ (1/(2 sqrt(1 + a²))) arctan(u/(2 sqrt(1 + a²))) ] from -infty to 0. Which evaluates to (1/(2 sqrt(1 + a²))) [0 - (-π/2)] = π/(4 sqrt(1 + a²)).

Therefore, I’(a) = 4 * π/(4 sqrt(1 + a²)) = π / sqrt(1 + a²).

Wow, that's a breakthrough! So I’(a) = π / sqrt(1 + a²). Therefore, since I(a) = ∫0^a I’(k) dk + I(0). But I(0) = 0, as arctan(0) is 0. Therefore, I(a) = ∫0^a π / sqrt(1 + k²) dk. 

Integrate π / sqrt(1 + k²) dk from 0 to a. The integral of 1/sqrt(1 + k²) dk is sinh^{-1}(k) + C, or ln(k + sqrt(k² + 1)). So:

I(a) = π [ ln(k + sqrt(k² + 1)) ] from 0 to a = π [ ln(a + sqrt(a² + 1)) - ln(0 + sqrt(0 + 1)) ] = π [ ln(a + sqrt(a² + 1)) - 0 ] = π ln(a + sqrt(a² + 1)).

Therefore, the original integral I(1) is π ln(1 + sqrt(2)). 

So the exact answer is π times the natural logarithm of 1 plus sqrt(2). 

Now, for the numerical approximation. Compute ln(1 + sqrt(2)). Let's compute sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356237. Then 1 + sqrt(2) ≈ 2.41421356237. The natural log of that: ln(2.41421356237). Let me compute that. 

ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718056, ln(3) ≈ 1.09861228866. Since 2.4142 is between e^0.88 and e^0.89. Let me compute e^0.88: e^0.8 = 2.2255, e^0.88 ≈ 2.4095. Close to 2.4142. So ln(2.4142) ≈ 0.88 + (2.4142 - 2.4095)/(2.4142 - 2.4095) * (0.89 - 0.88). Wait, better to use calculator:

ln(2.41421356237) ≈ 0.88137358702. Then multiply by π ≈ 3.1415926535. So 0.88137358702 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 2.7686592833. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 2.7686592833. Let me verify with a calculator:
