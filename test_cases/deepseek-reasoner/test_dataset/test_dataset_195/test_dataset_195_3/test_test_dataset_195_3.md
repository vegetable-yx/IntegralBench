Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of arcsin(x) times arccos(x) from 0 to 1. Hmm, let's start by recalling some integration techniques. Since this is a product of two inverse trigonometric functions, maybe integration by parts would work here. 

First, I should note that arcsin(x) and arccos(x) are related. I remember that arcsin(x) + arccos(x) = π/2. Maybe that identity can help simplify the problem somehow. Let me think. If I let one of them be expressed in terms of the other, maybe substitution would work. But I'm not sure yet. Let's try integration by parts first.

Integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. So I need to choose u and dv. Let's try setting u = arcsin(x) and dv = arccos(x) dx. Then du would be 1/√(1 - x²) dx, and I need to find v by integrating dv. Wait, integrating arccos(x) dx. Let me recall: the integral of arccos(x) dx is x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²) + C. Let me check that derivative. If I take d/dx [x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²)], that's arccos(x) + x*(-1/√(1 - x²)) - (1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x). Simplifying, arccos(x) - x/√(1 - x²) + x/√(1 - x²) = arccos(x). Yes, that's correct. So v = x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²).

So applying integration by parts: uv - ∫v du. So that's [arcsin(x)(x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²))] from 0 to 1 minus the integral from 0 to 1 of (x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²)) * (1/√(1 - x²)) dx.

Let me compute the boundary terms first. At x=1: arcsin(1) is π/2, arccos(1) is 0. So the first term becomes π/2 * (1*0 - √(1 - 1)) = π/2 * (0 - 0) = 0. At x=0: arcsin(0) is 0, arccos(0) is π/2. So the term is 0*(0*π/2 - √(1 - 0)) = 0. So the entire boundary term is 0 - 0 = 0. So the integral reduces to -∫ from 0 to1 of [x arccos(x) - √(1 - x²)] / √(1 - x²) dx.

Let me split that integral into two parts: - [∫ x arccos(x)/√(1 - x²) dx - ∫ √(1 - x²)/√(1 - x²) dx] from 0 to1. Simplifying the second integral: √(1 - x²)/√(1 - x²) is 1, so ∫1 dx from 0 to1 is 1. So the integral becomes - [∫ x arccos(x)/√(1 - x²) dx - 1]. Which is -∫ x arccos(x)/√(1 - x²) dx + 1.

Now, the remaining integral is ∫ x arccos(x)/√(1 - x²) dx from 0 to1. Let me see if I can simplify this. Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set t = arccos(x). Then x = cos(t), and when x=0, t=π/2; when x=1, t=0. Also, dx = -sin(t) dt. Let's substitute. The integral becomes ∫ (cos(t) * t) / √(1 - cos²(t)) * (-sin(t) dt) from t=π/2 to t=0. Let's reverse the limits to get rid of the negative sign: ∫ from 0 to π/2 of [cos(t) * t / sin(t)] * sin(t) dt. Because √(1 - cos²t) is sin(t), and since t is between 0 and π/2, sin(t) is positive. So the denominator is sin(t), multiplied by sin(t) from dx. So the sin(t) cancels out. So we have ∫ from 0 to π/2 of t cos(t) dt.

That's simpler. So the integral becomes ∫0^{π/2} t cos(t) dt. Let's compute this. Integration by parts again. Let u = t, dv = cos(t) dt. Then du = dt, v = sin(t). So uv - ∫v du = t sin(t) - ∫ sin(t) dt from 0 to π/2. The integral of sin(t) is -cos(t). So evaluating from 0 to π/2: [t sin(t) + cos(t)] from 0 to π/2.

At π/2: π/2 * 1 + 0 = π/2. At 0: 0*0 + 1 = 1. So the integral is (π/2 - 1) - (0 +1) = π/2 - 1 -1 = π/2 - 2. Wait, no: [π/2 *1 + 0] - [0 +1] = π/2 -1. Wait, let me check again. The integral is [t sin(t) + cos(t)] from 0 to π/2. At upper limit: (π/2 * 1) + cos(π/2) = π/2 + 0. At lower limit: 0*0 + cos(0) = 1. So the integral is (π/2 + 0) - (0 +1) = π/2 -1. So the integral ∫0^{π/2} t cos(t) dt = π/2 -1.

So going back, the original remaining integral was equal to π/2 -1. Therefore, the entire expression we had earlier was - (π/2 -1) +1. Let's compute that: -π/2 +1 +1 = -π/2 +2. So the integral ∫0^1 arcsin(x) arccos(x) dx = 2 - π/2.

Wait, let me verify that again. The original integral was equal to - [∫ x arccos(x)/√(1 -x²) dx -1] = - (π/2 -1) +1 = -π/2 +1 +1 = 2 - π/2. Yes, that's correct.

So the exact answer is 2 - π/2. Let me check if that makes sense. π is approximately 3.1416, so π/2 is about 1.5708. Then 2 -1.5708 ≈ 0.4292. Let me compute the numerical approximation. Let's compute 2 - π/2. π ≈ 3.1415926536, so π/2 ≈ 1.5707963268. Then 2 -1.5707963268 ≈ 0.4292036732. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 0.4292036732.

Wait, but let me confirm this result by another method to be sure. Alternatively, since arcsin(x) + arccos(x) = π/2, maybe we can express one in terms of the other. Let me try substitution. Let’s set θ = arcsin(x). Then x = sinθ, and arccos(x) = arccos(sinθ). But arccos(sinθ) can be expressed as π/2 - θ when θ is in [0, π/2], which it is here since x is between 0 and1. Wait, arccos(sinθ) = π/2 - θ? Let me check for θ = 0: sinθ=0, arccos(0)=π/2, which is π/2 -0. For θ=π/2: sinθ=1, arccos(1)=0= π/2 -π/2. So yes, arccos(sinθ)=π/2 -θ. Therefore, arccos(x) = π/2 - arcsin(x). So the original integral becomes ∫0^1 arcsin(x) (π/2 - arcsin(x)) dx. Which is π/2 ∫0^1 arcsin(x) dx - ∫0^1 (arcsin(x))^2 dx.

Let me compute these two integrals separately. First, ∫ arcsin(x) dx. Let me recall that the integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + √(1 -x²) + C. So evaluated from 0 to1: [1*π/2 +0] - [0 +1] = π/2 -1. So the first term is π/2*(π/2 -1) = (π²)/4 - π/2.

Now the second integral: ∫0^1 (arcsin(x))^2 dx. Hmm, integrating (arcsin(x))^2. Let me use integration by parts. Let u = (arcsin(x))^2, dv = dx. Then du = 2 arcsin(x) * (1/√(1 -x²)) dx, and v =x. So uv - ∫v du = x (arcsin(x))^2 - ∫ x * 2 arcsin(x)/√(1 -x²) dx. Let me compute this. The remaining integral is 2 ∫ x arcsin(x)/√(1 -x²) dx. Wait, this seems similar to the integral we had earlier. Let me make substitution here. Let t = arcsin(x). Then x = sin t, dx = cos t dt, and √(1 -x²) = cos t. So the integral becomes 2 ∫ sin t * t / cos t * cos t dt = 2 ∫ t sin t dt. Which is 2 times the integral of t sin t dt. Integration by parts: let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So uv - ∫v du = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C. Evaluated from t=0 to t=π/2. So at π/2: - (π/2)*0 +1 =1. At 0: -0*1 +0=0. So the integral is 2*(1 -0) =2. Therefore, the integral ∫0^1 (arcsin(x))^2 dx = x (arcsin(x))^2 evaluated from 0 to1 - 2. At x=1: 1*(π/2)^2. At x=0:0. So it's (π²/4) -2. 

So putting it all together, the original integral is π/2*(π/2 -1) - (π²/4 -2) = (π²/4 - π/2) - π²/4 +2 = -π/2 +2. Which is the same result as before: 2 - π/2. So that confirms the answer. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 2 - π/2. Numerically, as calculated earlier, that's approximately 0.4292036732. Rounded to 10 decimal places, 0.4292036732. Let me check with a calculator precision. π is approximately 3.141592653589793. So π/2 is 1.5707963267948966. Then 2 -1.5707963267948966 = 0.4292036732051034. So rounded to 10 decimal places, 0.4292036732.

So the final answer is 2 - π/2, which in LaTeX is 2 - \frac{\pi}{2}, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.4292036732.
