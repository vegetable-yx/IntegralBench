Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of 1/(3^x + 1) from -1 to 1. Hmm, I remember that sometimes with integrals involving exponentials in the denominator, substitution might help. Let me think.

First, maybe I can simplify the integrand. The function is 1/(3^x + 1). Let me consider substitution. Let’s set u = -x. Then when x = -1, u = 1, and when x = 1, u = -1. But swapping the limits would change the integral's sign. Wait, maybe that's useful. Let me try substituting u = -x. Then du = -dx, so dx = -du. The integral becomes from u=1 to u=-1 of 1/(3^{-u} + 1) * (-du). Flipping the limits, it becomes integral from u=-1 to u=1 of 1/(3^{-u} + 1) du. But 3^{-u} is the same as (1/3)^u. So the integrand is 1/( (1/3)^u + 1 ). Let me write that as 1/(3^{-u} + 1). Hmm, maybe adding the original integral and this transformed one could help. Let me denote the original integral as I. So I = ∫_{-1}^1 1/(3^x +1) dx. Then after substitution, the transformed integral is ∫_{-1}^1 1/(3^{-x} +1) dx. If I add them together, I + I_transformed = ∫_{-1}^1 [1/(3^x +1) + 1/(3^{-x} +1)] dx. Let me compute the sum inside the integral. Let's combine the fractions. The denominators are 3^x +1 and 3^{-x} +1. Let me write 3^{-x} as 1/3^x. So the second term is 1/(1/3^x +1) = 3^x/(1 + 3^x). Therefore, adding the two terms: [1/(3^x +1)] + [3^x/(3^x +1)] = (1 + 3^x)/(3^x +1) = 1. So the sum of the integrals is ∫_{-1}^1 1 dx = 2. Therefore, I + I_transformed = 2. But wait, what is I_transformed? Let me check. The transformed integral after substitution u = -x is ∫_{-1}^1 1/(3^{-x} +1) dx, which is the same as I_transformed. But notice that if we let x be replaced by -x, the integrand becomes 1/(3^{-x} +1). But in the original integral, the integrand is 1/(3^x +1). So I_transformed is ∫_{-1}^1 1/(3^{-x} +1) dx. But from the substitution, we saw that this is equal to the original integral I? Wait, no. Wait, when we did substitution u = -x, the transformed integral became ∫_{-1}^1 1/(3^{-x} +1) dx. But how is that related to I? Let me see. Let me compute I_transformed. Let me write 1/(3^{-x} +1) = 3^x/(1 + 3^x). So I_transformed = ∫_{-1}^1 3^x/(3^x +1) dx. Therefore, I + I_transformed = ∫_{-1}^1 [1/(3^x +1) + 3^x/(3^x +1)] dx = ∫_{-1}^1 1 dx = 2. But I_transformed is ∫ 3^x/(3^x +1) dx. Let me see if I can relate this to I. Let me note that 3^x/(3^x +1) = 1 - 1/(3^x +1). Therefore, I_transformed = ∫_{-1}^1 [1 - 1/(3^x +1)] dx = ∫_{-1}^1 1 dx - I = 2 - I. Therefore, substituting back into the equation I + I_transformed = 2, we have I + (2 - I) = 2. Wait, that's 2 = 2. Hmm, that's a tautology. That approach might not help. Maybe I need another substitution. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t = 3^x. Let me try that. Let t = 3^x. Then dt/dx = 3^x ln 3, so dx = dt/(t ln 3). When x = -1, t = 3^{-1} = 1/3. When x = 1, t = 3^1 = 3. So the integral becomes ∫_{1/3}^3 [1/(t +1)] * [1/(t ln 3)] dt. So that's (1/ln 3) ∫_{1/3}^3 1/(t(t +1)) dt. Hmm, maybe partial fractions here. Let's decompose 1/(t(t +1)) into A/t + B/(t +1). Solving for A and B: 1 = A(t +1) + Bt. Let t = -1: 1 = A(0) + B(-1) => B = -1. Let t = 0: 1 = A(1) + B(0) => A = 1. Therefore, 1/(t(t +1)) = 1/t - 1/(t +1). Therefore, the integral becomes (1/ln 3) [ ∫_{1/3}^3 (1/t - 1/(t +1)) dt ] = (1/ln 3)[ ln|t| - ln|t +1| ] from 1/3 to 3. Compute the definite integral: [ln(3) - ln(4)] - [ln(1/3) - ln(1/3 +1)]. Let's compute each term. First, upper limit t=3: ln(3) - ln(4). Lower limit t=1/3: ln(1/3) - ln(1/3 +1) = ln(1/3) - ln(4/3). So the difference is [ln(3) - ln(4)] - [ln(1/3) - ln(4/3)] = ln(3) - ln(4) - ln(1/3) + ln(4/3). Simplify term by term. ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so -ln(1/3) is ln(3). Similarly, ln(4/3) is ln(4) - ln(3). So substituting back: ln(3) - ln(4) + ln(3) + ln(4) - ln(3) = ln(3) - ln(4) + ln(3) + ln(4) - ln(3) = ln(3). Therefore, the entire integral is (1/ln 3) * ln(3) = 1. Wait, that's interesting. So the integral from -1 to 1 of 1/(3^x +1) dx equals 1? Let me check that again. Let me verify the steps. Starting with substitution t=3^x, then the integral becomes (1/ln 3) times [ln(t) - ln(t+1)] from 1/3 to 3. Then upper limit: ln(3) - ln(4). Lower limit: ln(1/3) - ln(4/3). The difference is [ln(3) - ln(4)] - [ln(1/3) - ln(4/3)] = ln(3) - ln(4) - ln(1/3) + ln(4/3). Now, ln(1/3) = -ln(3), so -ln(1/3) = ln(3). Similarly, ln(4/3) = ln(4) - ln(3). So substituting: ln(3) - ln(4) + ln(3) + ln(4) - ln(3) = ln(3). Then multiply by 1/ln(3), gives 1. So the exact answer is 1. Wait, that's surprising. Let me check with numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically. The function is 1/(3^x +1). Let's approximate the integral from -1 to 1. Let's split into two intervals maybe. But perhaps using a simple method. Let me take x from -1 to 1. Let's compute at x=-1: 1/(3^{-1} +1) = 1/(1/3 +1) = 1/(4/3) = 3/4 = 0.75. At x=0: 1/(1 +1) = 0.5. At x=1: 1/(3 +1) = 0.25. Using the trapezoidal rule with two intervals: h=(1 - (-1))/2 = 1. The formula is h/2 [f(-1) + 2f(0) + f(1)] = 1/2 [0.75 + 2*0.5 + 0.25] = 1/2 [0.75 +1 +0.25] = 1/2 * 2 = 1. So trapezoidal rule gives 1. That's the same as our analytical result. So that's correct. Therefore, the exact answer is 1, and the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. Wait, but maybe more precise numerical methods would show more decimals? Wait, but the exact answer is 1, so the numerical approximation is exactly 1. So the answer is 1. So the exact answer is 1, and the numerical approximation is 1.0000000000. Therefore, the JSON should be {"answer": "1", "numerical_answer": "1.0000000000"}. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me recheck. Let me compute the integral again. Let me do substitution t = 3^x. Then dt = 3^x ln3 dx, so dx = dt/(t ln3). The integral becomes ∫_{1/3}^3 [1/(t +1)] * [1/(t ln3)] dt. So that's (1/ln3) ∫_{1/3}^3 [1/(t(t +1))] dt. Then partial fractions: 1/(t(t+1)) = 1/t - 1/(t+1). So integrating from 1/3 to 3: (1/ln3)[ln t - ln(t+1)] from 1/3 to 3. Upper limit: ln3 - ln4. Lower limit: ln(1/3) - ln(4/3). So subtract lower from upper: [ln3 - ln4] - [ln(1/3) - ln(4/3)] = ln3 - ln4 - ln(1/3) + ln(4/3). Now, ln(1/3) = -ln3, so -ln(1/3) = ln3. Similarly, ln(4/3) = ln4 - ln3. So substituting: ln3 - ln4 + ln3 + ln4 - ln3. Combine terms: ln3 (1 +1 -1) + (-ln4 + ln4) = ln3. So the integral is (1/ln3)*ln3 = 1. So yes, the exact answer is 1. Therefore, the numerical approximation is exactly 1.0000000000. So the answer is correct.
