Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to 10 of e^(ln x) plus ln(e^x) dx. Hmm, first, I need to simplify the integrand before integrating. 

Starting with the first term, e raised to the natural log of x. Wait, e and ln are inverse functions, right? So e^(ln x) should simplify to just x. Let me check that. If I take the natural log of x and then exponentiate it, they cancel each other out. Yeah, that's correct. So e^(ln x) = x for x > 0, which is true here since the limits are from 1 to 10.

Now the second term is ln(e^x). Again, ln and e are inverses. So ln(e^x) simplifies to x. Because ln of e to any power is just that power. So ln(e^x) = x. So both terms in the integrand simplify to x. Therefore, the integrand e^(ln x) + ln(e^x) is x + x, which is 2x. 

So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 10 of 2x dx. That's straightforward. Now, the integral of 2x with respect to x is x squared, because the integral of x is (1/2)x², so 2 times that would be x². So integrating 2x gives x². Then we evaluate from 1 to 10.

Calculating the definite integral: plug in the upper limit first. At x=10, it's 10 squared which is 100. Then subtract the value at the lower limit, x=1, which is 1 squared, so 1. So 100 - 1 = 99. Therefore, the exact value of the integral is 99.

For the numerical approximation, since the exact answer is 99, the numerical value is just 99.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any mistake here. Let me verify each step again.

Original integrand: e^(ln x) + ln(e^x). Simplify each term. First term: e^(ln x) = x. Second term: ln(e^x) = x. So x + x = 2x. Integral of 2x from 1 to 10. Antiderivative is x². Evaluated at 10: 100, at 1:1. 100 -1 =99. Yep, that's correct. So the numerical approximation is exactly 99, so no decimal places needed, but the problem says to round to 10 decimal places, so it's 99.0000000000.

I think that's all. The steps are correct. The integral simplifies nicely, and the answer is straightforward.
