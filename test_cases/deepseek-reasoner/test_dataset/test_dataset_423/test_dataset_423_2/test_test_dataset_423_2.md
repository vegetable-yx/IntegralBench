Okay, let's tackle this integral step by step. The problem is to compute the definite integral from 1 to 10 of e^(ln x) plus ln(e^x) dx. Hmm, first, I need to simplify the integrand before integrating. 

Starting with the first term, e raised to the natural log of x. Wait, e and ln are inverse functions, right? So e^(ln x) should simplify to just x. Let me check that. If I take e to the power of ln x, that's the same as x, because e and ln cancel each other out. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now the second term is ln(e^x). Similarly, ln and e are inverses here too. The natural logarithm of e^x is just x. Because ln(e^x) = x * ln(e), and ln(e) is 1. So that term also simplifies to x. 

So putting those together, the integrand e^(ln x) + ln(e^x) simplifies to x + x, which is 2x. Wait, really? So the entire integrand simplifies to 2x? That seems straightforward. Let me confirm again. 

Original integrand: e^(ln x) is x, ln(e^x) is x. So x + x = 2x. Yep, that's correct. So the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 10 of 2x dx. 

Now, integrating 2x with respect to x. The antiderivative of 2x is 2*(x^2)/2, which simplifies to x^2. Because the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), so here n=1, so (x^2)/2 multiplied by 2 gives x^2. 

So the indefinite integral is x^2 + C. Now, evaluating from 1 to 10. So we plug in the upper limit first: 10^2 = 100, then subtract the lower limit: 1^2 = 1. So 100 - 1 = 99. 

So the exact value of the integral is 99. 

Now, the numerical approximation. Since 99 is already an integer, rounding to 10 decimal places would just be 99.0000000000. But let me make sure there's no mistake here. Wait, the integral of 2x from 1 to 10 is indeed [x²] from 1 to 10, which is 100 - 1 = 99. So the numerical value is exactly 99.0, so when rounded to 10 decimals, it's 99.0000000000. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if the simplification steps are correct. Let me verify again. 

e^(ln x) = x for x > 0, which is true here since the limits are from 1 to 10. Then ln(e^x) = x, since ln(e^x) = x * ln(e) = x * 1 = x. So yes, the integrand is 2x. Integrating 2x gives x², evaluated from 1 to 10 gives 99. 

So everything checks out. The answer is 99 exactly, and numerically it's 99.0000000000. 

I think that's all. No mistakes here. The problem was straightforward once the integrand was simplified properly.
