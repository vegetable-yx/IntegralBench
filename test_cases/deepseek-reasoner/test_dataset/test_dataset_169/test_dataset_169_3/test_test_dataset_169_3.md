Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of x times the natural logarithm of (1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²)) multiplied by the complete elliptic integral of the first kind K(0.5x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what K(m) represents. The complete elliptic integral of the first kind K(m) is defined as the integral from 0 to π/2 of 1/sqrt(1 - m sin²θ) dθ. Here, the parameter m is 0.5x, so K(0.5x) would be part of the integrand. But integrating this product with the logarithmic term might be tricky. Maybe there's a substitution or some known integral formula that can help here.

Looking at the logarithm term: ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))]. Let me simplify that expression inside the log. Let's denote sqrt(1 - x²) as y for a moment. Then the argument becomes (1 + y)/(1 - y). The logarithm of that is 2 artanh(y), since artanh(z) = 0.5 ln[(1+z)/(1-z)]. So, ln[(1 + y)/(1 - y)] = 2 artanh(y). Therefore, the integrand becomes x * 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) * K(0.5x).

So, the integral is 2 ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) K(0.5x) dx. Hmm, artanh(sqrt(1 - x²))... Let me see. If I let t = sqrt(1 - x²), then x = sqrt(1 - t²), and dx = (-t)/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. But when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 1 to 0. So changing variables might flip the limits. Let me try that substitution.

Let t = sqrt(1 - x²). Then x = sqrt(1 - t²), dx = (-t)/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. So when x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. Therefore, the integral becomes 2 ∫₁⁰ sqrt(1 - t²) * artanh(t) * K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) * (-t)/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. The negative sign flips the limits back to 0 to 1, and sqrt(1 - t²) cancels with 1/sqrt(1 - t²), leaving t. So the integral simplifies to 2 ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution?

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts. Let me consider integrating by parts with u being the logarithmic term and dv being x K(0.5x) dx. But I need to know the derivative of the logarithmic term and the integral of x K(0.5x). Let's see.

Let u = ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] = 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)). Then du/dx = 2 * derivative of artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)). The derivative of artanh(z) is 1/(1 - z²) * dz/dx. So, z = sqrt(1 - x²), dz/dx = (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²). Therefore, du/dx = 2 * [1/(1 - (1 - x²))] * (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²). Wait, 1 - z² is 1 - (1 - x²) = x². So du/dx = 2 * (1/x²) * (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²) = 2 * (-1)/(x sqrt(1 - x²)).

Hmm, that seems a bit. Then dv = x K(0.5x) dx. So we need to find v, which is the integral of x K(0.5x) dx. But integrating x K(0.5x) might not be straightforward. Maybe there's a known integral for K(kx) or something. Alternatively, perhaps expanding K(0.5x) as a series and integrating term by term. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can simplify the original integral. Let me think about the argument of K is 0.5x. The complete elliptic integral K(k) has some known integrals, especially when multiplied by other functions. Maybe using some integral representations or identities.

Alternatively, perhaps changing variables to make the argument of K simpler. Let me set t = 0.5x. Then x = 2t, dx = 2 dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀⁰·⁵ 2t ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - (2t)²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - (2t)²))] K(t) * 2 dt. Wait, but when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 0.5. So the integral becomes 4 ∫₀⁰·⁵ t ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - 4t²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - 4t²))] K(t) dt. Hmm, not sure if that helps. The sqrt(1 - 4t²) inside the log complicates things.

Wait, maybe another substitution. Let me consider the expression inside the log: (1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²)). Let me rationalize that. Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sqrt(1 - x²)):

[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))²]/[(1)^2 - (sqrt(1 - x²))²] = [1 + 2 sqrt(1 - x²) + (1 - x²)] / [1 - (1 - x²)] = [2 + 2 sqrt(1 - x²) - x²] / x². Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express the log term in terms of inverse hyperbolic functions. As I did before, it's 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)).

Alternatively, maybe express artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) in terms of logarithms. Wait, artanh(z) = 0.5 ln[(1+z)/(1-z)], so 2 artanh(z) = ln[(1+z)/(1-z)], which is the original expression. So maybe that's a way to relate it to some trigonometric substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution θ such that x = sinθ. Let me try that. Let x = sinθ, so θ goes from 0 to π/2. Then sqrt(1 - x²) = cosθ. Then the log term becomes ln[(1 + cosθ)/(1 - cosθ)] = ln[(2 cos²(θ/2))/(2 sin²(θ/2))] = ln[cot²(θ/2)] = 2 ln(cot(θ/2)) = 2 ln(tan(π/4 - θ/2))? Wait, cot(θ/2) is also equal to (1 + cosθ)/sinθ. Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute:

(1 + cosθ)/(1 - cosθ) = [2 cos²(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] = cot²(θ/2). So ln(cot²(θ/2)) = 2 ln(cot(θ/2). So the log term is 2 ln(cot(θ/2)). Therefore, the integrand becomes sinθ * 2 ln(cot(θ/2)) * K(0.5 sinθ) * cosθ dθ. Wait, no, when x = sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ. So the original integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} sinθ * 2 ln(cot(θ/2)) * K(0.5 sinθ) * cosθ dθ. So that's 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sinθ cosθ ln(cot(θ/2)) K(0.5 sinθ) dθ. Hmm, not sure if that's better, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution t = θ/2. Let θ = 2t, so t goes from 0 to π/4. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/4} sin(2t) cos(2t) ln(cot(t)) K(0.5 sin(2t)) * 2 dt. Wait, because dθ = 2 dt. So total factor becomes 2 * 2 = 4. Then sin(2t) cos(2t) = 0.5 sin(4t). Hmm, this seems to be getting more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe expanding the logarithmic term. Let's recall that ln(cot(θ/2)) = ln(cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)) = ln(1/tan(θ/2)) = -ln(tan(θ/2)). But tan(θ/2) = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using series expansion for the logarithmic term. Let me recall that artanh(z) = sum_{n=0}^∞ (z^{2n+1})/(2n+1) for |z| < 1. Since sqrt(1 - x²) is between 0 and 1 for x in (0,1), so artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) can be expanded as a series. So 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) = 2 sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (sqrt(1 - x²))^{2n+1} ] / (2n + 1). Which simplifies to 2 sum_{n=0}^∞ (1 - x²)^{n + 0.5} / (2n + 1). Then the integrand becomes x * 2 sum_{n=0}^∞ (1 - x²)^{n + 0.5} / (2n + 1) * K(0.5x). Then interchanging the sum and integral, we get 2 sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/(2n + 1)] ∫₀¹ x (1 - x²)^{n + 0.5} K(0.5x) dx. But integrating x (1 - x²)^{n + 0.5} K(0.5x) dx might not be straightforward. Unless there's a known integral involving K(k) multiplied by polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding K(0.5x) as a series. The complete elliptic integral K(k) can be expressed as a power series: K(k) = (π/2) sum_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! ) / (2^{2m} (m!)^2 ) ]^2 k^{2m} }. So K(0.5x) = (π/2) sum_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! ) / (2^{2m} (m!)^2 ) ]^2 (0.5x)^{2m} } = (π/2) sum_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! )^2 / (2^{4m} (m!)^4 ) ] x^{2m} }.

Then the integrand becomes x * 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) * (π/2) sum_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! )^2 / (2^{4m} (m!)^4 ) ] x^{2m} }.

So combining constants, we get π sum_{m=0}^∞ [ ( (2m)! )^2 / (2^{4m} (m!)^4 ) ] ∫₀¹ x^{2m + 1} artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) dx.

But this seems like a very complicated approach, leading to a double sum. Maybe not the best way. Perhaps there's a smarter substitution or identity.

Wait, let's go back to the original integral:

I = ∫₀¹ x ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] K(0.5x) dx.

As we saw earlier, the log term is 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)). So,

I = 2 ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) K(0.5x) dx.

Let me consider substitution t = sqrt(1 - x²). Then x = sqrt(1 - t²), dx = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. When x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes:

2 ∫₁⁰ sqrt(1 - t²) artanh(t) K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt.

The negative sign flips the limits, and sqrt(1 - t²) cancels:

2 ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt.

Hmm, not sure if that's better. Maybe another substitution here. Let me set u = 0.5 sqrt(1 - t²). Then t = sqrt(1 - 4u²), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express K in terms of an integral and switch the order.

Wait, K(k) is an integral itself. So K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) = ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - (0.5 sqrt(1 - t²))² sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ. So substituting that into the integral, we get:

I = 2 ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) [ ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - (0.25 (1 - t²)) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dt.

Then switching the order of integration:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) [1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dt dθ.

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps differentiating under the integral sign. Let me consider if the integral can be expressed as a derivative with respect to some parameter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe look for known integrals involving K(k) and logarithmic functions. I recall that sometimes integrals involving elliptic integrals can be related to hypergeometric functions or other special functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using integration by parts. Let me try that again. Let u = artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)), dv = x K(0.5x) dx. Then du = [ derivative we calculated earlier ] dx = (-1)/(x sqrt(1 - x²)) dx. Wait, earlier we had du/dx = 2 * [1/(x²)] * (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²) = -2/(x sqrt(1 - x²)). Wait, no, earlier when we set u = 2 artanh(...), then du/dx was -2/(x sqrt(1 - x²)). But in this case, u is artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)), so du/dx = [1/(1 - (1 - x²))] * derivative of sqrt(1 - x²). Which is [1/x²] * (-x)/sqrt(1 - x²) = -1/(x sqrt(1 - x²)). So du = -1/(x sqrt(1 - x²)) dx.

Then dv = x K(0.5x) dx. So we need to find v, which is the integral of x K(0.5x) dx. Let me see if I can find that. Let me make a substitution here. Let’s set w = 0.5x, so x = 2w, dx = 2dw. Then the integral becomes ∫ x K(0.5x) dx = ∫ 2w K(w) * 2 dw = 4 ∫ w K(w) dw. So we need to compute ∫ w K(w) dw. Hmm, is there a known integral for w K(w) dw?

I recall that the integral of K(w) is something, but integrating w K(w) might require integration by parts. Let me try integrating w K(w) dw. Let’s set u = w, dv = K(w) dw. Then du = dw, and v = ∫ K(w) dw. But I don't know the integral of K(w) off the top of my head. Wait, maybe there's a series expansion. K(w) = (π/2) sum_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! ) / (2^{2n} (n!)^2 ) ]^2 w^{2n} }, so integrating term by term:

∫ K(w) dw = (π/2) sum_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! )^2 / (2^{4n} (n!)^4 ) ] ∫ w^{2n} dw = (π/2) sum_{n=0}^∞ [ ( (2n)! )^2 / (2^{4n} (n!)^4 ) ] w^{2n + 1}/(2n + 1) ) + C.

But this seems complicated. Maybe not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the integral definition of K(k). Let me write K(0.5x) as ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - (0.5x)^2 sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ. Then the original integral becomes:

I = ∫₀¹ x * 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) * [ ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - 0.25x² sin²θ]^{-1/2} dθ ] dx.

Then switching the order of integration:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) [1 - 0.25x² sin²θ]^{-1/2} dx dθ.

Hmm, maybe changing variables in the inner integral. Let’s set t = sqrt(1 - x²), so x = sqrt(1 - t²), dx = -t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Then when x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. So the inner integral becomes:

∫₁⁰ sqrt(1 - t²) artanh(t) [1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) dt.

Simplifying, the negative flips the limits, and sqrt(1 - t²) cancels:

∫₀¹ t artanh(t) [1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dt.

So the entire integral I becomes:

2 ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) [1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} dt dθ.

Hmm, still complicated. Maybe there's a way to express this in terms of known integrals. Alternatively, perhaps using some hypergeometric function identities.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding [1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} as a binomial series. Since [1 - z]^{-1/2} = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ) z^k. So:

[1 - 0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^{-1/2} = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ) [0.25(1 - t²) sin²θ]^k = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ) (0.25^k (1 - t²)^k sin^{2k}θ ) = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ) (1/4^k) (1 - t²)^k sin^{2k}θ ) = sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (16^k (k!)^2 ) (1 - t²)^k sin^{2k}θ ).

Substituting this into the integral I:

I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (16^k (k!)^2 ) (1 - t²)^k sin^{2k}θ dt dθ.

Interchange sum and integrals:

I = 2 sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (16^k (k!)^2 ) ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}θ dθ ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) (1 - t²)^k dt.

Now, the integral over θ is known: ∫₀^{π/2} sin^{2k}θ dθ = (π/2) ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ). So substituting that in:

I = 2 sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! ) / (16^k (k!)^2 ) * (π/2) ( (2k)! ) / (4^k (k!)^2 ) ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) (1 - t²)^k dt.

Simplifying the constants:

I = π sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! )^2 / (16^k 4^k (k!)^4 ) ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) (1 - t²)^k dt.

Which is π sum_{k=0}^∞ ( (2k)! )^2 / (64^k (k!)^4 ) ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) (1 - t²)^k dt.

Hmm, now we need to compute the integral J_k = ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) (1 - t²)^k dt.

Let me focus on J_k. Let's perform substitution u = t². Let u = t², so du = 2t dt, t dt = du/2. Then J_k becomes ∫₀¹ artanh(sqrt(u)) (1 - u)^k * (du/2). So J_k = (1/2) ∫₀¹ artanh(sqrt(u)) (1 - u)^k} du.

But artanh(sqrt(u)) = 0.5 ln[(1 + sqrt(u))/(1 - sqrt(u))]. Let me set v = sqrt(u), so u = v², du = 2v dv. Then J_k = (1/2) ∫₀¹ artanh(v) (1 - v²)^k * 2v dv = ∫₀¹ v artanh(v) (1 - v²)^k dv.

Hmm, back to similar integral. Maybe integrating by parts. Let’s set w = artanh(v), dw = 1/(1 - v²) dv. Let dv = v (1 - v²)^k dv. Wait, no, integrating by parts:

Let’s set u_part = artanh(v), dv_part = v (1 - v²)^k dv.

Then du_part = 1/(1 - v²) dv.

To find v_part, integrate dv_part = v (1 - v²)^k dv. Let’s set z = 1 - v², dz = -2v dv. So v dv = -dz/2. Then dv_part = - (1/2) z^k dz. So v_part = - (1/2) ∫ z^k dz = - (1/2) [ z^{k+1}/(k + 1) ) ] + C = - z^{k+1}/(2(k + 1)) + C = - (1 - v²)^{k+1}/(2(k + 1)) + C.

Therefore, integrating by parts:

J_k = u_part v_part |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v_part du_part.

At v=1, artanh(v) tends to infinity, but (1 - v²)^{k+1} tends to 0. So the boundary term is 0 - [ - (1 - 0²)^{k+1}/(2(k + 1)) * artanh(0) ] = 0, since artanh(0) = 0. So the integral becomes:

J_k = - ∫₀¹ [ - (1 - v²)^{k+1}/(2(k + 1)) ] * [1/(1 - v²)] dv = (1/(2(k + 1))) ∫₀¹ (1 - v²)^{k} dv.

So J_k = 1/(2(k + 1)) ∫₀¹ (1 - v²)^{k} dv.

The integral ∫₀¹ (1 - v²)^k dv is a Beta function. Let’s set w = v², then v = sqrt(w), dv = (1/(2 sqrt(w))) dw. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - w)^k * (1/(2 sqrt(w))) dw = (1/2) ∫₀¹ w^{-1/2} (1 - w)^k dw = (1/2) B(1/2, k + 1) = (1/2) [ Γ(1/2) Γ(k + 1) / Γ(k + 3/2) ) ].

We know Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π), Γ(k + 1) = k!, and Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 1/2) Γ(k + 1/2). Using the property Γ(z + 1) = z Γ(z), so Γ(k + 3/2) = (k + 1/2)(k - 1/2)...(1/2) Γ(1/2) = (sqrt(π)/2^k) (2k + 1)!!). But maybe it's better to express in terms of factorials.

Alternatively, B(1/2, k + 1) = (sqrt(π) Γ(k + 1)) / Γ(k + 3/2). And Γ(k + 3/2) = (2k + 1)!! sqrt(π) / 2^{k + 1}. Therefore, B(1/2, k + 1) = sqrt(π) k! / [ (2k + 1)!! sqrt(π) / 2^{k + 1} ) ] = k! 2^{k + 1} / (2k + 1)!!.

But (2k + 1)!! = (2k + 1)(2k - 1)...3*1 = (2k + 1)! ) / (2^k k! ). Therefore, B(1/2, k + 1) = k! 2^{k + 1} / [ (2k + 1)! / (2^k k! ) ) ] = k! 2^{k + 1} * 2^k k! / (2k + 1)! ) = 2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ).

Therefore, ∫₀¹ (1 - v²)^k dv = (1/2) B(1/2, k + 1) = (1/2) * 2^{2k + 1} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) = 2^{2k} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ).

Therefore, J_k = 1/(2(k + 1)) * 2^{2k} (k! )² / (2k + 1)! ) = 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)! ) ].

But (2k + 1)! = (2k + 1)(2k)! ), so:

J_k = 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ] = 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ].

Simplifying, note that (k + 1)(2k + 1) = (2k + 1)(k + 1). Also, (k! )² / (2k)! ) = 1 / [ (2k)! / (k! )² ) ] = 1 / C(2k, k). But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, we can write this as:

J_k = 2^{2k - 1} / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] * [ (k! )² / (2k)! ) ].

But [ (k! )² / (2k)! ) ] = 1 / C(2k, k). And C(2k, k) = (2k)! / (k! )². So J_k = 2^{2k - 1} / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) C(2k, k) ) ].

But I'm not sure if this helps in simplifying the sum. Let's substitute J_k back into the expression for I:

I = π sum_{k=0}^∞ [ ( (2k)! )^2 / (64^k (k! )^4 ) ] * [ 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ) ].

Simplifying term by term:

First, (2k)! )^2 / (64^k (k! )^4 ) * 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ) =

= ( (2k)! )^2 * 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² ) / [ 64^k (k! )^4 (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ] )

= 2^{2k - 1} (2k)! ) / [ 64^k (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ]

= 2^{2k - 1} (2k)! ) / [ 64^k (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ]

But 64^k = (2^6)^k = 2^{6k}, so:

= 2^{2k - 1} / 2^{6k} * (2k)! / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ]

= 2^{-4k - 1} (2k)! / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ]

Hmm, so I = π sum_{k=0}^∞ 2^{-4k - 1} (2k)! / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

This seems like a hypergeometric series. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of known constants or functions.

Let’s write the term as:

Term_k = 2^{-4k - 1} (2k)! / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

We can write (2k)! / (k! )^2 = C(2k, k), the binomial coefficient. So:

Term_k = 2^{-4k - 1} C(2k, k) / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

Let’s factor out the 2^{-4k - 1} and write C(2k, k) as 4^k / sqrt(π k) asymptotically, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express this as:

Term_k = 2^{-4k - 1} / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] * C(2k, k).

But I'm not sure. Let me see if the sum can be recognized. Let's write the sum as:

I = (π / 2) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] (1/16)^k.

Wait, 2^{-4k} = (1/16)^k. So:

I = (π / 2) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] (1/16)^k.

Hmm, this looks like a hypergeometric function. Let me recall that sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). But here we have additional terms in the denominator. Let me see.

Let’s consider the generating function for C(2k, k). We know that sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). But our sum has terms divided by (k + 1)(2k + 1). Let me see if integrating or differentiating can help.

Let’s denote S = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] x^k.

Let me write this as S = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

Let’s make a substitution m = k + 1. Then k = m - 1, and when k=0, m=1. So:

S = sum_{m=1}^\infty C(2(m - 1), m - 1) x^{m - 1} / [ m (2(m - 1) + 1) ) ] = sum_{m=1}^\infty C(2m - 2, m - 1) x^{m - 1} / [ m (2m - 1) ) ].

Let’s shift index back to k = m - 1:

S = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / [ (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

Hmm, same as before. Maybe integrating term by term. Let’s consider integrating the generating function.

Let’s consider that ∫ sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k dx = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^{k + 1} / (k + 1) + C. Which is similar to the sum we have but missing the 1/(2k + 1) term.

Alternatively, integrating again. Let’s see:

Let’s define S = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] x^k.

Let’s consider integrating S with respect to x. Let’s compute ∫ S dx:

∫ S dx = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] x^{k + 1} / (k + 1) + C.

But this doesn't directly help. Alternatively, perhaps consider integrating twice.

Alternatively, note that 1/( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) can be expressed as partial fractions:

1/( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) = A/(k + 1) + B/(2k + 1).

Solving for A(2k + 1) + B(k + 1) = 1.

Setting k = -1: A( -2 + 1 ) + B(0) = 1 => -A = 1 => A = -1.

Setting k = -0.5: A(0) + B(0.5) = 1 => B = 2.

So 1/( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) = -1/(k + 1) + 2/(2k + 1).

Therefore, S = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) [ -1/(k + 1) + 2/(2k + 1) ] x^k.

So S = - sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (k + 1) + 2 sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (2k + 1).

Let’s handle each sum separately.

First sum: S1 = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (k + 1).

Let’s note that C(2k, k)/(k + 1) is the Catalan numbers. The generating function for Catalan numbers is C(x) = sum_{k=0}^\infty C_k x^k, where C_k = C(2k, k)/(k + 1). So S1 = C(x), the generating function for Catalan numbers, which is (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x). But here, S1 = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (k + 1) = C(x) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x).

Second sum: S2 = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (2k + 1).

Let’s consider integrating the generating function for C(2k, k). Let’s recall that sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). Then, integrating both sides from 0 to x:

∫₀^x sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) t^k dt = ∫₀^x 1/sqrt(1 - 4t) dt.

Left side: sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^{k + 1}/(k + 1) = x sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^{k}/(k + 1) = x S1.

Right side: ∫ 1/sqrt(1 - 4t) dt = (-1/2) sqrt(1 - 4t) + C. Evaluated from 0 to x:

(-1/2) sqrt(1 - 4x) + 1/2.

Therefore, x S1 = (-1/2) sqrt(1 - 4x) + 1/2.

But S1 = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x), which matches.

Now, for S2 = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k / (2k + 1).

Let’s consider integrating the generating function multiplied by t^{2k} or something. Alternatively, note that 1/(2k + 1) = ∫₀¹ t^{2k} dt.

So S2 = sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) x^k ∫₀¹ t^{2k} dt = ∫₀¹ sum_{k=0}^\infty C(2k, k) (x t²)^k dt.

The sum inside is 1/sqrt(1 - 4x t²). Therefore, S2 = ∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(1 - 4x t²) dt.

Let’s compute this integral:

Let u = t, dv = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x t²) dt. But actually, substitution z = t sqrt(4x). Let’s set z = 2 sqrt(x) t, so t = z/(2 sqrt(x)), dt = dz/(2 sqrt(x)). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2 sqrt(x)} 1/sqrt(1 - z²) * dz/(2 sqrt(x)) ) = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) arcsin(z) |₀^{2 sqrt(x)}.

But arcsin(2 sqrt(x)) is real only if 2 sqrt(x) ≤ 1, i.e., x ≤ 1/4. So if x ≤ 1/4, then S2 = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) arcsin(2 sqrt(x)).

But in our case, x = 1/16, which is less than 1/4, so this is valid.

Therefore, S2 = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) arcsin(2 sqrt(x)).

Therefore, S = - S1 + 2 S2 = - (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x) + 2 * (1/(2 sqrt(x))) arcsin(2 sqrt(x)).

Simplifying:

S = - (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x) + (1/sqrt(x)) arcsin(2 sqrt(x)).

Now, substituting x = 1/16:

S = - (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/16)))/(2*(1/16)) + (1/sqrt(1/16)) arcsin(2*sqrt(1/16)).

Compute each term:

First term: 1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/16)) = 1 - sqrt(1 - 1/4) = 1 - sqrt(3/4) = 1 - (√3)/2.

Denominator: 2*(1/16) = 1/8. So first term: - [1 - (√3)/2 ] / (1/8) = -8(1 - √3/2) = -8 + 4√3.

Second term: (1/sqrt(1/16)) = 4. arcsin(2*sqrt(1/16)) = arcsin(2*(1/4)) = arcsin(1/2) = π/6.

So second term: 4 * π/6 = (2π)/3.

Therefore, S = (-8 + 4√3) + (2π)/3.

Therefore, the sum S = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] (1/16)^k = (-8 + 4√3) + (2π)/3.

But wait, this seems problematic because the sum S was expressed as S = - S1 + 2 S2, and when x = 1/16, S1 and S2 were computed accordingly. But according to our previous steps, S = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] x^k = - S1 + 2 S2. But when x = 1/16, we have:

S = - [ (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/16)) ) / (2*(1/16)) ] + 2 * [ (1/(2 sqrt(1/16))) arcsin(2*sqrt(1/16)) ].

Wait, let me recheck:

S = - S1 + 2 S2, where S1 = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x), and S2 = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) arcsin(2 sqrt(x)).

So substituting x = 1/16:

S1 = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/16)))/(2*(1/16)) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 1/4))/(1/8) = (1 - sqrt(3/4))/ (1/8) = (1 - (√3)/2) * 8 = 8 - 4√3.

S2 = (1/(2*sqrt(1/16))) arcsin(2*sqrt(1/16)) = (1/(2*(1/4))) arcsin(2*(1/4)) = (2) * arcsin(1/2) = 2*(π/6) = π/3.

Therefore, S = - S1 + 2 S2 = - (8 - 4√3) + 2*(π/3) = -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3.

Therefore, the sum S = -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3.

Therefore, going back to the expression for I:

I = (π / 2) * S = (π / 2) * ( -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3 ).

Wait, no. Wait, earlier we had:

I = π sum_{k=0}^\infty [ ... ] = π * (S) where S was sum_{k=0}^\infty [ ... ].

Wait, no. Wait, in the previous steps, after substituting J_k into I, we had:

I = π sum_{k=0}^\infty [ ( (2k)! )^2 / (64^k (k! )^4 ) ] * [ 2^{2k - 1} (k! )² / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1)(2k)! ) ) ].

Which simplified to:

I = π sum_{k=0}^\infty 2^{-4k - 1} (2k)! / [ (k! )^2 (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ].

But then we expressed this sum as:

I = (π / 2) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] (1/16)^k.

Which is (π / 2) * S, where S is the sum we computed as S = -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3.

Therefore, I = (π / 2) * ( -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3 ).

But this leads to:

I = (π / 2)(-8 + 4√3) + (π / 2)(2π/3) = -4π + 2π√3 + (π²)/3.

But this seems to be the analytical result. Let me check the computation again.

Wait, S = sum_{k=0}^\infty [ C(2k, k) / ( (k + 1)(2k + 1) ) ] (1/16)^k = -8 + 4√3 + (2π)/3.

Therefore, I = (π / 2) * S = (π / 2)(-8 + 4√3 + 2π/3) = -4π + 2π√3 + π²/3.

So the exact answer is I = (π²)/3 + 2π√3 - 4π.

We can factor π:

I = π( π/3 + 2√3 - 4 ).

But let me verify if this makes sense. Let's compute the numerical value.

First, compute each term:

π ≈ 3.1415926536

π² ≈ 9.869604401

2π√3 ≈ 2 * 3.1415926536 * 1.73205080757 ≈ 2 * 3.1415926536 * 1.73205080757 ≈ 10.882796185

4π ≈ 12.566370614

So putting it all together:

π²/3 ≈ 9.869604401 / 3 ≈ 3.2898681337

2π√3 ≈ 10.882796185

-4π ≈ -12.566370614

Sum: 3.2898681337 + 10.882796185 - 12.566370614 ≈ (3.2898681337 + 10.882796185) = 14.1726643187 - 12.566370614 ≈ 1.6062937047.

So the numerical value is approximately 1.6062937047. Let me check with a numerical approximation of the original integral to see if this makes sense.

But before that, let me check if there's a mistake in the sign. Because when we computed S = - S1 + 2 S2, with S1 = 8 - 4√3 and S2 = π/3, so S = - (8 - 4√3) + 2*(π/3) = -8 + 4√3 + 2π/3. Then I = (π/2)*S = (π/2)*(-8 + 4√3 + 2π/3). So expanding:

I = (π/2)*(-8) + (π/2)*(4√3) + (π/2)*(2π/3) = -4π + 2π√3 + π²/3. Which is correct.

But when we compute this numerically, we get approximately 1.6062937047. Let me check with a numerical integration.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the analytical calculation. Let me verify the steps.

Wait, when we did the substitution for S2, we had S2 = ∫₀¹ 1/sqrt(1 - 4x t²) dt. Then we set z = 2 sqrt(x) t, so t = z/(2 sqrt(x)), dt = dz/(2 sqrt(x)). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{2 sqrt(x)} 1/sqrt(1 - z²) * dz/(2 sqrt(x)) ). But the upper limit is z = 2 sqrt(x) * 1 = 2 sqrt(x). So the integral is (1/(2 sqrt(x))) * arcsin(z) from 0 to 2 sqrt(x). So arcsin(2 sqrt(x)) is valid only if 2 sqrt(x) ≤ 1, i.e., x ≤ 1/4. In our case, x = 1/16, which is 0.0625, so 2 sqrt(1/16) = 2*(1/4) = 0.5 ≤ 1, so valid. Therefore, S2 = (1/(2 sqrt(x))) * arcsin(2 sqrt(x)) = (1/(2*(1/4))) * arcsin(0.5) = 2 * (π/6) = π/3. So that part is correct.

Similarly, S1 = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4x))/(2x) = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*(1/16)))/(2*(1/16)) = (1 - sqrt(3/4))/(1/8) = (1 - (√3)/2)*8 = 8 - 4√3. So S = - S1 + 2 S2 = -8 + 4√3) + 2*(π/3) = -8 + 4√3 + 2π/3. Then I = (π/2)*S = (π/2)*(-8 + 4√3 + 2π/3) ≈ (3.1415926536/2)*(-8 + 4*1.73205080757 + 2*3.1415926536/3).

Compute inside the parentheses:

-8 + 4*1.73205080757 ≈ -8 + 6.92820323028 ≈ -1.07179676972

2*3.1415926536/3 ≈ 6.2831853072/3 ≈ 2.0943951024

So total inside: -1.07179676972 + 2.0943951024 ≈ 1.02259833268

Multiply by π/2 ≈ 1.02259833268 * 1.57079632679 ≈ 1.6062937047.

So the analytical result is approximately 1.6062937047. Let me check with a quick numerical integration.

Using Wolfram Alpha, for example, compute the integral numerically:

Integrate[x * Log[(1 + Sqrt[1 - x^2])/(1 - Sqrt[1 - x^2])] * EllipticK[(0.5x)^2], {x, 0, 1}]

Wait, but note that in Mathematica, EllipticK[m] takes the parameter m, not the modulus k. So if the original integral uses K(0.5x), which is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with parameter m = (0.5x)^2. Wait, the definition can vary. Some sources define K(k) with k as the modulus, and others use the parameter m = k². In Mathematica, EllipticK[m] uses the parameter m. So if the original integral is K(0.5x), which is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with parameter m = (0.5x)^2, then in Mathematica, it's EllipticK[(0.5x)^2]. But the original problem states K(0.5x), so we need to confirm the parameter.

Wait, the user wrote K(0.5x). The standard definition of K(k) is with k as the modulus. However, in some contexts, especially in older literature, K(m) is used with m = k². So there's a confusion between the elliptic modulus k and the parameter m = k². For example, in Mathematica, EllipticK[m] uses the parameter m = k². So if the problem uses K(k) with k = 0.5x, then in Mathematica, it's EllipticK[(0.5x)^2]. But if the problem uses K(m) with m = 0.5x, then it's EllipticK[0.5x]. This is crucial for numerical evaluation.

Assuming that the problem uses the parameter m = 0.5x (as written), then in Mathematica, it's EllipticK[0.5x]. But to check, let's compute the numerical value.

But given that our analytical result is approximately 1.6062937047, let's see if that matches.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the analytical steps. Let me check the key steps again.

We started with the integral I = ∫₀¹ x ln[(1 + sqrt(1 - x²))/(1 - sqrt(1 - x²))] K(0.5x) dx.

Expressed the log term as 2 artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)), leading to I = 2 ∫₀¹ x artanh(sqrt(1 - x²)) K(0.5x) dx.

Then substitution t = sqrt(1 - x²), leading to I = 2 ∫₀¹ t artanh(t) K(0.5 sqrt(1 - t²)) dt.

Then expanded K in a series, switched integrals, and after a long process, arrived at I = π/3 + 2π√3 - 4π. Wait, no, the exact expression was I = π²/3 + 2π√3 - 4π.

But when we computed the numerical value, it was approximately 1.6062937047. Let me compute this using another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the analytical result is correct, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.6062937047, which rounds to 1.6062937047. Let me check with a numerical integration.

But since I can't compute it here, I'll proceed with the analytical result.

Therefore, the exact answer is I = π²/3 + 2π√3 - 4π. We can factor π:

I = π(π/3 + 2√3 - 4).

But let's write it as:

I = \frac{\pi^2}{3} + 2\pi\sqrt{3} - 4\pi.

Alternatively, combining terms:

I = \frac{\pi^2}{3} - 4\pi + 2\pi\sqrt{3}.

This is the analytical result. The numerical approximation is approximately 1.6062937047, which rounds to 1.6062937047 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

But let me check with a calculator:

π²/3 ≈ 3.2898681337

2π√3 ≈ 10.8827961854

-4π ≈ -12.5663706144

Adding them up: 3.2898681337 + 10.8827961854 = 14.1726643191

14.1726643191 - 12.5663706144 = 1.6062937047.

Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is π²/3 + 2π√3 - 4π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.6062937047.
