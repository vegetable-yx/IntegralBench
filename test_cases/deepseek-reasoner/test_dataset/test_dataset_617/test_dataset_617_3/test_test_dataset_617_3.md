Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral of cos(x + cos(x)) from 0 to π. Let me start by thinking about how to approach this. Hmm, the integral is ∫₀^π cos(x + cos(x)) dx. 

First, I remember that integrating functions with composite arguments can be tricky. Maybe there's a substitution or some symmetry I can use here. Let me check if the integrand has any symmetry over the interval [0, π]. The function inside the cosine is x + cos(x). Let's see, if I substitute x with π - t, maybe? Let's try that to see if there's a symmetry.

Let’s set t = π - x. Then when x = 0, t = π, and when x = π, t = 0. The differential dx becomes -dt. So the integral becomes ∫ from π to 0 of cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) (-dt) which is the same as ∫₀^π cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) dt. 

Now, cos(π - t) is equal to -cos(t), right? Because cosine is an even function and cos(π - θ) = -cosθ. So substituting that in, the argument becomes π - t + (-cos(t)) = π - t - cos(t). So the integral becomes ∫₀^π cos(π - t - cos(t)) dt. Let me write that as ∫₀^π cos(π - [t + cos(t)]) dt. 

Using the identity cos(π - θ) = -cosθ, because cos(π - θ) = -cosθ. Wait, no, actually cos(π - θ) = -cosθ. Wait, let me confirm. Yes, cos(π - θ) = -cosθ. So cos(π - (t + cos t)) = -cos(t + cos t). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt. But since the variable of integration is just a dummy variable, we can replace t with x, so this is -∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx. 

But the original integral is I = ∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx. So after substitution, we have I = -I. Wait, that would mean I = -I, which implies 2I = 0, so I = 0. Is that possible? Let me check again.

Wait, let me retrace. The substitution step: original integral is I = ∫₀^π cos(x + cos x) dx. After substitution t = π - x, we get I = ∫₀^π cos(π - t - cos t) dt. Then using cos(π - A) = -cos A, where A = t + cos t. So cos(π - A) = -cos A, so the integrand becomes -cos(A) = -cos(t + cos t). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt = -∫₀^π cos(t + cos t) dt = -I. Therefore, I = -I, so 2I = 0, so I = 0. 

So the integral is zero? That seems surprising, but maybe due to symmetry. Let me verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral numerically to check. For example, approximate the integral from 0 to π of cos(x + cos x) dx. Let me think of some sample points. At x=0, cos(0 + cos0) = cos(0 + 1) = cos(1) ≈ 0.5403. At x=π/2, cos(π/2 + cos(π/2)) = cos(π/2 + 0) = cos(π/2) = 0. At x=π, cos(π + cosπ) = cos(π + (-1)) = cos(π -1) ≈ cos(2.1416) ≈ -0.4161. So the function starts positive, goes to zero at π/2, then becomes negative. The area from 0 to π/2 might cancel out the area from π/2 to π. But is it exactly zero? Let me check with a rough approximation. Maybe using the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. Let's take two intervals: from 0 to π/2 and π/2 to π. The first interval: average of f(0) and f(π/2) is (0.5403 + 0)/2 = 0.27015, multiplied by π/2 ≈ 0.27015 * 1.5708 ≈ 0.424. Second interval: average of f(π/2)=0 and f(π)= -0.4161 is (-0.4161)/2 = -0.20805, multiplied by π/2 ≈ -0.20805 * 1.5708 ≈ -0.326. Total approximation: 0.424 -0.326 ≈ 0.098. So the integral is approximately 0.098? But according to the analytical result, it should be zero. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So maybe my substitution step is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, when I did the substitution t = π - x, then dx = -dt, so the integral becomes ∫ from π to 0 of cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫₀^π cos(π - t - cos t) dt. Then using cos(π - A) = -cos A, where A = t + cos t. Wait, but A is t + cos t, so π - A would be π - t - cos t. Wait, no. Wait, the argument inside the cosine after substitution is π - t - cos t. So that's π - (t + cos t). Therefore, cos(π - (t + cos t)) = -cos(t + cos t). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt = -I. Therefore, I = -I => 2I = 0 => I=0. But the numerical approximation suggested it's not zero. So perhaps my substitution is wrong, or the numerical approximation is too rough. Let me try a better numerical approximation. Let's split into more intervals. Let's take four intervals. For example, step size h = π/4. Compute the function at x=0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π.

Compute f(0) = cos(0 + 0) = cos(0) = 1. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the function is cos(x + cos x). At x=0, cos(0 + cos(0)) = cos(0 + 1) = cos(1) ≈ 0.5403. At x=π/4: cos(π/4 + cos(π/4)). cos(π/4) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. So π/4 ≈ 0.7854. So the argument is 0.7854 + 0.7071 ≈ 1.4925. cos(1.4925) ≈ 0.0747. 

At x=π/2: cos(π/2 + cos(π/2)) = cos(π/2 + 0) = cos(π/2) = 0.

At x=3π/4: cos(3π/4 + cos(3π/4)). cos(3π/4) is -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071. 3π/4 ≈ 2.3562. So argument is 2.3562 - 0.7071 ≈ 1.6491. cos(1.6491) ≈ -0.0747.

At x=π: cos(π + cos(π)) = cos(π -1) ≈ cos(2.1416) ≈ -0.4161.

Now, using the trapezoidal rule with 4 intervals (h = π/4):

The trapezoidal formula is (h/2)[f0 + 2f1 + 2f2 + 2f3 + f4]

h = π/4 ≈ 0.7854.

So:

(0.7854/2) [0.5403 + 2*(0.0747) + 2*(0) + 2*(-0.0747) + (-0.4161)]

Compute inside:

0.5403 + 0.1494 + 0 + (-0.1494) + (-0.4161) = 0.5403 + 0.1494 = 0.6897; 0.6897 -0.1494 = 0.5403; 0.5403 -0.4161 = 0.1242.

Multiply by h/2: 0.7854/2 ≈ 0.3927. 0.3927 * 0.1242 ≈ 0.0488. So the integral is approximately 0.0488. Hmm, that's still positive, but smaller. If I take more intervals, maybe it approaches zero? Wait, but according to the analytical solution, it's zero. So why the numerical approximation is not zero? Maybe the function is odd around x=π/2? Let me check. Let's see if f(π - x) = -f(x). Let's test x=0: f(π -0)=f(π)=cos(π + cosπ)=cos(π -1)≈-0.4161. f(0)=cos(0 +1)=cos(1)≈0.5403. So f(0) is 0.5403, f(π)≈-0.4161. So f(π -x) is not equal to -f(x). So maybe the function isn't odd around π/2. Wait, but the substitution suggested that the integral is equal to its negative, hence zero. But the numerical approximation suggests otherwise. There must be a mistake in the substitution step. Let me check again.

Original substitution: t = π - x. Then, when x goes from 0 to π, t goes from π to 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{x=0}^{x=π} cos(x + cosx) dx = ∫_{t=π}^{t=0} cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫_{0}^{π} cos(π - t + cos(π - t)) dt. Now, cos(π - t) = -cos t. So the argument inside the cosine is π - t + (-cos t) = π - t - cos t. So the integrand is cos(π - t - cos t). Now, can we express this as cos(π - (t + cos t))? Wait, π - t - cos t = π - (t + cos t). Therefore, cos(π - (t + cos t)) = -cos(t + cos t). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^π -cos(t + cos t) dt = -I. Therefore, I = -I => I=0. So according to this, the integral is zero. But the numerical approximation with 4 intervals gives about 0.0488, and with 2 intervals about 0.098. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, either the substitution is wrong, or the numerical approximation is not accurate enough. Let me check with a better numerical method. Maybe using Simpson's rule with more intervals. Let's try Simpson's 1/3 rule with n=4 (so two intervals for Simpson's). Wait, n=4 (even number of intervals). Simpson's rule requires even number of intervals. Wait, with n=4, we can apply Simpson's 1/3. Let's compute that. The points are at x=0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π. The function values are as before: f(0)=0.5403, f(π/4)=0.0747, f(π/2)=0, f(3π/4)=-0.0747, f(π)=-0.4161. Simpson's rule formula is (h/3)[f0 + 4f1 + 2f2 + 4f3 + f4]. h=π/4 ≈0.7854. So:

(0.7854/3) [0.5403 + 4*(0.0747) + 2*(0) + 4*(-0.0747) + (-0.4161)]

Compute inside:

0.5403 + 4*0.0747 = 0.5403 + 0.2988 = 0.8391

Then + 2*0 = 0.8391

Then +4*(-0.0747) = 0.8391 - 0.2988 = 0.5403

Then + (-0.4161) = 0.5403 -0.4161 = 0.1242

Multiply by h/3: 0.7854/3 ≈0.2618. 0.2618 *0.1242 ≈0.0325. So Simpson's rule gives approximately 0.0325. Still positive, but smaller. Hmm. If I use more points, maybe it's approaching zero? Let's try with n=8 intervals). But this is getting tedious. Alternatively, maybe the analytical result is correct, and the numerical approximation is not precise enough. Let me check with a calculator or use a more accurate method. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is incorrect. Wait, let me check the substitution again. The substitution step seems correct. If I = ∫₀^π cos(x + cosx) dx, and after substitution, I = -I, so I=0. Therefore, the integral is zero. But why the numerical approximation is not zero? Maybe the function is symmetric in such a way that the positive and negative areas cancel out exactly. Let me plot the function. From x=0 to π, the function cos(x + cosx). At x=0, it's cos(1) ≈0.5403. At x=π/2, it's cos(π/2 +0)=0. At x=π, it's cos(π -1)≈-0.4161. The function starts positive, decreases to zero at π/2, then becomes negative. The area from 0 to π/2 is positive, and from π/2 to π is negative. If these areas are equal in magnitude, the integral would be zero. But according to the numerical approximation, they are not exactly equal. But according to the substitution, they must be. So perhaps the substitution is correct, and the numerical approximation is just not accurate enough. Let me try a higher precision numerical integration. For example, using a calculator or computational tool. Alternatively, use more intervals. Let's try with n=1000 intervals. But since I can't compute that manually, maybe I can think of the integral's behavior. Alternatively, since the substitution shows that the integral is zero, perhaps the exact answer is zero, and the numerical approximation is due to computational error. Wait, but even with higher precision, if the integral is exactly zero, the numerical approximation should approach zero as the number of intervals increases. Let me check with a better approximation. Let's use the midpoint rule with more intervals. Alternatively, use the fact that the integral is zero. But why does the substitution work? Let me check with another substitution. Suppose we let u = x + cosx. Then du/dx = 1 - sinx. But that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts. Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = cos(x + cosx), dv = dx. Then du/dx = -sin(x + cosx)(1 - sinx), and v = x. So integration by parts gives uv|₀^π - ∫₀^π v du. That would be x cos(x + cosx)|₀^π - ∫₀^π x*(-sin(x + cosx)(1 - sinx)) dx. But this seems more complicated. The first term is π cos(π + cosπ) - 0*cos(0 + cos0) = π cos(π -1) ≈ π*(-0.4161). The second term is + ∫₀^π x sin(x + cosx)(1 - sinx) dx. This doesn't seem helpful. So maybe integration by parts isn't the way to go. Alternatively, maybe expanding the cosine into a series. Let's consider expanding cos(x + cosx) using the cosine addition formula: cos(x + cosx) = cosx cos(cosx) - sinx sin(cosx). But integrating this term by term from 0 to π. Let's see: ∫₀^π [cosx cos(cosx) - sinx sin(cosx)] dx. Split into two integrals: ∫₀^π cosx cos(cosx) dx - ∫₀^π sinx sin(cosx) dx. Let's look at the first integral: ∫ cosx cos(cosx) dx. Let me substitute u = sinx. Then du = cosx dx. Wait, but the integrand is cosx cos(cosx) dx. Let me set u = cosx. Then du = -sinx dx. Hmm, not directly helpful. Alternatively, notice that d/dx sin(cosx) = -sinx cos(cosx). Wait, no: d/dx sin(cosx) = cos(cosx) * (-sinx). So ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx = -sin(cosx) + C. Wait, let's check: derivative of sin(cosx) is cos(cosx)*(-sinx). So ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx = -∫ d/dx [sin(cosx)] dx = -sin(cosx) + C. Therefore, the second integral ∫₀^π sinx sin(cosx) dx = -sin(cosx)|₀^π = -[sin(cosπ) - sin(cos0)] = -[sin(-1) - sin(1)] = -[-sin(1) - sin(1)] = -[-2 sin(1)] = 2 sin(1). 

Now, the first integral: ∫₀^π cosx cos(cosx) dx. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of a known function. Let me try substitution u = sinx. Then du = cosx dx. But the integrand is cosx cos(cosx) dx = cos(cosx) d(sinx). Not sure. Alternatively, substitution v = cosx. Then dv = -sinx dx. But the integrand is cosx cos(cosx) dx. Hmm. Alternatively, notice that d/dx sin(cosx) = -sinx cos(cosx), which we already used. But here we have cosx cos(cosx). Maybe integrating by parts. Let me set u = cos(cosx), dv = cosx dx. Then du = sin(cosx) sinx dx, and v = sinx. So integration by parts gives uv|₀^π - ∫₀^π v du = sinx cos(cosx)|₀^π - ∫₀^π sinx * sin(cosx) sinx dx. Wait, that's complicated. The first term is [sinπ cos(cosπ) - sin0 cos(cos0)] = [0*cos(-1) - 0*cos(1)] = 0. The second integral is -∫₀^π sin²x sin(cosx) dx. So the first integral becomes -∫₀^π sin²x sin(cosx) dx. But this seems more complicated. So maybe this approach isn't helpful. 

Going back, the original integral after expansion is ∫₀^π cosx cos(cosx) dx - ∫₀^π sinx sin(cosx) dx. We already found that the second integral is 2 sin(1). The first integral is still problematic. But if we can express the first integral in terms of known functions or relate it to the second integral. Alternatively, perhaps the first integral is zero. Let me check. Let's substitute x = π - t in the first integral. Let’s try substitution t = π - x. Then when x=0, t=π; x=π, t=0. The integral becomes ∫₀^π cos(π - t) cos(cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫₀^π (-cos t) cos(-cos t) dt. Since cos is even, cos(-cos t) = cos(cos t). So the integral becomes -∫₀^π cos t cos(cos t) dt. Which is -I1, where I1 is the first integral. Therefore, I1 = -I1 => 2I1 =0 => I1=0. Therefore, the first integral is zero. Therefore, the original integral becomes 0 - 2 sin(1) = -2 sin(1). Wait, but this contradicts the previous substitution result where the integral was zero. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify. 

Wait, the original integral after expansion was I = I1 - I2, where I1 = ∫ cosx cos(cosx) dx and I2 = ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx. We found that I2 = 2 sin(1). Then, using substitution, we found that I1 =0. Therefore, I = 0 - 2 sin(1) = -2 sin(1). But this contradicts the previous substitution where I =0. So there must be a mistake here. 

Wait, where is the mistake? Let me check the expansion. The original integrand is cos(x + cosx). Using the cosine addition formula: cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So cos(x + cosx) = cosx cos(cosx) - sinx sin(cosx). Therefore, the integral I = ∫₀^π [cosx cos(cosx) - sinx sin(cosx)] dx = I1 - I2. Then, I1 = ∫ cosx cos(cosx) dx from 0 to π. Then, using substitution t = π -x, we found I1 = -I1 => I1=0. Then I2 = 2 sin(1). Therefore, I = 0 - 2 sin(1) = -2 sin(1). But earlier substitution suggested I=0. So which is correct? There's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that there's an error in one of the steps. Let me check the substitution for I1. I1 = ∫₀^π cosx cos(cosx) dx. Substitute t = π -x. Then, dx = -dt. The integral becomes ∫₀^π cos(π - t) cos(cos(π - t)) (-dt) = ∫₀^π (-cos t) cos(-cos t) dt. Since cos(-cos t) = cos(cos t), this becomes -∫₀^π cos t cos(cos t) dt = -I1. Therefore, I1 = -I1 => 2I1=0 => I1=0. So that's correct. Then I2 = ∫₀^π sinx sin(cosx) dx. We computed this as 2 sin(1). Let me verify that again. The integral of sinx sin(cosx) dx from 0 to π. Let u = cosx, then du = -sinx dx. So the integral becomes -∫_{1}^{-1} sin(cosx) du. Wait, but u = cosx, so when x=0, u=1; x=π, u=-1. So the integral is -∫_{1}^{-1} sin(u) du = ∫_{-1}^{1} sin(u) du = [ -cos(u) ]_{-1}^1 = (-cos1) - (-cos(-1)) = -cos1 + cos1 = 0. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Wait, what's happening here. Let me redo this. 

Compute I2 = ∫₀^π sinx sin(cosx) dx. Let u = cosx, then du = -sinx dx. So, -du = sinx dx. Therefore, I2 = ∫₀^π sin(cosx) sinx dx = ∫_{u=1}^{u=-1} sin(u) (-du) = ∫_{-1}^{1} sin(u) du = [ -cos(u) ]_{-1}^1 = (-cos1) - (-cos(-1)) = -cos1 + cos1 = 0. Because cos(-1) = cos1. Therefore, I2 =0. Wait, but earlier I thought I2=2 sin(1). That was a mistake. So where did that mistake come from? Earlier, I thought that ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx = -sin(cosx) + C, but that's incorrect. Let me check. Let’s differentiate -sin(cosx): d/dx [-sin(cosx)] = -cos(cosx)*(-sinx) = sinx cos(cosx). But the integrand is sinx sin(cosx). Therefore, integrating sinx sin(cosx) dx is not be equal to -sin(cosx). Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. The correct substitution is u = cosx, du = -sinx dx. Therefore, ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx = -∫ sin(cosx) (-sinx dx) = -∫ sinu du = cosu + C = cos(cosx) + C. Wait, no. Wait, let me do it step by step. Let’s set u = cosx, then du = -sinx dx. So, ∫ sinx sin(cosx) dx = ∫ -sin(cosx) (-sinx dx) = ∫ -sinu du = ∫ -sinu du = cosu + C = cos(cosx) + C. Therefore, the definite integral from 0 to π is [cos(cosπ) - cos(cos0)] = cos(-1) - cos(1) = cos1 - cos1 =0. Because cos is even, so cos(-1)=cos1. Therefore, I2=0. Therefore, the original integral I = I1 - I2 =0 -0=0. So that matches the substitution result. Therefore, the integral is indeed zero. 

So where was the mistake in the previous calculation? Earlier, I thought that the integral of sinx sin(cosx) dx was -sin(cosx) evaluated from 0 to π, which is incorrect. The correct antiderivative is cos(cosx), leading to zero. Therefore, both I1 and I2 are zero, leading to I=0. Therefore, the analytical result is zero. The previous numerical approximations were not accurate enough, but with higher precision, the integral should approach zero. 

To confirm, let's use a more accurate numerical method. For example, using a calculator or computational tool. Let me approximate the integral numerically with higher precision. Let's use the midpoint rule with a large number of intervals. For example, take n=1000 intervals. The midpoint rule approximates the integral as h * sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i), where x_i is the midpoint of each interval. The step size h = π/1000 ≈0.0031416. Compute the sum of f(x_i) for i=1 to 1000, then multiply by h. However, doing this manually is impractical, but I can reason that if the integral is zero, the positive and negative areas cancel out. Given the symmetry via substitution, the integral is indeed zero. Therefore, the exact answer is zero, and any numerical approximation should approach zero as the number of intervals increases. The previous approximations with few intervals showed small positive values due to the function's behavior, but with more intervals, the approximation would get closer to zero. 

Therefore, the definite integral ∫₀^π cos(x + cosx) dx is exactly zero, and the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
