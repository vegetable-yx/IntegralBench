Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral of x³ divided by (3 + 2x²) squared, from 0 to 1. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe substitution would work here. The denominator is (3 + 2x²)², and the numerator is x³. Let me try letting u = 3 + 2x². Then, the derivative du/dx would be 4x. Wait, but the numerator has x³. Let me check: if u = 3 + 2x², then du = 4x dx. So, x dx is du/4. But the numerator is x³, which is x² times x. Hmm, maybe I can express x² in terms of u. Since u = 3 + 2x², then x² = (u - 3)/2. So, x³ would be x * x², which is x*(u - 3)/2. But x dx is du/4, so maybe I can manipulate this.

Wait, let's write the integral as ∫ x³ / (3 + 2x²)² dx. Let me split the x³ into x * x². Then, substitute u = 3 + 2x², so du = 4x dx, which means x dx = du/4. Then, x² is (u - 3)/2. So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ [ (u - 3)/2 ] * [ x dx ] / u². But x dx is du/4, so substituting that in, we get ∫ [ (u - 3)/2 ] * (du/4) / u². Let me simplify that.

Multiply the constants: (1/2)*(1/4) = 1/8. So, (1/8) ∫ (u - 3)/u² du. Then, split the fraction: (u - 3)/u² = u/u² - 3/u² = 1/u - 3/u². So the integral becomes (1/8) ∫ (1/u - 3/u²) du. Integrating term by term: ∫1/u du is ln|u|, and ∫3/u² du is 3*(-1/u). So, putting it together: (1/8)[ ln|u| + 3/u ] + C. Substitute back u = 3 + 2x²: (1/8)[ ln(3 + 2x²) + 3/(3 + 2x²) ] + C.

Now, evaluate from 0 to 1. Let's compute at upper limit 1: (1/8)[ ln(3 + 2*1²) + 3/(3 + 2*1²) ] = (1/8)[ ln(5) + 3/5 ]. At lower limit 0: (1/8)[ ln(3 + 0) + 3/(3 + 0) ] = (1/8)[ ln(3) + 1 ]. Subtract the lower limit from the upper limit: (1/8)[ ln(5) + 3/5 - ln(3) - 1 ].

Simplify the expression: (1/8)[ (ln(5) - ln(3)) + (3/5 - 1) ] = (1/8)[ ln(5/3) - 2/5 ]. So the exact answer is (1/8)(ln(5/3) - 2/5). Let me check if that's correct. Wait, when I substituted back, the integral from 0 to1 would be [ (1/8)(ln(5) + 3/5) ] - [ (1/8)(ln(3) + 1) ] = (1/8)(ln(5) - ln(3) + 3/5 -1) = (1/8)(ln(5/3) - 2/5). Yes, that seems right.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. First, compute ln(5/3). Natural logarithm of 5/3 is approximately ln(1.6666667) ≈ 0.510825624. Then subtract 2/5, which is 0.4. So 0.510825624 - 0.4 = 0.110825624. Multiply by 1/8: 0.110825624 / 8 ≈ 0.013853203. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's approximately 0.013853203. Let me verify with a calculator.

Alternatively, compute each part step by step. Let me check ln(5) ≈ 1.609437912, ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289. So ln(5) - ln(3) ≈ 0.510825623. Then 3/5 is 0.6, so 0.6 -1 = -0.4. So 0.510825623 -0.4 = 0.110825623. Multiply by 1/8: 0.110825623 /8 ≈ 0.013853203. So the numerical value is approximately 0.013853203, which rounds to 0.0138532030 when keeping 10 decimal places. Wait, but maybe I should check with more precise calculations.

Alternatively, use a calculator for the exact integral. Let me compute the exact expression: (ln(5/3) - 2/5)/8. Let me compute ln(5/3):

ln(5) ≈ 1.6094379124341003

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986122886681098

ln(5/3) = ln(5) - ln(3) ≈ 1.6094379124341003 - 1.0986122886681098 ≈ 0.5108256237659905

Then subtract 2/5 = 0.4: 0.5108256237659905 - 0.4 = 0.1108256237659905

Divide by 8: 0.1108256237659905 / 8 ≈ 0.013853202970748813

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.01385320297. So approximately 0.0138532030 when rounded to 10 decimals. But let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, compute using decimal expansions:

0.5108256237659905 - 0.4 = 0.1108256237659905

Divide by 8: 0.1108256237659905 ÷ 8 = 0.0138532029707488125

So, to 10 decimal places, that's 0.01385320297. But when rounded, the 11th decimal is 0.000000000008, so it's 0.01385320297. Wait, but 0.0138532029707488125, the 10th decimal is the 2nd 0 after the decimal: 0.01385320297... So the 10th decimal place is the 7th digit after the decimal? Wait, no. Let's count:

0.01385320297

Decimal places:

1: 0

2: 1

3: 3

4: 8

5: 5

6: 3

7: 2

8: 0

9: 2

10:9

11:7

So the 10th decimal is the 9th digit after the decimal, which is 2. Wait, no. Wait, the first decimal place is the first digit after the decimal. So 0.0 (1) 3 8 5 3 2 0 2 9 7...

Wait, let's write it out:

0.01385320297

Breaking it down:

0.0 (1st)

1 (2nd)

3 (3rd)

8 (4th)

5 (5th)

3 (6th)

2 (7th)

0 (8th)

2 (9th)

9 (10th)

7 (11th)

So the 10th decimal place is the 9th digit here? Wait, no. Wait, 0.01385320297 is 0.01385320297, so:

Position: 1: 0

2: 1

3: 3

4: 8

5:5

6:3

7:2

8:0

9:2

10:9

11:7

So the 10th decimal digit is 9. So when rounding to 10 decimal places, we look at the 11th digit, which is 7. Since 7 >=5, we round up the 10th digit from 9 to 10, which would carry over. Wait, 0.01385320297 rounded to 10 decimal places:

The number is 0.01385320297. The 10th decimal is 9 (the 10th digit after the decimal). The next digit is 7, so we round up 9 to 10, which increments the previous digit. So 0.01385320297 becomes 0.0138532030 (with the 9 becoming 10, so 2 becomes 3, and the 9 becomes 0 with a carryover). Wait, let me check:

Original number: 0.01385320297

Breaking down:

Digits after decimal: 0,1,3,8,5,3,2,0,2,9,7

So positions 1-10: 0,1,3,8,5,3,2,0,2,9

The 10th digit is 9. The 11th digit is 7. So when rounding to 10 decimal places, we add 1 to the 10th digit, making it 9 +1 =10. So the 10th digit becomes 0, and we add 1 to the 9th digit (which is 2). So 2 becomes 3, and the 10th digit is 0. So the rounded number is 0.0138532030. So the numerical approximation is 0.0138532030.

Wait, but let me confirm with a calculator. Alternatively, compute the integral numerically using another method. Let's compute the integral from 0 to1 of x³/(3+2x²)^2 dx.

Alternatively, use substitution again. Let me check if my analytical result is correct. Let me differentiate the antiderivative to see if I get back the original function.

The antiderivative is (1/8)(ln(3 + 2x²) + 3/(3 + 2x²)). Let's differentiate this with respect to x.

Derivative of ln(3 + 2x²) is (4x)/(3 + 2x²). Wait, no. Wait, derivative of ln(u) is (u')/u. So u = 3 + 2x², u' = 4x. So derivative is (4x)/(3 + 2x²). Then, derivative of 3/(3 + 2x²) is 3*(-1)*(4x)/(3 + 2x²)^2. So combining, the derivative of the antiderivative is (1/8)[ (4x)/(3 + 2x²) - (12x)/(3 + 2x²)^2 ].

Factor out 4x/(3 + 2x²)^2: (4x)/(3 + 2x²)^2 [ (3 + 2x²) - 3 ] / 8. Simplify inside the brackets: (3 + 2x² -3) = 2x². So we have (4x * 2x²)/(8*(3 + 2x²)^2) = (8x³)/(8*(3 + 2x²)^2) = x³/(3 + 2x²)^2. Which matches the original integrand. So the antiderivative is correct. Therefore, the exact answer is correct.

So the exact answer is (ln(5/3) - 2/5)/8, which can be written as \frac{1}{8}\left( \ln\left( \frac{5}{3} \right) - \frac{2}{5} \right). In LaTeX, that's \boxed{\dfrac{1}{8} \left( \ln\left( \dfrac{5}{3} \right) - \dfrac{2}{5} \right)}.

The numerical approximation, as calculated, is approximately 0.0138532030 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
