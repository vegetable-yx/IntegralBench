Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x) * arccos(x) * arcsin²(x) dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me start by recalling some integration techniques that might help here. The integrand has three functions multiplied together: 1/x, arccos(x), and arcsin²(x). That's a lot. Maybe substitution or integration by parts?

First, let me note that arccos(x) and arcsin(x) are related. Since arccos(x) = π/2 - arcsin(x), maybe I can express everything in terms of arcsin(x) to simplify. Let's try that substitution. Let’s set t = arcsin(x). Then, x = sin(t), and dx = cos(t) dt. Also, when x=0, t=0, and when x=1, t=π/2. So the limits of integration become 0 to π/2. Let's substitute these into the integral.

Original integral: ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) arcsin²(x) dx

Substituting t = arcsin(x), so x = sin(t), dx = cos(t) dt. Then, arccos(x) = π/2 - t, and arcsin(x) = t. Also, 1/x becomes 1/sin(t). So substituting all:

Integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [1/sin(t)] * (π/2 - t) * t² * cos(t) dt

Simplify that: ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) * t² * [cos(t)/sin(t)] dt

Which is ∫₀^{π/2} (π/2 - t) t² cot(t) dt

Hmm, cot(t) is cos(t)/sin(t), so that's correct. Now, the integrand is (π/2 - t) t² cot(t). This still looks challenging. Maybe expanding the product (π/2 - t) t²? Let's see:

(π/2 - t) t² = π/2 t² - t³

So the integral becomes:

π/2 ∫₀^{π/2} t² cot(t) dt - ∫₀^{π/2} t³ cot(t) dt

So now we have two integrals: I1 = ∫ t² cot(t) dt and I2 = ∫ t³ cot(t) dt. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with I1 = ∫ t² cot(t) dt. Integration by parts might be useful here. Let me recall that ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. Let’s set u = t², dv = cot(t) dt. Then du = 2t dt, and v = ∫ cot(t) dt. The integral of cot(t) dt is ln|sin(t)|. So v = ln(sin(t)) (since t is between 0 and π/2, sin(t) is positive).

So applying integration by parts to I1:

I1 = u v - ∫ v du = t² ln(sin(t)) - ∫ 2t ln(sin(t)) dt

So I1 evaluated from 0 to π/2 is [t² ln(sin(t))]₀^{π/2} - 2 ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt

Now, evaluating the first term at the limits: at t=π/2, sin(π/2)=1, so ln(1)=0, so the upper limit is 0. At t=0, sin(0)=0, so ln(0) is -infinity, but multiplied by t² which is 0. So the term [t² ln(sin(t))] from 0 to π/2 is 0 - 0 = 0. Therefore, I1 = -2 ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt

Hmm, so now we need to compute ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt. I remember that there are known integrals involving t ln(sin(t)). Let me recall. The integral ∫₀^{π/2} ln(sin(t)) dt is known to be - (π/2) ln(2). But here we have an extra t term. Maybe using Fourier series or series expansion for ln(sin(t))?

Alternatively, perhaps another integration by parts. Let’s set u = t, dv = ln(sin(t)) dt. Then du = dt, and v = ∫ ln(sin(t)) dt. Wait, but integrating ln(sin(t)) is non-trivial. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe use the expansion of ln(sin(t)).

I recall that ln(sin(t)) can be written as -ln(2) - Σ_{n=1}^∞ cos(2nt)/n for 0 < t < π. So maybe expanding that and integrating term by term.

So, ln(sin(t)) = -ln(2) - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (cos(2nt))/n

Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} t [ -ln(2) - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (cos(2nt))/n ] dt

= -ln(2) ∫₀^{π/2} t dt - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) ∫₀^{π/2} t cos(2nt) dt

Compute each integral separately. First integral: ∫₀^{π/2} t dt = (1/2)(π/2)^2 = π²/8

Second integral: ∫₀^{π/2} t cos(2nt) dt. Integration by parts. Let u = t, dv = cos(2nt) dt. Then du = dt, v = (1/(2n)) sin(2nt)

So uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫ v du = [ t/(2n) sin(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} (1/(2n)) sin(2nt) dt

First term: At π/2: (π/2)/(2n) sin(2n*(π/2)) = (π/(4n)) sin(nπ) = 0 since sin(nπ)=0. At 0: 0. So the first term is 0.

Second term: -1/(2n) ∫ sin(2nt) dt = -1/(2n) [ -1/(2n) cos(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} = 1/(4n²) [ cos(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} = 1/(4n²) [ cos(nπ) - cos(0) ] = 1/(4n²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ]

Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} t cos(2nt) dt = 1/(4n²) [ (-1)^n - 1 ]

Putting back into the sum:

Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) * [1/(4n²) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ] = (1/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ ( (-1)^n -1 ) / n³ ]

So the entire expression for the integral:

- ln(2) * (π²/8) - (1/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ ( (-1)^n -1 ) / n³ ]

Let’s compute the sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ ( (-1)^n -1 ) / n³ ] = Σ_{n=1}^∞ [ (-1)^n / n³ - 1/n³ ] = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n³ - Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n³

We know that Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n³ = - (1 - 2^{1-3}) ζ(3) = - (1 - 1/4) ζ(3) = - (3/4) ζ(3). Wait, actually, the Dirichlet eta function η(s) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^s = (1 - 2^{1-s}) ζ(s). So η(3) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n³ = (1 - 2^{-2}) ζ(3) = (3/4) ζ(3). Therefore, Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n /n³ = - η(3) = - (3/4) ζ(3). And Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n³ = ζ(3). Therefore, the sum becomes:

- (3/4) ζ(3) - ζ(3) = - (7/4) ζ(3)

Therefore, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt = - ln(2) * π²/8 - (1/4)( -7/4 ζ(3) ) = - (π²/8) ln(2) + (7/16) ζ(3)

Therefore, going back to I1:

I1 = -2 [ - (π²/8) ln(2) + (7/16) ζ(3) ] = (π²/4) ln(2) - (7/8) ζ(3)

Okay, so that's I1. Now, moving on to I2 = ∫₀^{π/2} t³ cot(t) dt. Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Let's try integration by parts again. Let’s set u = t³, dv = cot(t) dt. Then du = 3t² dt, and v = ln(sin(t)) as before.

So I2 = u v |₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} v du = [ t³ ln(sin(t)) ]₀^{π/2} - 3 ∫₀^{π/2} t² ln(sin(t)) dt

Again, evaluating the first term: at π/2, ln(sin(π/2))=0, multiplied by t³= (π/2)^3, so 0. At 0, t³ ln(sin(t)) approaches 0 (since t³ goes to 0 and ln(sin(t)) ~ ln(t) which goes to -infinity, but t³ ln(t) approaches 0). So the first term is 0. Therefore, I2 = -3 ∫₀^{π/2} t² ln(sin(t)) dt

Wait, but we already computed ∫₀^{π/2} t ln(sin(t)) dt earlier. But here it's t². Hmm, so we need to compute ∫ t² ln(sin(t)) dt. This seems more complex. Let me think. Maybe using the same expansion for ln(sin(t)) as before.

So, ln(sin(t)) = -ln(2) - Σ_{n=1}^∞ cos(2nt)/n

Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} t² ln(sin(t)) dt = ∫₀^{π/2} t² [ -ln(2) - Σ_{n=1}^∞ cos(2nt)/n ] dt

= -ln(2) ∫₀^{π/2} t² dt - Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) ∫₀^{π/2} t² cos(2nt) dt

First integral: ∫ t² dt from 0 to π/2 is (1/3)(π/2)^3 = π³/24

Second integral: ∫₀^{π/2} t² cos(2nt) dt. Hmm, this requires integration by parts. Let’s set u = t², dv = cos(2nt) dt. Then du = 2t dt, v = (1/(2n)) sin(2nt)

So, uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫ v du = [ t²/(2n) sin(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} - ∫₀^{π/2} (1/(2n)) sin(2nt) * 2t dt

First term: At π/2, sin(2n*(π/2)) = sin(nπ) = 0. At 0, sin(0) = 0. So the first term is 0. The remaining integral is - (1/n) ∫₀^{π/2} t sin(2nt) dt

Now, compute ∫ t sin(2nt) dt. Again, integration by parts. Let u = t, dv = sin(2nt) dt. Then du = dt, v = -1/(2n) cos(2nt)

So, uv|₀^{π/2} - ∫ v du = [ -t/(2n) cos(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} + 1/(2n) ∫ cos(2nt) dt

First term: At π/2: - (π/2)/(2n) cos(2n*(π/2)) = - π/(4n) cos(nπ) = - π/(4n) (-1)^n

At 0: -0/(2n) cos(0) = 0

Second term: 1/(2n) ∫ cos(2nt) dt = 1/(2n) [ (1/(2n)) sin(2nt) ]₀^{π/2} = 1/(4n²) [ sin(nπ) - sin(0) ] = 0

Therefore, ∫ t sin(2nt) dt = - π/(4n) (-1)^n + 0 = π (-1)^{n+1}/(4n)

Therefore, going back, the integral ∫₀^{π/2} t² cos(2nt) dt = - (1/n) * [ π (-1)^{n+1}/(4n) ] = π (-1)^n/(4n²)

Wait, let me check the signs again. The integral ∫ t sin(2nt) dt was equal to π (-1)^{n+1}/(4n). Then multiplied by -1/n:

- (1/n) * [ π (-1)^{n+1}/(4n) ] = - π (-1)^{n+1}/(4n²) = π (-1)^{n+2}/(4n²) = π (-1)^n/(4n²)

Wait, (-1)^{n+2} = (-1)^n * (-1)^2 = (-1)^n * 1 = (-1)^n. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, ∫₀^{π/2} t² cos(2nt) dt = π (-1)^n/(4n²)

Therefore, the sum Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n) * [ π (-1)^n/(4n²) ] = (π/4) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n³

Which is (π/4) * [ - η(3) ] = (π/4) * [ - (3/4) ζ(3) ] = - (3π/16) ζ(3)

Therefore, putting back into the original expression:

∫₀^{π/2} t² ln(sin(t)) dt = - ln(2) * π³/24 - ( -3π/16 ζ(3) ) = - (π³/24) ln(2) + (3π/16) ζ(3)

Therefore, I2 = -3 [ - (π³/24) ln(2) + (3π/16) ζ(3) ] = 3*(π³/24) ln(2) - 9π/16 ζ(3) = (π³/8) ln(2) - (9π/16) ζ(3)

So now, going back to the original integral:

Original integral = π/2 * I1 - I2

= π/2 [ (π²/4) ln(2) - (7/8) ζ(3) ] - [ (π³/8) ln(2) - (9π/16) ζ(3) ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: π/2 * (π²/4) ln(2) = (π³/8) ln(2)

Second term: π/2 * (-7/8 ζ(3)) = -7π/16 ζ(3)

Third term: - (π³/8) ln(2)

Fourth term: - (-9π/16 ζ(3)) = +9π/16 ζ(3)

So adding all terms:

(π³/8 ln2 - π³/8 ln2) + (-7π/16 ζ3 +9π/16 ζ3) = 0 + (2π/16 ζ3) = π/8 ζ(3)

Wait, that's interesting. The terms with ln(2) cancel out, and the ζ(3) terms combine to (2π/16) ζ(3) = π/8 ζ(3)

So the original integral is π/8 ζ(3)

Wait, that's the exact answer? So the integral from 0 to 1 of (1/x) arccos(x) arcsin²(x) dx equals π/8 times the Riemann zeta function at 3.

But ζ(3) is Apery's constant, approximately 1.2020569032...

Therefore, the exact answer is (π ζ(3))/8, and the numerical approximation would be (3.1415926535... * 1.2020569032)/8 ≈ (3.77463766)/8 ≈ 0.4718297075...

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

First, π ≈ 3.141592653589793

ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569031595942854

Multiply them: 3.141592653589793 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈

Let me compute this step by step:

3 * 1.2020569031595942854 = 3.6061707094787828562

0.141592653589793 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈

First, 0.1 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈ 0.12020569031595942854

0.041592653589793 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈

Compute 0.04 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈ 0.048082276126383771416

0.001592653589793 * 1.2020569031595942854 ≈ ~0.001592653589793 * 1.20205690316 ≈ 0.001914

So total ≈ 0.1202056903 + 0.0480822761 + 0.001914 ≈ 0.1702019664

Therefore, total π * ζ(3) ≈ 3.6061707095 + 0.1702019664 ≈ 3.7763726759

Divide by 8: 3.7763726759 / 8 ≈ 0.4720465844875

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 0.4720465845

But let me check with a calculator for more accurate multiplication:

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

ζ(3) ≈ 1.202056903159594

Multiply: 3.141592653589793 * 1.202056903159594

= 3.141592653589793 * 1.202056903159594

Let me compute this using more precise steps:

First, 3 * 1.202056903159594 = 3.606170709478782

0.141592653589793 * 1.202056903159594

Break down 0.1 * 1.202056903159594 = 0.1202056903159594

0.04 * 1.202056903159594 = 0.04808227612638376

0.001592653589793 * 1.202056903159594 ≈ 0.001592653589793 * 1.20205690316 ≈ 0.001914

Adding those: 0.1202056903159594 + 0.04808227612638376 = 0.16828796644234316 + 0.001914 ≈ 0.17020196644234316

So total π * ζ(3) ≈ 3.606170709478782 + 0.17020196644234316 ≈ 3.776372675921125

Divide by 8: 3.776372675921125 / 8 = 0.4720465844901406

So approximately 0.4720465845 when rounded to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the exact answer is (π ζ(3))/8, and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.4720465845.

Let me verify if there's any mistake in the steps. The key steps were substitution t = arcsin(x), leading to the integral in terms of t, splitting into I1 and I2, integrating by parts, expanding ln(sin(t)) into a Fourier series, computing the integrals term by term, and then combining everything. The cancellation of the ln(2) terms was crucial, leading to the final result involving ζ(3). It seems correct. Also, the numerical value matches known results? I recall that similar integrals involving ζ(3) and π can result in such values. So I think the answer is correct.
