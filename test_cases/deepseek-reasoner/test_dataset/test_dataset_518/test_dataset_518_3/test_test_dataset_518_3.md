Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2018π of the absolute value of sin(2018x) dx. Hmm, integrating an absolute value function can be tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or a periodicity I can use.

First, I remember that the integral of |sin(ax)| over a full period is a known value. The function |sin(ax)| has a period of π/a because the regular sin(ax) has a period of 2π/a, but taking the absolute value reflects the negative parts, making the period half. So each period is π/a. 

In this case, a is 2018. So the period of |sin(2018x)| should be π/2018. That means over each interval of length π/2018, the function repeats its behavior. Now, the integral over one period would be the same as integrating from 0 to π/2018, and then multiplied by the number of periods in the interval from 0 to 2018π.

Wait, let me check that. The total interval length is 2018π. Each period is π/2018. So the number of periods is (2018π) / (π/2018) = (2018π) * (2018/π) = 2018². That's a lot of periods. So the integral over the entire interval would be the integral over one period multiplied by 2018².

But what's the integral of |sin(2018x)| over one period? Let's compute that. Let me make a substitution to simplify. Let u = 2018x. Then du = 2018 dx, so dx = du/2018. When x goes from 0 to π/2018, u goes from 0 to π. So the integral over one period is ∫₀^π |sin(u)| * (du/2018). The integral of |sin(u)| from 0 to π is 2, because sin(u) is positive in [0, π], so the integral is the same as ∫₀^π sin(u) du = 2. Therefore, the integral over one period is 2/2018.

Wait, but hold on. If the period is π/2018, then the substitution gives us (1/2018) times ∫₀^π |sin(u)| du. Since ∫₀^π |sin(u)| du is 2, then the integral over one period is 2/2018. Then, multiplying by the number of periods, which is 2018², gives the total integral as (2/2018) * 2018² = 2*2018. So the exact answer would be 2*2018, which is 4036. But let me verify this step by step to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the integral of |sin(kx)| from 0 to Nπ, where N is an integer. Let's see. For k=2018 and Nπ=2018π, so N=2018. Wait, but the upper limit here is 2018π. Let me think again. If I have the integral from 0 to T of |sin(kx)| dx. Let’s set k=2018 and T=2018π. Then, the substitution u = kx, so du = k dx, dx = du/k. Then the integral becomes (1/k) ∫₀^{k*T} |sin(u)| du. Wait, but k*T would be 2018*2018π, which is 2018² π. Wait, that seems different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, original integral is from 0 to 2018π of |sin(2018x)| dx. Let me make substitution u = 2018x. Then, when x=0, u=0; when x=2018π, u=2018*2018π = 2018² π. So the integral becomes (1/2018) ∫₀^{2018² π} |sin(u)| du. Now, the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to nπ, where n is an integer, is 2n. Because each period π contributes 2. So here, n is 2018². Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2018) * 2 * 2018² ) = (1/2018)*(2*2018²) = 2*2018. So that's 4036. So the exact answer is 4036. 

But let me check with a smaller number to see if the logic holds. Suppose we have integral from 0 to 2π of |sin(2x)| dx. Then, substitution u=2x, du=2dx, dx=du/2. The integral becomes (1/2) ∫₀^{4π} |sin(u)| du. The integral of |sin(u)| from 0 to 4π is 8 (since each π interval contributes 2, so 4π would be 4*2=8). So (1/2)*8=4. Alternatively, the number of periods in 0 to 2π for sin(2x) is 2 periods (since period is π). So each period contributes 2, so 2*2=4. So that works. So the same logic applies here. So the answer is 2*2018=4036. 

Therefore, the exact answer is 4036. The numerical approximation is 4036.0000000000. But wait, 4036 is an integer, so the numerical approximation is exactly 4036. So when rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 4036.0000000000. 

So the steps are: recognize the integral of |sin(kx)| over 0 to Nπ where N is integer, use substitution to find the integral over each period, multiply by the number of periods, and compute. The exact answer is 4036, numerical is 4036.0.
