Okay, so I need to solve the definite integral from 420 to 1672 of sqrt(ln(2023 - x)) divided by [sqrt(ln(2023 - x)) + sqrt(ln(x - 69))] dx. Hmm, let's see. The problem says to compute it analytically first. Alright, let me start by understanding the structure here.

First, the integrand is a fraction where both the numerator and denominator involve square roots of logarithms. The limits of integration are from 420 to 1672. Let me note that 2023 - x and x - 69 are inside the logarithms. Let me check the domain to make sure the arguments of the logarithms are positive. For x in [420, 1672], 2023 - x would range from 2023 - 420 = 1603 down to 2023 - 1672 = 351. Both are positive, so ln(2023 - x) is defined. Similarly, x - 69 would range from 420 - 69 = 351 up to 1672 - 69 = 1603. So both arguments inside the logarithms are positive throughout the interval. Good, no domain issues here.

Now, the integrand is symmetric-looking in a way. The denominator has sqrt(ln(2023 - x)) + sqrt(ln(x - 69)), and the numerator is sqrt(ln(2023 - x)). This reminds me of integrals where substitution can be used by exploiting symmetry. Maybe a substitution like x = a + b - t? Let's see. Let me check the substitution where I replace x with something that swaps 2023 - x and x - 69. Let's see, if I let t = 2023 - (x - 69) = 2023 - x + 69 = 2092 - x. Wait, but the limits when x=420, t=2092 - 420 = 1672, and when x=1672, t=2092 - 1672 = 420. So the substitution t = 2092 - x would flip the limits of integration from 420 to 1672 into 1672 to 420. But integrating from a to b and then flipping the limits would introduce a negative sign. Let me write that substitution properly.

Let me set t = 2023 - (x - 69) + 69? Wait, maybe a better approach. Let me think. Let me set t = 2023 - x + 69. Wait, 2023 - x is part of the first logarithm, and x - 69 is the other. If I set t such that when x is in the lower limit, t is in the upper limit and vice versa. Let me check the sum of the lower and upper limits: 420 + 1672 = 2092. So maybe t = 2092 - x. Let's test that. If x = 420, then t = 2092 - 420 = 1672. If x = 1672, then t = 2092 - 1672 = 420. So substituting t = 2092 - x swaps the limits. Then, dx = -dt. So the integral becomes the integral from t=1672 to t=420 of [sqrt(ln(2023 - (2092 - t))) / (sqrt(ln(2023 - (2092 - t))) + sqrt(ln((2092 - t) - 69)))] * (-dt). Then flipping the limits, it becomes the integral from 420 to 1672 of [sqrt(ln(2023 - 2092 + t)) / (sqrt(ln(2023 - 2092 + t)) + sqrt(ln(2092 - t - 69)))] dt.

Simplify the expressions inside the logarithms. Let's compute 2023 - 2092 + t: 2023 - 2092 = -69, so that's t - 69. Then 2092 - t - 69 = 2023 - t. So the integrand becomes sqrt(ln(t - 69)) / [sqrt(ln(t - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - t))]. So the original integral, let's call it I, is equal to the integral from 420 to 1672 of sqrt(ln(t - 69)) / [sqrt(ln(t - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - t))] dt. But since t is a dummy variable, we can write I = ∫_{420}^{1672} [sqrt(ln(x - 69)) / (sqrt(ln(x - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - x)))] dx.

So now, if we add the original integral I and the transformed integral, we get:

I + I = ∫_{420}^{1672} [sqrt(ln(2023 - x)) + sqrt(ln(x - 69))] / [sqrt(ln(2023 - x)) + sqrt(ln(x - 69))] dx

Which simplifies to ∫_{420}^{1672} 1 dx = 1672 - 420 = 1252. Therefore, 2I = 1252, so I = 1252 / 2 = 626. Wait, 1672 - 420 is 1252, so 2I = 1252, so I = 626. So the exact value of the integral is 626.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify again. The substitution t = 2092 - x, which swaps the limits. Then the transformed integrand becomes sqrt(ln(t - 69)) / [sqrt(ln(t - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - t))]. Then adding the original integrand and the transformed one gives 1. Therefore, the integral of 1 over the interval is the length of the interval, which is 1672 - 420 = 1252. Therefore, 2I = 1252, so I = 626. That seems correct. So the exact answer is 626. Then the numerical approximation is 626.0000000000. But let me check if there's any mistake here.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. Let me do it step by step. Let me define t = 2023 - (x - 69). Wait, x - 69 is part of the second logarithm. If I set t = 2023 - (x - 69), then t = 2023 - x + 69 = 2092 - x. So that's the same substitution as before. So when x = 420, t = 1672, and when x = 1672, t = 420. So the substitution is correct. Then, the integrand becomes sqrt(ln(t - 69)) / [sqrt(ln(t - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - t))]. So when we add the original and the transformed integrand, we get [sqrt(a) / (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))] + [sqrt(b)/(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))] = (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))/(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) = 1. Therefore, the sum of I and I is the integral of 1 over 420 to 1672, which is 1252. Therefore, 2I = 1252, so I = 626. So the exact answer is 626. Therefore, the numerical approximation is 626.0000000000. 

But wait, let me check if the substitution is correct. Let me take a simple case. Suppose x is 420, then t is 1672. Then in the original integrand, when x=420, the term ln(2023 - 420) is ln(2023 - 420) = ln(1603). The transformed integrand at t=1672 would be sqrt(ln(1672 - 69)) / [sqrt(ln(1672 - 69)) + sqrt(ln(2023 - 1672))]. Wait, 1672 - 69 is 1672 - 69 = 1603, and 2023 - 1672 = 351. So sqrt(ln(1603)) / [sqrt(ln(1603)) + sqrt(ln(351))]. Which is the same as the original integrand when x=1672. Wait, but in the original integrand, when x=1672, it's sqrt(ln(2023 - 1672)) / [sqrt(ln(2023 - 1672)) + sqrt(ln(1672 - 69))] = sqrt(ln(351)) / [sqrt(ln(351)) + sqrt(ln(1603))]. So yes, the transformed integrand at t=1672 is the same as the original integrand at x=1672. So the substitution is correct. Therefore, the sum of I and the transformed I is indeed the integral of 1 over the interval, which is 1252. Therefore, 2I = 1252, so I = 626. So the exact answer is 626. The numerical approximation is exactly 626.0000000000. So the answer is 626. So the JSON should be {"answer": "626", "numerical_answer": "626.0000000000"}. But the problem says to put the exact answer in LaTeX, so maybe 626 is just 626, but perhaps boxed. So in LaTeX, it's \boxed{626}. Yeah, that's correct.
