Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1 of e^{arctan(x)} divided by (x² + 1) raised to the 3/2 power. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but maybe substitution will help here. 

First, I remember that when dealing with arctan(x), a common substitution is to let u be arctan(x). Let me try that. So if u = arctan(x), then the derivative du/dx is 1/(x² + 1). That means dx = (x² + 1) du. Wait, but in the integral, we have (x² + 1)^{3/2} in the denominator. Let me write that down step by step.

Let u = arctan(x). Then, du = 1/(x² + 1) dx. So, dx = (x² + 1) du. But in the denominator, we have (x² + 1)^{3/2}, so the denominator becomes (x² + 1)^{3/2} = (x² + 1) * (x² + 1)^{1/2}. Hmm, maybe substituting u will help here. Let's see.

Rewriting the integral in terms of u. The numerator is e^{arctan(x)} which is e^u. The denominator is (x² + 1)^{3/2}. So substituting, we have e^u / (x² + 1)^{3/2} * dx. But dx is (x² + 1) du. So substituting, the integral becomes e^u / (x² + 1)^{3/2} * (x² + 1) du. That simplifies to e^u / (x² + 1)^{1/2} du. But x² + 1 in terms of u? Since u = arctan(x), then x = tan(u). Therefore, x² + 1 = tan²(u) + 1 = sec²(u). So (x² + 1)^{1/2} is sec(u). Therefore, the integral becomes e^u / sec(u) du. Which is e^u * cos(u) du.

So now the integral simplifies to the integral of e^u * cos(u) du. That's a standard integral that can be solved by integration by parts. Let me recall how to integrate e^u cos(u) du. Let's set:

Let’s let’s do integration by parts. Let’s set v = e^u, dw = cos(u) du. Wait, no, maybe another way. Let me set:

Let’s let I = ∫ e^u cos(u) du. Let’s use integration by parts, letting the first part be e^u and the second part be cos(u). So, let’s set:

Let’s take t = e^u, dv = cos(u) du. Then dt = e^u du, and v = sin(u). So integration by parts gives t*v - ∫ v dt = e^u sin(u) - ∫ e^u sin(u) du. Now, the remaining integral is ∫ e^u sin(u) du. Let’s do integration by parts again. Let’s set t = e^u, dv = sin(u) du. Then dt = e^u du, v = -cos(u). So that integral becomes -e^u cos(u) + ∫ e^u cos(u) du. 

Putting it all together: I = e^u sin(u) - [ -e^u cos(u) + ∫ e^u cos(u) du ] = e^u sin(u) + e^u cos(u) - I. So, I to both sides: 2I = e^u (sin(u) + cos(u)) + C. Therefore, I = (e^u (sin(u) + cos(u)))/2 + C. 

So going back to our substitution. The integral from 0 to 1 of e^{arctan(x)}/(x² +1)^{3/2} dx becomes the integral from u=0 (since arctan(0)=0) to u=arctan(1)=π/4 of e^u cos(u) du. Which we found to be [e^u (sin(u) + cos(u))]/2 evaluated from 0 to π/4.

So plugging in the limits: at upper limit π/4: e^{π/4} (sin(π/4) + cos(π/4)) /2. At lower limit 0: e^0 (sin(0) + cos(0))/2 = (0 + 1)/2 = 1/2.

Compute the upper limit: sin(π/4) and cos(π/4) are both √2/2. So sin(π/4) + cos(π/4) = √2/2 + √2/2 = √2. Therefore, upper limit term is e^{π/4} * √2 / 2. So the integral is [e^{π/4} * √2 / 2] - [1/2]. 

Factor out 1/2: (1/2)(e^{π/4} * √2 - 1). Let me check that. Yes, the upper limit is e^{π/4}*(√2)/2, subtract 1/2. So combining terms, (e^{π/4} * √2 - 1)/2. So the exact answer is (e^{π/4} * √2 - 1)/2.

Now, let's compute the numerical approximation. First, compute π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634. Then e^{0.7853981634} ≈ e^0.7854. Let me calculate that. e^0.7 is about 2.0137527, e^0.78 is approximately 2.181472, e^0.7854 is approximately e^{0.7854} ≈ 2.193717. Let me check with a calculator. Alternatively, use a more precise method. Let me use a calculator: 0.7853981634 is π/4. So e^{π/4} ≈ 2.1937171053. Then multiply by √2 ≈ 1.4142135624. So 2.1937171053 * 1.4142135624 ≈ Let's compute that. 2 * 1.4142 is 2.8284, 0.193717 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.193717*1.4142 ≈ 0.274. So total approx 2.8284 + 0.274 ≈ 3.1024. But let's do it more accurately. 2.1937171053 * 1.4142135624. Let's compute 2.1937171053 * 1.4142135624:

First, 2 *1.4142135624 = 2.8284271248

0.1937171053 *1.4142135624 ≈

0.1 *1.4142135624 = 0.14142135624

0.09 *1.4142135624 = 0.1272792206

0.0037171053 *1.4142135624 ≈ approx 0.0037171 *1.4142 ≈ 0.00526

Adding those: 0.14142135624 + 0.1272792206 = 0.2687005768 + 0.00526 ≈ 0.27396

So total is 2.8284271248 + 0.27396 ≈ 3.1023871248. So e^{π/4} * √2 ≈ 3.1023871248. Then subtract 1: 3.1023871248 -1 = 2.1023871248. Then divide by 2: 2.1023871248 /2 ≈ 1.0511935624. So the numerical value is approximately 1.0511935624. Let me check with a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, use a calculator input. Let me compute e^(π/4) first. π ≈ 3.141592653589793. π/4 ≈ 0.7853981633974483. e^0.7853981633974483 ≈ 2.193717105373265. Multiply by √2 ≈ 1.4142135623730951. 2.193717105373265 * 1.4142135623730951 ≈ Let's compute this:

2.193717105373265 * 1.4142135623730951

First, 2 *1.4142135623730951 = 2.8284271247461903

0.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 ≈

0.1 *1.4142135623730951 = 0.1414213562373095

0.09 *1.4142135623730951 = 0.12727922061357856

0.003717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 ≈

0.003 *1.4142135623730951 = 0.0042426406871285

0.000717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 ≈ approx 0.0010145

Adding up: 0.1414213562373095 + 0.12727922061357856 = 0.26870057685088806

0.0042426406871285 + 0.0010145 ≈ 0.0052571406871285

Total: 0.26870057685088806 + 0.0052571406871285 ≈ 0.27395771753801656

Adding to the 2.8284271247461903: 2.8284271247461903 + 0.27395771753801656 ≈ 3.102384842284207

Subtract 1: 3.102384842284207 -1 = 2.102384842284207

Divide by 2: 2.102384842284207 /2 ≈ 1.0511924211421035

So approximately 1.0511924211. Let me check with a calculator precision. Alternatively, use a calculator for e^{π/4}*√2 -1 over 2.

Alternatively, use a calculator to compute the integral numerically. Let me check with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the original integral numerically from 0 to 1 of e^{arctan(x)}/(x² +1)^{3/2} dx.

But according to our analytical result, it's (e^{π/4} * √2 -1)/2 ≈ (2.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 -1)/2 ≈ (3.102384842284207 -1)/2 ≈ 2.102384842284207/2 ≈ 1.0511924211421035. So approximately 1.0511924211. Let me verify this with a numerical integration.

Alternatively, use a calculator. Let me use approximate values:

Compute e^{arctan(x)}/(x² +1)^{3/2} at x=0: e^0}/(0 +1)^{3/2} =1/1=1.

At x=1: e^{π/4}/(2)^{3/2} ≈ 2.1937171 / (2.8284271247461903) ≈ 0.775.

But the integral is between 0 and 1. Let's approximate using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals. But maybe Simpson's rule. Let's take n=4 intervals. h=0.25.

Compute the function at x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.

At x=0: f(0)=1.

x=0.25: arctan(0.25)≈0.2450, e^{0.2450}≈1.2776. (0.25² +1)=1.0625, (1.0625)^{3/2}=sqrt(1.0625)^3=1.03125^3≈1.09544. So f(0.25)=1.2776/1.09544≈1.166.

x=0.5: arctan(0.5)≈0.4636, e^{0.4636}≈1.589. (0.5² +1)=1.25, (1.25)^{3/2}=sqrt(1.25)^3≈1.1180^3≈1.397. So f(0.5)=1.589/1.397≈1.137.

x=0.75: arctan(0.75)≈0.6435, e^{0.6435}≈1.902. (0.75² +1)=1.5625, (1.5625)^{3/2}=sqrt(1.5625)=1.25, so 1.25^3=1.953125. So f(0.75)=1.902/1.953125≈0.974.

x=1: f(1)=e^{π/4}/2^{3/2}≈2.1937/2.8284≈0.775.

Now, using Simpson's rule for n=4 (which requires even number of intervals, so n=4 is okay). Simpson's rule formula: (h/3)[f(x0) + 4(f(x1)+f(x3)) + 2f(x2) + f(x4)]

h=0.25. So:

(0.25/3)[1 + 4*(1.166 +0.974) + 2*1.137 +0.775]

Compute inside:

4*(1.166 +0.974)=4*(2.14)=8.56

2*1.137=2.274

Sum: 1 +8.56 +2.274 +0.775=1+8.56=9.56; 9.56+2.274=11.834; 11.834+0.775=12.609

Multiply by 0.25/3: 0.25/3≈0.0833333. 0.0833333*12.609≈1.0508. So Simpson's rule gives approx 1.0508, which is close to our analytical result of ~1.051192. So that seems to confirm the analytical result is correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is (e^{\pi/4} \sqrt{2} -1)/2, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.0511924211. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that would be 1.0511924211. Let me check with more precise calculation. Let me compute e^{π/4}*√2:

e^{π/4} ≈ 2.193717105373265

√2 ≈1.4142135623730951

Multiply them: 2.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951

Let me compute this precisely:

2.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951

First, 2 *1.4142135623730951 =2.8284271247461903

0.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951

Break down 0.193717105373265:

0.1 *1.4142135623730951 =0.14142135623730951

0.09 *1.4142135623730951 =0.12727922061357856

0.003717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 ≈

0.003 *1.4142135623730951=0.0042426406871285

0.000717105373265 *1.4142135623730951≈0.0010145

So total for 0.193717105373265 *1.4142135623730951 ≈0.14142135623730951 +0.12727922061357856=0.26870057685088807 +0.0042426406871285=0.2729432175380166 +0.0010145≈0.2739577175380166

So total e^{π/4}*√2≈2.8284271247461903 +0.2739577175380166≈3.102384842284207

Subtract 1:3.102384842284207 -1=2.102384842284207

Divide by 2:2.102384842284207 /2=1.0511924211421035

Rounded to 10 decimal places:1.0511924211. So the numerical approximation is 1.0511924211.

Therefore, the exact answer is \boxed{\dfrac{e^{\pi/4} \sqrt{2} - 1}{2}} and the numerical is approximately 1.0511924211.
