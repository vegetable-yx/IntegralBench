Okay, let's see. I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to infinity of (x^3)/(e^x - 1) multiplied by [8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x)] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that cosh(ax) can be expressed in terms of exponentials: cosh(ax) = (e^{ax} + e^{-ax})/2. So maybe expanding the terms inside the brackets will help. Let me try that:

8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x) = 8*(e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x})/2 - (e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x})/2.

Simplifying that, 8 divided by 2 is 4, so it becomes 4(e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x}) - 0.5(e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x}).

So the integral becomes x^3/(e^x - 1) multiplied by [4(e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x}) - 0.5(e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x})] dx.

Hmm, maybe I can split this into separate integrals. Let's distribute the x^3/(e^x -1) term1: 4x^3 (e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x})/(e^x -1)
 term2: -0.5x^3 (e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x})/(e^x -1)

So the integral is 4 times the sum of two integrals minus 0.5 times the sum of two other integrals.

But how do I handle each of these integrals? Let's take one term at a time. Let's consider the general form of x^3 e^{kx}/(e^x -1) dx from 0 to infinity. Maybe I can find a substitution or relate it to known integrals.

Wait, I recall that integrals of the form ∫₀^∞ x^n/(e^x -1) dx = Γ(n+1) ζ(n+1), where Γ is the gamma function and ζ is the Riemann zeta function. But here we have an extra exponential term e^{kx} in the numerator. Hmm, so maybe we can adjust that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write e^{kx}/(e^x -1) as 1/(e^{(1 -k)x} - e^{-kx}}? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Let's factor out e^{-x} from the denominator: e^{kx}/(e^x -1) = e^{(k-1)x}/(1 - e^{-x}). Then, 1/(1 - e^{-x}) is the sum of a geometric series for |e^{-x}| <1, which is true for x>0. So maybe expanding as a series.

So, 1/(1 - e^{-x}) = Σ_{n=0}^∞ e^{-n x} for x >0. Therefore, e^{kx}/(e^x -1) = e^{(k-1)x}/(1 - e^{-x}) = e^{(k-1)x} Σ_{n=0}^∞ e^{-n x} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ e^{(k -1 -n)x}.

Therefore, the term x^3 e^{kx}/(e^x -1) becomes x^3 Σ_{n=0}^∞ e^{(k -1 -n)x} dx. Then, integrating term by term (if allowed), the integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^∞ ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{(k -1 -n)x} dx.

But the integral ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{-a x} dx = 6/a^4, provided that a >0. So here, the exponent is (k -1 -n)x. For convergence, we need (k -1 -n) <0, so n > k -1. But since n starts at 0, this would require k -1 -n <0, which is n > k -1. But if k is a positive number, then depending on k, the exponent's coefficient may be positive or negative. Wait, but in our case, the original integral is from 0 to infinity, so for convergence, the exponent in e^{(k -1 -n)x} must be negative. So (k -1 -n) must be negative. Therefore, n > k -1. But n starts at 0, so for k -1 -n <0, n must be greater than k -1. But if k is, say, 0.5, then k -1 = -0.5, so n > -0.5. Since n is an integer starting at 0, all terms n >=0 will satisfy n > -0.5. So in that case, the exponent is (k -1 -n)x = (-0.5 -n)x, which is negative for all n >=0. So the integral would converge. Similarly, for k=0.25, k-1= -0.75, so again, n >=0 gives exponents (-0.75 -n)x, which is negative. So in that case, the integral can be expressed as the sum over n of 6/( (1 +n -k)^4 ). Wait, let's check:

The integral ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{(k -1 -n)x} dx. Let me set a = -(k -1 -n) = (n +1 -k). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{-a x} dx = 6/a^4. So the integral is 6/( (n +1 -k)^4 ). Therefore, each term in the sum is 6/( (n +1 -k)^4 ), so the original integral for each term is Σ_{n=0}^∞ 6/( (n +1 -k)^4 ). Therefore, the integral ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{k x}/(e^x -1) dx = 6 Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n +1 -k)^4.

Wait, but this seems like a shifted zeta function. The sum Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + c)^4 is the Hurwitz zeta function ζ(4, c). But if c is 1 -k, then it's ζ(4, 1 -k). However, the Riemann zeta function is ζ(s) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s, so ζ(4) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^4. The Hurwitz zeta function is Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + a)^s. So in our case, the sum is ζ(4, 1 -k). But if 1 -k is a positive real number, which it is if k <1, which in our case, k is 0.5 and 0.25, so 1 -k is 0.5 and 0.75, respectively. So, for each term in the original integral, we can express them in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function.

But maybe there's a way to relate this to the Riemann zeta function. Let's see. For example, if we have Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n + a)^s = ζ(s, a). So, for example, when a=1, ζ(s,1) = ζ(s). So, in our case, for the term with k=0.5, the sum is ζ(4, 0.5), and for k=0.25, it's ζ(4, 0.75). Therefore, the integral ∫₀^∞ x^3 e^{k x}/(e^x -1) dx = 6 ζ(4, 1 -k).

Wait, but wait, when we have k=0.5, then 1 -k=0.5, so the sum is ζ(4, 0.5). Similarly, for k=0.25, 1 -k=0.75, so ζ(4, 0.75). Therefore, each of the four terms in the original integral can be expressed in terms of these Hurwitz zeta functions.

But let's check the original expression. The original integrand is [8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x)] multiplied by x^3/(e^x -1). Expanding the cosh terms, we have:

8*(e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x})/2 - (e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x})/2 = 4(e^{0.5x} + e^{-0.5x}) - 0.5(e^{0.25x} + e^{-0.25x}).

Therefore, the integral into four terms:

4* [ integral x^3 e^{0.5x}/(e^x -1) dx + integral x^3 e^{-0.5x}/(e^x -1) dx ] - 0.5*[ integral x^3 e^{0.25x}/(e^x -1) dx + integral x^3 e^{-0.25x}/(e^x -1) dx ]

So each of these four integrals can be expressed as 6 ζ(4, 1 -k) where k is 0.5, -0.5, 0.25, -0.25. Wait, but when k is negative, like e^{-0.5x} is the same as e^{k x} with k=-0.5. So for each term:

For e^{0.5x}/(e^x -1), k=0.5, so 1 = 6 ζ(4, 1 -0.5) = 6 ζ(4, 0.5)

For e^{-0.5x}/(e^x -1), k=-0.5, so 1 -k =1 -(-0.5)=1.5, so integral2=6 ζ(4,1.5)

Similarly, for e^{0.25x}/(e^x -1), k=0.25, integral3=6 ζ(4, 0.75)

For e^{-0.25x}/(e^x -1), k=-0.25, integral4=6 ζ(4,1.25)

Therefore, putting it all together:

The original integral is:

4*(6 ζ(4,0.5) +6 ζ(4,1.5)) -0.5*(6 ζ(4,0.75) +6 ζ(4,1.25))

Simplify:

= 4*6 [ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)] -0.5*6 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)]

=24 [ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)] -3 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)]

Now, I need to compute these Hurwitz zeta functions. But how?

I recall that the Hurwitz zeta function can sometimes be related to the Riemann zeta function. For example, ζ(s, a) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n + a)^s. For a=1, it's the Riemann zeta function. For other a, it's a shifted version.

But perhaps there's a relation or known values for these specific parameters. Let's check:

First, ζ(4,0.5). Let's compute that. ζ(4,0.5) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +0.5)^4. Similarly, ζ(4,1.5) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +1.5)^4.

Similarly for the others. But how can we compute these sums?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation between ζ(s, a) and ζ(s) or other functions. For example, the Riemann zeta function can be expressed in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function: ζ(s) = ζ(s,1).

Another thought: the sum ζ(4,0.5) can be written as Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +0.5)^4. Let's split the sum into even and odd terms. Let me set n = 2k and n=2k+1. Wait, but n starts at 0. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of the Riemann zeta function with a substitution.

Alternatively, recall that ζ(s, a) can be related to the Dirichlet eta function or other special functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the reflection formula or functional equations. But I might not remember the exact relations.

Alternatively, use known values. For example, ζ(4, 0.5) is known. Let me check if there's a closed-form expression for ζ(4, 0.5). Let me recall that ζ(2n, 1/2) can be expressed in terms of the Bernoulli numbers. Wait, there's a formula for ζ(s,1/2):

ζ(s, 1/2) = (2^s -1) ζ(s). Wait, no, ζ(s,1/2) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +1/2)^s = 2^s Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(2n +1)^s = 2^s (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s). Wait, let's see:

Wait, ζ(s,1/2) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +1/2)^s = Σ_{k=1}^\infty 1/(k -1/2)^s where k =n+1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, split the Riemann zeta function into even and odd terms:

ζ(s) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^s = Σ_{n even} 1/n^s + Σ_{n odd} 1/n^s.

For even n=2m: Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(2m)^s = 2^{-s} ζ(s).

For odd n=2m-1: Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(2m-1)^s = (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s).

But ζ(s,1/2) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +1/2)^s = Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(m -1/2)^s = Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/( (2m -1)/2 )^s = 2^s Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(2m -1)^s = 2^s (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s).

Yes, that's correct. So ζ(s,1/2) = 2^s (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s) = (2^s -1) ζ(s).

Wait, let's check:

If ζ(s,1/2) = 2^s Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(2m -1)^s = 2^s (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s). Because Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(2m -1)^s = (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s). Therefore, ζ(s,1/2) = 2^s (1 - 2^{-s}) ζ(s) = (2^s -1) ζ(s).

Yes, that's right. So for s=4, ζ(4,1/2) = (2^4 -1) ζ(4) = 15 ζ(4).

Similarly, ζ(4,1.5) = ζ(4, 3/2). How can we compute that? Let's see. ζ(4,3/2) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/2)^4. Let's write n = m +1, so m starts at 0: Σ_{m=0}^\infty 1/(m +1 +1/2)^4 = Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(m +1/2)^4 = ζ(4,1/2) - 1/(1/2)^4. Wait, no. Wait, ζ(4,3/2) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/2)^4 = Σ_{m=3/2}^\infty 1/m^4. Which is ζ(4) - Σ_{m=1}^{1/2} 1/m^4. But m=1, but 3/2 is 1.5, so ζ(4,3/2) = Σ_{m=3/2,5/2,...} 1/m^4. Alternatively, writing m =k +1/2, k=1: Σ_{k=1}^\infty 1/(k +1/2)^4 = ζ(4,1/2) - 1/(1/2)^4. Wait, ζ(4,1/2) = Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(k +1/2)^4. So ζ(4,3/2) = Σ_{k=1}^\infty 1/(k +1/2)^4 = ζ(4,1/2) - 1/(1/2)^4.

But 1/(1/2)^4 = 16. So ζ(4,3/2) = ζ(4,1/2) -16 = 15 ζ(4) -16.

But we need to compute ζ(4). I know that ζ(4) = π^4/90. So ζ(4) = π^4/90 ≈ 1.082323... So ζ(4,1/2) =15 * π^4/90 = (15/90) π^4 = π^4/6 ≈ 16.082323...

Then ζ(4,3/2) = π^4/6 -16 ≈ 16.082323 -16 =0.082323... But wait, let's compute it properly.

Wait, ζ(4,1/2) =15 ζ(4) =15*(π^4/90)= π^4/6. Then ζ(4,3/2) = ζ(4,1/2) -1/(1/2)^4 = π^4/6 -16. So that's correct.

Similarly, for ζ(4,0.75) and ζ(4,1.25). Let's handle those. 0.75 is 3/4, and 1.25 is 5/4.

Hmm, ζ(4,3/4) and ζ(4,5/4). These might not have such straightforward expressions. Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps use the relation between the Hurwitz zeta function and the polylogarithm function. The polylogarithm Li_s(z) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty z^n /n^s. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, use the integral representation of the Hurwitz zeta function. But that might not be helpful for exact evaluation.

Alternatively, use the relation with the Riemann zeta function for rational arguments. There's a formula for ζ(s, a) when a is a rational number. For example, when a = p/q, there's a formula involving sums of the Riemann zeta function and trigonometric functions. But I'm not remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, use the reflection formula or functional equation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use known values. For example, ζ(4,3/4) and ζ(4,5/4). Let me check if there's a known expression for these.

Alternatively, consider that ζ(s, a) can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet beta function for certain a. For example, when a is 1/4 or 3/4, there might be a relation involving the Dirichlet beta function, which is related to sums over alternating series.

Alternatively, use the identity that for a = p/q, ζ(s, a) can be expressed as a finite combination of the Riemann zeta function and trigonometric functions. For example, from the multiplication theorem.

Alternatively, use the identity:

ζ(s, m + a) = ζ(s, a) - Σ_{k=0}^{m-1} 1/(k +a)^s.

But in our case, for ζ(4,5/4), which is ζ(4,1 +1/4) = ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4.

But ζ(4,1/4) is another value we need. Similarly, ζ(4,3/4) is another term.

Alternatively, perhaps use the relation between the Hurwitz zeta function and the polygamma function. The Hurwitz zeta function is related to the polygamma function of order m via ζ(m, a) = (-1)^{m} ψ^{(m-1)}(a) / (m-1)! ). But for m=4, ζ(4, a) = ψ'''(a)/6. But integrating this might not help unless we can compute the third derivative of the digamma function at a=3/4, 5/4, etc. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, use the integral representation of the Hurwitz zeta function:

ζ(s, a) = 1/Γ(s) ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} e^{-a t}/(1 - e^{-t}) dt.

But integrating this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, use the Fourier series expansion or other series expansions. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, look for known values. For example, ζ(4,1/4) and ζ(4,3/4). Let me check if these are known.

Upon some research, I recall that for rational arguments, the Hurwitz zeta function can sometimes be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and trigonometric functions. For example, using the identity:

ζ(s, a) + ζ(s,1 -a) = (2π)^s}/(Γ(s)) ) ∫₀^∞ cos(2πa t) t^{s-1}/(e^{2π t} -1) dt.

But this might not help here.

Alternatively, use the reflection formula for the Hurwitz zeta function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the relation between the Dirichlet beta function and the Hurwitz zeta function. The Dirichlet beta function is β(s) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n / (2n +1)^s ). But I don't see a direct connection here.

Alternatively, consider that ζ(4,3/4) can be expressed as Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/4)^4. Let's write n =4k +m, where m=0,1,2,3. Then split the sum into residues modulo 4. But this might not lead to a simplification.

Alternatively, use the fact that ζ(s, a) can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the polylogarithm function. For example, ζ(s, a) = 1/Γ(s) ∫₀^∞ t^{s-1} e^{-a t}/(1 - e^{-t}) dt. But integrating this might not help.

Alternatively, use numerical computation. Since the problem also requires a numerical approximation, perhaps we can compute these Hurwitz zeta functions numerically.

But the problem says to compute the integral analytically first. So maybe there's a way to combine these terms to get a closed-form expression.

Wait, let's recall that the original integral is expressed in terms of the four Hurwitz zeta functions. Let's write the entire integral expression again:

24 [ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)] -3 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)]

We already have expressions for ζ(4,0.5) and ζ(4,1.5):

ζ(4,0.5) =15 ζ(4) =15*(π^4/90)= π^4/6

ζ(4,1.5) = ζ(4,0.5) -1/(0.5)^4 = π^4/6 -16

So ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5) = π^4/6 + (π^4/6 -16) = π^4/3 -16

Then the first part is 24*(π^4/3 -16) =24*(π^4/3) -24*16=8 π^4 -384

Now, the second part is -3 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)]

We need to compute ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25). Let's denote a=0.75=3/4 and b=1.25=5/4.

Note that ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/4)^4 + Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +5/4)^4.

But notice that ζ(4,5/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +5/4)^4 = Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(m +1/4)^4 where m =n+1. So ζ(4,5/4) = ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4.

But ζ(4,1/4) is another term. Similarly, ζ(4,3/4) is another term.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation between ζ(4,3/4) and ζ(4,1/4). Let's see:

ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/4)^4 + Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +1/4)^4.

But this is the same as Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(k +1/4)^4 +1/(k +3/4)^4] where k =n for each sum.

This resembles the sum over odd denominators. Let's see:

If we consider k=0: 1/(1/4)^4 +1/(3/4)^4 =4^4 + (4/3)^4=256 + 256/81=256*(1 +1/81)=256*(82/81)=256*82/81.

But this is just the first term. The entire sum would be Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(k +1/4)^4 +1/(k +3/4)^4].

But how does this relate to other zeta functions? Maybe express this in terms of the Riemann zeta function with some transformation.

Alternatively, use the reflection formula for the Hurwitz zeta function. There's a formula that relates ζ(s, a) and ζ(s,1 -a) in terms of the gamma function and trigonometric functions. The reflection formula is:

ζ(1 -s, a) = (2 Γ(s))/(2π)^s) [cos(πs/2) Σ_{n=1}^\infty sin(2πn a)/n^{1 -s} + sin(πs/2) Σ_{n=1}^\infty cos(2πn a)/n^{1 -s} ]

But this seems complicated and might not help for s=4.

Alternatively, use the functional equation of the Hurwitz zeta function, but I'm not familiar enough with it.

Alternatively, consider that ζ(s, a) can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function when a is rational. For example, for a = p/q, there's a formula involving sums over roots of unity. Specifically, the formula is:

ζ(s, p/q) = (2 Γ(1 -s))/( (2π q)^{1 -s} )) Σ_{k=1}^q sin(πs/2 + 2πk p/q) ζ(1 -s, k/q)

But this might not be helpful here.

Alternatively, use the identity that for a rational number a = p/q, the Hurwitz zeta function ζ(s, a) can be expressed as a finite sum involving the Riemann zeta function and trigonometric functions. For example, from the paper "Values of the Riemann zeta function at rational numbers" or similar resources. But I don't have access to that, so I need to think differently.

Alternatively, use the fact that ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function and the Dirichlet beta function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1.25) = ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4). Let's see:

ζ(4,5/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +5/4)^4 = Σ_{m=1}^\infty 1/(m +1/4)^4 = ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4.

Similarly, ζ(4,3/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty 1/(n +3/4)^4.

So ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4.

But ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty [1/(n +1/4)^4 +1/(n +3/4)^4].

This sum can be related to ζ(4) but with some scaling. Let's consider that:

Σ_{n=0}^\infty [1/(4n +1)^4 +1/(4n +3)^4] = (1/4^4) Σ_{n=0}^\infty [1/(n +1/4)^4 +1/(n +3/4)^4] = (1/256) [ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4)].

But the left-hand side is the sum over odd denominators congruent to 1 and 3 mod 4. This is related to the Dirichlet beta function for s=4. The Dirichlet beta function is β(s) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n / (2n +1)^s. But here, we have a sum of 1/(4n +1)^4 +1/(4n +3)^4, which is similar to β(4) but without the alternating signs. Let's denote this sum as S = Σ_{n=0}^\infty [1/(4n +1)^4 +1/(4n +3)^4].

Then, S = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(4k +1)^4 +1/(4k +3)^4].

But how to express S in terms of known functions? Let's note that:

The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^s.

The Dirichlet eta function η(s) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^s.

The Dirichlet beta function β(s) = Σ_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n/(2n +1)^s.

But our sum S is Σ_{n=0}^\infty [1/(4n +1)^4 +1/(4n +3)^4] = Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(4k +1)^4 + Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(4k +3)^4.

This can be written as (1/4^4) [ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4)].

But I don't know a closed-form expression for this sum. However, perhaps there's a relation between this sum and the Riemann zeta function. Let's consider that:

ζ(4) = Σ_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^4 = Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(4k +1)^4 +1/(4k +2)^4 +1/(4k +3)^4 +1/(4k +4)^4].

So, ζ(4) = S + Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(4k +2)^4 +1/(4k +4)^4].

The second sum is Σ_{k=0}^\infty [1/(4k +2)^4 +1/(4k +4)^4] = Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(2(2k +1))^4 + Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(4(k +1))^4 = (1/16) Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(k +0.5)^4 + (1/256) Σ_{k=1}^\infty 1/k^4.

But Σ_{k=0}^\infty 1/(k +0.5)^4 = ζ(4,0.5) = π^4/6.

Σ_{k=1}^\infty 1/k^4 = ζ(4) = π^4/90.

Therefore, the second sum is (1/16)(π^4/6) + (1/256)(π^4/90) = π^4/(96) + π^4/(23040).

Therefore, ζ(4) = S + π^4/96 + π^4/23040.

Solving for S:

S = ζ(4) - π^4/96 - π^4/23040.

But ζ(4) = π^4/90, so:

S = π^4/90 - π^4/96 - π^4/23040.

Let's compute this:

First, find a common denominator. Let's use 23040.

π^4/90 = π^4 * 256/23040

π^4/96 = π^4 * 240/23040

π^4/23040 = π^4 *1/23040

So S = π^4 (256 -240 -1)/23040 = π^4 (15)/23040 = π^4 /1536.

Therefore, S = π^4 /1536.

But S = (1/256)(ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4)) = π^4 /1536.

Therefore, ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4) =256 * π^4 /1536 = π^4 /6.

So ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4) = π^4 /6.

But we have ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4 = π^4/6 - 256.

Therefore, ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = π^4/6 -256.

Therefore, going back to the original expression:

The second part is -3 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)] = -3 [π^4/6 -256] = -3*(π^4/6) + 768 = -π^4/2 +768.

Therefore, combining both parts:

The integral =8 π^4 -384 -π^4/2 +768 = (8 π^4 -π^4/2) + (-384 +768) = (15/2 π^4) +384.

So the exact answer is 15/2 π^4 +384.

Wait, let's check the calculation again:

First part: 24*(π^4/3 -16) =8 π^4 -384.

Second part: -3*(π^4/6 -256) = -π^4/2 +768.

Adding them together: 8 π^4 -384 -π^4/2 +768 = (8 -0.5) π^4 + ( -384 +768 )=7.5 π^4 +384.

7.5 is 15/2, so 15/2 π^4 +384.

But wait, 15/2 π^4 +384. Is that correct? Let me verify the steps again:

Original integral:

24 [ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)] -3 [ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)]

We found:

ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5) = π^4/3 -16

So 24*(π^4/3 -16) =24*(π^4/3) -24*16=8 π^4 -384.

Then, ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25) = π^4/6 -256

So -3*(π^4/6 -256) = -π^4/2 +768.

Adding the two parts:

8 π^4 -384 -π^4/2 +768 = (8 π^4 -0.5 π^4) + ( -384 +768 )=7.5 π^4 +384.

Yes, 7.5 is 15/2. So the exact answer is (15/2) π^4 +384.

But wait, this seems a bit odd. Let me check the numerical value. Let's compute 15/2 π^4 +384.

First, π^4 ≈97.409091034.

So 15/2 *97.409091034 ≈7.5 *97.409091034≈730.568182755.

Adding 384: 730.568182755 +384≈1114.568182755.

But let's check if this makes sense. The original integral is a sum of positive terms? Let's see. The integrand is x^3/(e^x -1) multiplied by [8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x)].

For x>0, cosh(0.5x) and cosh(0.25x) are both positive. 8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x). Let's check at x=0: cosh(0)=1, so 8*1 -1=7>0. As x increases, cosh(0.5x) grows faster than cosh(0.25x), so the coefficient remains positive. Therefore, the integrand is positive for all x>0, so the integral should be positive. The numerical value we got is approximately 1114.57, which is positive. But let's check if this makes sense.

Alternatively, let's compute the numerical approximation step by step.

First, compute the exact expression: (15/2) π^4 +384.

Compute 15/2=7.5. π^4≈97.409091034. So 7.5*97.409091034≈7*97.409091034=681.863637238 +0.5*97.409091034≈48.704545517=730.568182755. Then add 384: 730.568182755+384=1114.568182755. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's approximately 1114.568182755.

But let's check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analytical calculation.

Wait, let's re-express the integral:

The original integral is:

4*(6 ζ(4,0.5) +6 ζ(4,1.5)) -0.5*6*(ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25))

=24*(ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)) -3*(ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25))

We found:

ζ(4,0.5) = π^4/6

ζ(4,1.5) = π^4/6 -16

So ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5) = π^4/6 + π^4/6 -16 = π^4/3 -16

Then, 24*(π^4/3 -16) =8 π^4 -384.

Then, ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25) = π^4/6 -256

So -3*(π^4/6 -256) = -π^4/2 +768

Adding together:8 π^4 -384 -π^4/2 +768 = (8 -0.5) π^4 + (768 -384)=7.5 π^4 +384.

Yes, that's correct. So the exact answer is 7.5 π^4 +384, which is 15/2 π^4 +384.

But wait, 7.5 π^4 +384. Let's check the numerical value again. π^4≈97.409091034.

7.5*97.409091034≈730.568182755. 730.568182755 +384=1114.568182755. So approximately 1114.5681828.

But let's verify this with a numerical approximation of the integral.

Alternatively, compute the integral numerically. Let's approximate the integral ∫₀^∞ x^3/(e^x -1)[8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x)] dx.

But since this is time-consuming, and I'm supposed to provide the numerical approximation, perhaps we can use the analytical result.

But to confirm, let's compute the numerical value of 15/2 π^4 +384.

15/2=7.5. π^4=97.40909103400244 (using a calculator).

7.5 *97.40909103400244=730.5681827550183

730.5681827550183 +384=1114.5681827550183.

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1114.5681827550.

But let's check if this makes sense. Let's compute the integral numerically using another method.

Alternatively, use substitution. Let me consider the integral:

I = ∫₀^∞ x^3/(e^x -1)[8 cosh(0.5x) - cosh(0.25x)] dx.

We can write cosh(ax) = (e^{ax} + e^{-ax})/2. So expanding:

8 cosh(0.5x) =4 e^{0.5x} +4 e^{-0.5x}

-cosh(0.25x) = -0.5 e^{0.25x} -0.5 e^{-0.25x}

So the integrand becomes:

x^3/(e^x -1) [4 e^{0.5x} +4 e^{-0.5x} -0.5 e^{0.25x} -0.5 e^{-0.25x}]

=4 x^3 e^{0.5x}/(e^x -1) +4 x^3 e^{-0.5x}/(e^x -1) -0.5 x^3 e^{0.25x}/(e^x -1) -0.5 x^3 e^{-0.25x}/(e^x -1)

Each of these terms can be expressed as x^3 e^{k x}/(e^x -1), where k is 0.5, -0.5, 0.25, -0.25.

As we did before, each integral is 6 ζ(4,1 -k). So for k=0.5: 6 ζ(4,0.5)

k=-0.5:6 ζ(4,1.5)

k=0.25:6 ζ(4,0.75)

k=-0.25:6 ζ(4,1.25)

So the integral is:

4*6 ζ(4,0.5) +4*6 ζ(4,1.5) -0.5*6 ζ(4,0.75) -0.5*6 ζ(4,1.25)

=24 ζ(4,0.5) +24 ζ(4,1.5) -3 ζ(4,0.75) -3 ζ(4,1.25)

Which is the same as before. So the exact answer is 24*(ζ(4,0.5) + ζ(4,1.5)) -3*(ζ(4,0.75) + ζ(4,1.25)) =15/2 π^4 +384.

Therefore, the exact answer is 384 + (15/2) π^4.

Expressed in LaTeX, that's 384 + \frac{15}{2} \pi^4.

But let's check if this can be simplified further. 15/2 π^4 is 7.5 π^4, but perhaps it's better to leave it as a fraction.

Alternatively, factor out π^4:

384 + (15/2) π^4 = \frac{15}{2} \pi^4 + 384.

Yes, that's the simplest form.

Now, the numerical approximation is approximately 1114.5681827550, which rounds to 1114.5681827550. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it's 1114.5681827550.

But let's verify this with a numerical integration. However, since I can't perform numerical integration here, I'll rely on the analytical result.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Exact: 384 + (15/2) π^4

Numerical: approximately 1114.5681827550.

But let's check if the exact answer can be written in a more elegant form. For example, 384 is 6*64, and 15/2 π^4 is 7.5 π^4. But I don't see a more simplified form. So the exact answer is 384 + (15/2)π^4.

Therefore, the JSON output should be:

{"answer": "384 + \\frac{15}{2} \\pi^4", "numerical_answer": "1114.5681827550"}

But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again. When we computed ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = π^4/6 -256. But how did we get that?

Earlier, we had:

ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,1/4) -1/(1/4)^4.

But we found that ζ(4,1/4) + ζ(4,3/4) = π^4/6.

Therefore, ζ(4,3/4) + ζ(4,5/4) = π^4/6 -1/(1/4)^4 = π^4/6 -256.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the exact answer is indeed 15/2 π^4 +384, and the numerical value is approximately 1114.5681827550.
