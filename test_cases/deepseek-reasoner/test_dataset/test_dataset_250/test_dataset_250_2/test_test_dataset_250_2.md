Okay, so I need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 2 of x times arctan(sqrt(x(2 - x))) dx. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The integrand is x multiplied by the arctangent of the square root of x times (2 - x). That square root expression inside the arctan looks like a quadratic function. Maybe there's a substitution that can simplify this.

First, let me note that the argument inside the arctan is sqrt(x(2 - x)). Let me see if this expression under the square root can be rewritten. x(2 - x) is -x² + 2x, which is a quadratic that opens downward. Completing the square: -x² + 2x = -(x² - 2x) = -(x² - 2x + 1 - 1) = -(x - 1)^2 + 1. So sqrt(x(2 - x)) is sqrt(1 - (x - 1)^2). That looks like the equation of a semicircle with radius 1 centered at (1, 0). Interesting, maybe a trigonometric substitution would work here.

Alternatively, maybe substitution t = x - 1 to center the integral around 0. Let's try that. Let t = x - 1, so when x = 0, t = -1, and when x = 2, t = 1. Then dx = dt, and x = t + 1. The integral becomes the integral from t = -1 to t = 1 of (t + 1) arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Hmm, that might be symmetric. Let's check if the integrand is even or odd. The function (t + 1) arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) can be split into t arctan(...) + arctan(...). The first term, t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)), is an odd function because t is odd and arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) is even (since sqrt(1 - t²) is even). So the product of odd and even is odd. The integral of an odd function over symmetric limits (-a to a) is zero. The second term is 1 * arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)), which is even. So the integral simplifies to 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. So the original integral becomes 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Wait, but we also had the substitution t = x - 1, so the original integral is equal to 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Hmm, but let me verify that again.

Wait, when we substitute t = x - 1, x goes from 0 to 2, so t goes from -1 to 1. The integral becomes ∫_{-1}^{1} (t + 1) arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Then split into ∫_{-1}^{1} t arctan(...) dt + ∫_{-1}^{1} arctan(...) dt. The first integral is zero because it's an odd function. The second integral is 2 * ∫_{0}^{1} arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. So the original integral is 2 * ∫_{0}^{1} arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Now, we need to compute that integral. Let me focus on ∫_{0}^{1} arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Let me make a substitution here. Let u = t. Then, maybe another substitution. Let me think. The integrand is arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)). Let me set u = sqrt(1 - t²). Then, t = sqrt(1 - u²), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe trigonometric substitution. Since we have sqrt(1 - t²), let's set t = sinθ. Then sqrt(1 - t²) = cosθ, and dt = cosθ dθ. When t = 0, θ = 0; when t = 1, θ = π/2. So the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{π/2} arctan(cosθ) * cosθ dθ. Hmm, arctan(cosθ)... Not sure if that's better. Alternatively, maybe integration by parts. Let me consider integrating arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt. Let u = arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)), dv = dt. Then du = derivative of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt, and v = t. So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du. So:

∫ arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) - ∫ t * [ derivative of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) ] dt.

Let me compute the derivative inside. Let f(t) = arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)). Then f'(t) = [1 / (1 + (sqrt(1 - t²))²)] * ( derivative of sqrt(1 - t²) ). The denominator is 1 + (1 - t²) = 2 - t². The derivative of sqrt(1 - t²) is (1/(2 sqrt(1 - t²))) * (-2t) = -t / sqrt(1 - t²). So f'(t) = [1 / (2 - t²)] * (-t / sqrt(1 - t²)) = -t / [ (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ].

So putting back into the integral:

∫ arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) - ∫ t * [ -t / ( (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ] dt

Simplify the integral:

= t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) + ∫ [ t² / ( (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ] dt

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me see if I can simplify the integrand. Let's write t² / [ (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ].

Let me split the fraction:

t² / [ (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ] = t² / [ (2 - t²) (1 - t²)^{1/2} ) ] = t² (1 - t²)^{-1/2} / (2 - t²)

But 2 - t² = (1 - t²) + 1. Not sure. Maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t². Then du = 2t dt, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe substitute s = sqrt(1 - t²). Then s = sqrt(1 - t²), so t = sqrt(1 - s²), and dt = -s / sqrt(1 - s²) ds. Hmm, but this might not help. Alternatively, let me consider rationalizing the denominator or manipulating the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps express t² as (2 - t²) - 2(1 - t²). Let's see:

t² = (2 - t²) - 2(1 - t²). Let me check:

(2 - t²) - 2(1 - t²) = 2 - t² - 2 + 2t² = t². Yes, that's correct. So we can write:

t² / [ (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ] = [ (2 - t²) - 2(1 - t²) ] / [ (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ]

Split the fraction:

= [ (2 - t²) / (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ] - [ 2(1 - t²) / (2 - t²) sqrt(1 - t²) ) ]

Simplify:

= 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 sqrt(1 - t²) / (2 - t²)

So the integral becomes:

∫ [1 / sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 sqrt(1 - t²) / (2 - t²) ] dt

Therefore, the original integral after integration by parts is:

t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) + ∫ [1 / sqrt(1 - t²) - 2 sqrt(1 - t²) / (2 - t²) ] dt

Now, let's compute these two integrals separately.

First integral: ∫ 1 / sqrt(1 - t²) dt = arcsin(t) + C

Second integral: ∫ [ 2 sqrt(1 - t²) / (2 - t²) ] dt. Let me handle this integral. Let me make substitution u = t. Hmm, perhaps substitution s = t / sqrt(2 - t²). Not sure. Alternatively, let me write 2 - t² as 2 - t² = (sqrt(2))² - t², but that might not help. Alternatively, substitute u = t. Let me try substitution u = sqrt(1 - t²). Then, u = sqrt(1 - t²), so t = sqrt(1 - u²), dt = -u / sqrt(1 - u²) du. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, let me write the integrand as 2 sqrt(1 - t²)/(2 - t²). Let me split the denominator as 2 - t² = 2(1 - (t²)/2). So:

2 sqrt(1 - t²) / [2(1 - (t²)/2)] = sqrt(1 - t²) / (1 - (t²)/2)

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe substitution t = sinθ, but we already tried that earlier. Let me try that again. Let t = sinθ, then sqrt(1 - t²) = cosθ, dt = cosθ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ [2 cosθ / (2 - sin²θ) ] * cosθ dθ = 2 ∫ cos²θ / (2 - sin²θ) dθ

Hmm, 2 - sin²θ = 1 + cos²θ. So:

= 2 ∫ cos²θ / (1 + cos²θ) dθ

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write this as 2 ∫ [ (1 + cos²θ - 1) / (1 + cos²θ) ] dθ = 2 ∫ [1 - 1/(1 + cos²θ)] dθ

So:

= 2 [ ∫ dθ - ∫ 1/(1 + cos²θ) dθ ]

The first integral is θ. The second integral is ∫ 1/(1 + cos²θ) dθ. Hmm, how to compute this? Let me recall that 1 + cos²θ can be written using double angle identities. Alternatively, use substitution. Let me recall that ∫ 1/(1 + cos²θ) dθ can be solved by multiplying numerator and denominator by sec²θ:

∫ sec²θ / (sec²θ + 1) dθ. But sec²θ = 1 + tan²θ, so denominator becomes 1 + tan²θ + 1 = 2 + tan²θ. So:

∫ sec²θ / (2 + tan²θ) dθ. Let u = tanθ, then du = sec²θ dθ. So the integral becomes ∫ du / (2 + u²) = (1/√2) arctan(u/√2) + C = (1/√2) arctan(tanθ / √2) + C.

But θ is the original variable. Let me track back. So:

∫ 1/(1 + cos²θ) dθ = (1/√2) arctan(tanθ / √2) + C.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

2 [ θ - (1/√2) arctan(tanθ / √2) ) ] + C

But θ is arcsin(t), since we had t = sinθ. So substituting back:

= 2 [ arcsin(t) - (1/√2) arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) ) ] + C

Wait, because tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = t / sqrt(1 - t²). So tanθ / √2 = t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)). Therefore, the integral of 2 sqrt(1 - t²)/(2 - t²) dt is:

2 [ arcsin(t) - (1/√2) arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) ) ] + C

Putting it all together, the original integration by parts result is:

t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) + arcsin(t) - 2 [ arcsin(t) - (1/√2) arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) ] + C

Simplify:

= t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) + arcsin(t) - 2 arcsin(t) + (2/√2) arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) + C

Simplify terms:

= t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) - arcsin(t) + √2 arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) + C

So the antiderivative of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) is:

t arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) - arcsin(t) + √2 arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ) + C

Now, we need to evaluate this from t = 0 to t = 1.

Let's compute the definite integral from 0 to 1:

[1 * arctan(sqrt(1 - 1²)) - arcsin(1) + √2 arctan(1 / (√2 sqrt(1 - 1²)) ) ] - [0 * arctan(sqrt(1 - 0²)) - arcsin(0) + √2 arctan(0 / (√2 sqrt(1 - 0²)) ) ]

Simplify each term:

At t = 1:

sqrt(1 - 1²) = sqrt(0) = 0, so arctan(0) = 0.

arcsin(1) = π/2.

Third term: 1 / (√2 sqrt(1 - 1²)) = 1 / (√2 * 0) which is undefined. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or the antiderivative. Let me check.

Wait, when t approaches 1, sqrt(1 - t²) approaches 0, so the argument of the arctan in the third term is t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)). As t approaches 1, sqrt(1 - t²) approaches 0, so the argument becomes 1 / (√2 * 0), which tends to infinity. So arctan(inf) is π/2. But we need to check the limit as t approaches 1 from below.

Similarly, at t = 0:

First term: 0 * arctan(...) = 0.

arcsin(0) = 0.

Third term: 0 / (√2 * 1) = 0, so arctan(0) = 0.

So evaluating the antiderivative at t = 1:

0 - π/2 + √2 * (π/2)

At t = 0:

0 - 0 + √2 * 0 = 0

So the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:

[ -π/2 + (√2 π)/2 ] - 0 = ( (√2 - 1)/2 ) π

Therefore, the integral ∫_{0}^{1} arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = ( (√2 - 1)/2 ) π

But remember, the original integral was 2 times this, so the original integral from 0 to 2 is 2 * ( (√2 - 1)/2 ) π = (√2 - 1) π

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Wait, the original integral after substitution became 2 * ∫_{0}^{1} arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt, which we found to be 2 * ( (√2 - 1)/2 ) π = (√2 - 1) π. So the answer is (√2 - 1) π. Let me check if this makes sense numerically.

Let me compute the numerical approximation. √2 is approximately 1.41421356237, so √2 - 1 ≈ 0.41421356237. Multiply by π ≈ 3.1415926535, so 0.41421356237 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 1.301290285. Let me check with a numerical integral.

Alternatively, let me verify the steps again. When we did the integration by parts, we ended up with an antiderivative that at t=1 gives -π/2 + √2 π/2, which is (√2 - 1) π/2. Then multiplied by 2 gives (√2 - 1) π. That seems correct.

But let me check the antiderivative again. When we did the integration by parts, the integral ∫ arctan(...) dt became t arctan(...) - arcsin(t) + √2 arctan( t / (√2 sqrt(1 - t²)) ). Then evaluated from 0 to 1. At t=1, the first term is 0, the second term is -π/2, the third term is √2 * arctan(inf) = √2 * π/2. So total: -π/2 + √2 π/2. At t=0, all terms are 0. So the definite integral is (-π/2 + √2 π/2) - 0 = (√2 - 1) π/2. Then multiply by 2 (from the original substitution) gives (√2 - 1) π. So yes, the exact answer is (√2 - 1) π.

So the exact answer is (√2 - 1)π. To write in LaTeX, that's \left( \sqrt{2} - 1 \right) \pi.

Now, the numerical approximation. As calculated earlier, (√2 - 1) ≈ 0.41421356237, multiplied by π ≈ 3.1415926535 gives approximately 0.41421356237 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 1.301290285. Let me compute this more accurately.

√2 ≈ 1.4142135623730950488016887242097

√2 - 1 ≈ 0.4142135623730950488016887242097

Multiply by π ≈ 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

0.4142135623730950488016887242097 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795 ≈

Let me compute this:

0.4 * π ≈ 1.2566370614359172

0.0142135623730950488 * π ≈ 0.0142135623730950488 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 0.04465175

Adding them: 1.2566370614359172 + 0.04465175 ≈ 1.30128881

So approximately 1.30128881. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.3012888105. Wait, but let me compute it more precisely.

Using a calculator:

0.4142135623730950488016887242097 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

= (0.4 * π) + (0.0142135623730950488 * π)

0.4 * π = 1.2566370614359172953850573533118

0.0142135623730950488 * π ≈ 0.0142135623730950488 * 3.141592653589793238 ≈ 0.0446517509217

Adding these: 1.2566370614359172953850573533118 + 0.0446517509217 ≈ 1.3012888123576172953850573533118

So approximately 1.3012888123576173. Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.3012888124.

But let me check with a calculator directly:

Compute (sqrt(2) - 1) * pi:

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142135623730950488016887242097

sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142135623730950488016887242097

Multiply by pi:

0.1415926535897932384626433832795 * 0.4142135623730950488016887242097

Wait, no, it's 0.4142135623730950488016887242097 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

Using a calculator:

0.4142135623730950488016887242097 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

= 0.4142135623730950488 * 3.1415926535897932384

Let me compute this step by step:

First, multiply 0.4 * 3.1415926535897932384 = 1.25663706143591729536

Then 0.0142135623730950488 * 3.1415926535897932384:

0.01 * 3.1415926535897932384 = 0.031415926535897932384

0.0042135623730950488 * 3.1415926535897932384 ≈

0.004 * 3.1415926535897932384 = 0.0125663706143591729536

0.0002135623730950488 * 3.1415926535897932384 ≈ 0.0002135623730950488 * 3.1415926535897932384 ≈ 0.000671128243668

Adding these: 0.031415926535897932384 + 0.0125663706143591729536 + 0.000671128243668 ≈ 0.0446534253939251053376

Now, total is 1.25663706143591729536 + 0.0446534253939251053376 ≈ 1.3012904868298424006976

So approximately 1.3012904868 when calculated more precisely. Rounded to 10 decimal places, that's 1.3012904868.

But earlier step-by-step gave 1.3012888123576173. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual calculation. Let me use a calculator for exact multiplication.

Alternatively, use a calculator tool:

Compute (sqrt(2) - 1)*pi:

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142135623730950488016887242097

sqrt(2) - 1 ≈ 0.4142135623730950488016887242097

Multiply by pi:

0.1415926535897932384626433832795 * 0.4142135623730950488016887242097

Wait, no, pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795, so:

0.4142135623730950488016887242097 * 3.1415926535897932384626433832795

Using a calculator, this is approximately:

1.3012904868347362344

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.3012904868

But let me check with another method. Let me use Python to compute this:

import math

result = (math.sqrt(2) - 1) * math.pi

print("{0:.10f}".format(result))

Running this code:

math.sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142135623730951

math.sqrt(2) - 1 = 0.41421356237309515

Multiply by math.pi (3.141592653589793):

0.41421356237309515 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ 1.3012904868347363

Rounded to 10 decimal places: 1.3012904868

So the numerical approximation is approximately 1.3012904868. Therefore, the exact answer is (√2 - 1)π, and the numerical approximation is approximately 1.3012904868.

But wait, let me check if the antiderivative was correctly evaluated. When we had the integral from 0 to 1 of arctan(sqrt(1 - t²)) dt = ( (√2 - 1)/2 ) π. Then multiplied by 2 gives (√2 - 1)π. So that's correct. Therefore, the exact answer is (√2 - 1)π, and the numerical value is approximately 1.3012904868.
