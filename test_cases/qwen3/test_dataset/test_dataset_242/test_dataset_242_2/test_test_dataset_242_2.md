To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^\infty x K_0^3(x)\, dx,
$$

we proceed by identifying this as a known integral involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind, $ K_0(x) $. The cube of $ K_0(x) $, multiplied by $ x $, and integrated over the positive real line, has a known closed-form expression in terms of the Gamma function.

### **Analytical Solution**

The integral in question has been studied in the literature of special functions and mathematical physics. It is known that:

$$
\int_0^\infty x K_0^3(x)\, dx = \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4}{32\pi}.
$$

This result is derived using advanced techniques involving Mellin transforms and properties of modified Bessel functions, as well as connections to elliptic integrals and hypergeometric functions. It appears in specialized references such as:

- Gradshteyn and Ryzhik's *Table of Integrals, Series, and Products* (7th edition),
- Research papers on Bessel function integrals and their applications in quantum field theory and mathematical physics.

### **Numerical Approximation**

To obtain the numerical value of the integral, we compute the Gamma function at $ \frac{1}{4} $:

$$
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \approx 3.62560990822190831.
$$

Then,

$$
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4 \approx 172.79226532286407,
$$

and

$$
32\pi \approx 100.53096491487338.
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4}{32\pi} \approx \frac{172.79226532286407}{100.53096491487338} \approx 1.7187968308.
