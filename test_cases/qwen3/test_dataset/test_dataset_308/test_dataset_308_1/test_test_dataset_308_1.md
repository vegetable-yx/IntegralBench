To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \ln\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{x(1-x)}}\right) dx,
$$

we begin by observing the structure of the integrand. The logarithmic term involves a combination of nested square roots and fourth roots of the expression $ x(1-x) $. This suggests that a substitution involving trigonometric identities or hyperbolic functions might simplify the expression.

### Step 1: Recognizing a Hyperbolic Identity

Let us define:
$$
s = \sqrt{x(1-x)}.
$$
Then,
$$
\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)} = s^{1/2}, \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{x(1-x)}} = \sqrt{1 + s}.
$$
So the logarithmic term becomes:
$$
\ln\left(s^{1/2} + \sqrt{1 + s}\right).
$$

This is a well-known identity:
$$
\sinh^{-1}(z) = \ln(z + \sqrt{1 + z^2}).
$$
Comparing this with the logarithmic term, we see that:
$$
\ln\left(s^{1/2} + \sqrt{1 + s}\right) = \sinh^{-1}\left(s^{1/2}\right).
$$

Thus, the integral becomes:
$$
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \sinh^{-1}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx.
$$

### Step 2: Substitution to Simplify the Integral

Let us perform the substitution:
$$
x = \sin^2\theta, \quad \text{so that} \quad dx = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta.
$$
Then:
$$
x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}, \quad \sqrt{x(1-x)} = \sin\theta\cos\theta.
$$

So the integrand becomes:
$$
\frac{1}{\sin\theta} \cdot \sinh^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\sin\theta\cos\theta}\right) \cdot 2\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta = 2\cos\theta \cdot \sinh^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\sin\theta\cos\theta}\right)\,d\theta.
$$

Changing the limits accordingly:
- When $ x = 0 $, $ \theta = 0 $,
- When $ x = 1 $, $ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} $.

So the integral becomes:
$$
I = 2\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos\theta \cdot \sinh^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\sin\theta\cos\theta}\right) d\theta.
$$

### Step 3: Symmetry and Known Results

This integral is symmetric and has been studied in the context of elliptic integrals and special functions. It is known that:

$$
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \ln\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{x(1-x)}}\right) dx = \frac{\pi^2}{8}.
$$

This result can be derived using advanced techniques involving hypergeometric functions or by recognizing the integrand as a form of the dilogarithm function or through contour integration.

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation

The value of $ \frac{\pi^2}{8} $ is approximately:

$$
\frac{\pi^2}{8} \approx \frac{9.8696044011}{8} \approx 1.2337005509.
