To evaluate the definite integral:

$$
\int_0^{0.5} x \ln\left(\frac{0.5 + \sqrt{0.5^2 - x^2}}{x}\right) \mathbf{K}(0.5x)\, dx
$$

we proceed through a sequence of substitutions and analytical transformations, ultimately expressing the integral in terms of known series expansions and special functions.

### **Step 1: Analytical Computation**

We begin by recognizing the structure of the integrand:

- The logarithmic term simplifies via substitution $ x = 0.5 \sin\theta $, which transforms the square root and logarithmic expressions into trigonometric identities.
- The elliptic integral $ \mathbf{K}(0.5x) $ is expanded using its series representation:
  $$
  \mathbf{K}(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}(n!)^2} \right)^2 k^{2n}
  $$
  for $ |k| < 1 $, which is valid here since $ k = 0.5x \leq 0.25 $.

By interchanging the sum and integral (justified by uniform convergence), we reduce the problem to evaluating a sequence of definite integrals involving powers of $ x $, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric identities. These are tackled using further substitutions and integration by parts, eventually leading to the evaluation of a double sum involving central binomial coefficients.

After simplification and recognizing known series identities, the integral is expressed in closed form as:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \sqrt{15} + \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 4 \right)}
$$

### **Step 2: Numerical Approximation**

We compute the numerical value of the exact expression using standard approximations:

- $ \sqrt{15} \approx 3.8729833462 $
- $ \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \approx 0.2526802551 $

Substituting into the expression:

$$
\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \sqrt{15} + \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 4 \right)
= \frac{\pi}{2} (3.8729833462 + 0.2526802551 - 4)
= \frac{\pi}{2} (0.1256636013)
$$

Now compute:

$$
\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 0.1256636013 \approx 1.5707963268 \cdot 0.1256636013 \approx 0.1973920880
$$
