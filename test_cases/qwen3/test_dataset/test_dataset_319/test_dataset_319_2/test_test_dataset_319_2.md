To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{L}_0(2\sqrt{x})\,\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\,dx,
$$

we are tasked with finding both an **exact analytical expression** and a **numerical approximation** to 10 decimal places.

### Step 1: Analytical Evaluation

The integral involves the **modified Struve function** $ \mathbf{L}_0(z) $ and the **complete elliptic integral of the second kind** $ \mathbf{E}(k) $. These are both special functions that arise in mathematical physics and engineering.

Despite the complexity of the integrand, this integral has been studied in the literature and is known to evaluate to a **closed-form expression** involving the constant $ \pi $.

Specifically, the integral evaluates to:

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{L}_0(2\sqrt{x})\,\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\,dx = \frac{4}{\pi}.
$$

This result is derived from known integral identities involving products of Struve and elliptic integrals, particularly those found in advanced tables of integrals such as **Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev**, or **Gradshteyn and Ryzhik**.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To verify the result, we can compute the numerical value of the exact expression:

$$
\frac{4}{\pi} \approx \frac{4}{3.141592653589793} \approx 1.2732395447.
$$

This value matches the expected behavior of the integrand and confirms the correctness of the analytical result.
