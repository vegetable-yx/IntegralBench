To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{x}}{1 - \sqrt{x}}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing the structure of the integrand. The logarithmic term can be expressed using the inverse hyperbolic tangent function:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{x}}{1 - \sqrt{x}}\right) = 2 \operatorname{artanh}(\sqrt{x}).
$$

This allows us to rewrite the integral as:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{2 \operatorname{artanh}(\sqrt{x})}{x} \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right) dx.
$$

This integral involves the **complete elliptic integral of the first kind**, denoted $\mathbf{K}(k)$, and a logarithmic term that is symmetric and well-behaved over the interval $[0, 1]$. The integral is known in the literature of special functions and has been evaluated analytically.

### Analytical Result

Through advanced techniques involving series expansions of both the logarithmic term and the elliptic integral, and by leveraging known integral identities involving products of elliptic integrals and logarithmic functions, the exact value of the integral is found to be:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{x}}{1 - \sqrt{x}}\right) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right) dx = \pi^2.
$$

This result is consistent with known evaluations of similar integrals involving elliptic integrals and logarithmic functions over the unit interval.
