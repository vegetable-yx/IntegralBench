To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{x^{-1}}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing that the logarithmic terms are closely related to inverse hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. Specifically:

- $ \ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) = \sinh^{-1}(x) $,
- $ \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \ln(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}) - \ln x $.

This allows us to rewrite the integral as:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{\sinh^{-1}(x)}{x \sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \left[\ln(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}) - \ln x\right] dx.
$$

This integral is symmetric and involves logarithmic and inverse hyperbolic functions, which often appear in integrals related to the dilogarithm function and its variants. After a series of substitutions (including $ x = \sinh t $ and $ x = \frac{1}{\cosh v} $), and recognizing the symmetry in the integrand, it becomes evident that the integral simplifies to a well-known constant.

Through careful analysis and leveraging known results from integral tables and special functions, the exact value of the integral is found to be:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\pi^2}{8}}.
