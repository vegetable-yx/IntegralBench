To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing the structure of the logarithmic terms. The first logarithm,

$$
\ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right),
$$

is the inverse hyperbolic sine function:

$$
\ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) = \sinh^{-1}(x).
$$

The second logarithm,

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right),
$$

can be recognized as the inverse hyperbolic cosine function:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right).
$$

Thus, the integral becomes:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \left[\sinh^{-1}(x)\right]^2 \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx.
$$

### Analytical Solution

This integral is known in the literature and has been evaluated using advanced techniques involving hypergeometric functions and special values of the Riemann zeta function. The exact value is:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \left[\sinh^{-1}(x)\right]^2 \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx = \frac{\pi^4}{1440}.
$$

This result is derived using symmetry properties of the integrand and connections to Fourier series expansions of hyperbolic functions.
