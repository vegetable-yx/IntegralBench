To evaluate the definite integral:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing the structure of the logarithmic terms. The first logarithmic expression:

$$
\ln\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right)
$$

is equivalent to the inverse hyperbolic sine function:

$$
\sinh^{-1}(x).
$$

The second logarithmic expression:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)
$$

is equivalent to the inverse hyperbolic cosine of $ \frac{1}{x} $, i.e.:

$$
\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right).
$$

Thus, the integral becomes:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \left[\sinh^{-1}(x)\right]^2 \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx.
$$

This form reveals a structure that is amenable to analytical evaluation using known results involving products of inverse hyperbolic functions and powers of $ x $. In fact, this integral is a well-known result in the literature of definite integrals involving inverse hyperbolic functions and logarithmic expressions.
