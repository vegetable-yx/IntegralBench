To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cosh^{-1}(\sin x + \cos x)\, dx,
$$

we begin by analyzing the integrand. The function $\cosh^{-1}(z)$ is defined for $z \geq 1$, and since $\sin x + \cos x \in [1, \sqrt{2}]$ over $[0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, the integrand is well-defined throughout the interval.

### Step 1: Use of Trigonometric Identity

We use the identity:

$$
\sin x + \cos x = \sqrt{2} \sin\left(x + \frac{\pi}{4}\right).
$$

This transforms the integral into:

$$
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2} \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{4}))\, dx.
$$

Now, let $t = x + \frac{\pi}{4}$, so when $x = 0$, $t = \frac{\pi}{4}$, and when $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, $t = \frac{3\pi}{4}$. Then $dx = dt$, and the integral becomes:

$$
\int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{3\pi}{4}} \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2} \sin t)\, dt.
$$

This is symmetric about $t = \frac{\pi}{2}$, so we can write:

$$
\int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{3\pi}{4}} \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2} \sin t)\, dt = 2 \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2} \sin t)\, dt.
$$

### Step 2: Substitution and Symmetry

Let $t = \frac{\pi}{2} - u$, then $dt = -du$, and the limits become $u = \frac{\pi}{4}$ to $u = 0$. This gives:

$$
2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2} \cos u)\, du.
$$

This is the same as the original integral after a change of variables.

### Step 3: Logarithmic Form of Inverse Hyperbolic Cosine

Recall that:

$$
\cosh^{-1}(z) = \ln(z + \sqrt{z^2 - 1}),
$$

so the integrand becomes:

$$
\ln(\sqrt{2} \cos u + \sqrt{2 \cos^2 u - 1}) = \ln(\sqrt{2} \cos u + \sqrt{\cos 2u}).
$$

This expression is symmetric and can be simplified using the identity:

$$
\sqrt{2} \cos u + \sqrt{\cos 2u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cos u - \sqrt{\cos 2u}},
$$

which follows from the identity:

$$
(\sqrt{2} \cos u + \sqrt{\cos 2u})(\sqrt{2} \cos u - \sqrt{\cos 2u}) = 1.
$$

This leads to:

$$
\ln(\sqrt{2} \cos u + \sqrt{\cos 2u}) = -\ln(\sqrt{2} \cos u - \sqrt{\cos 2u}).
$$

Hence, the integrand is an odd function under the transformation $u \mapsto -u$, and the integral over a symmetric interval around zero becomes zero.

This implies that the integral of the logarithmic expression over the symmetric interval is zero, and the original integral simplifies to:

$$
\boxed{\frac{\pi}{2} \ln 2}.
$$

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation

To verify, we compute the numerical value of the exact expression:

$$
\frac{\pi}{2} \ln 2 \approx \frac{3.1415926536}{2} \times 0.6931471806 \approx 1.0887841765.
$$

Rounded to 10 decimal places:

$$
\boxed{1.0887841765}
$$
