To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^2 x^{-1/2} I_0\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)}\right) dx,
$$

we proceed by expanding the modified Bessel function $ I_0(z) $ in its power series representation:

$$
I_0(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^{2k}}{(k!)^2 4^k}.
$$

Substituting $ z = \sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)} $, we get:

$$
I_0\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)}\right) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\left(x(2 - x)\right)^{k/2}}{(k!)^2 4^k}.
$$

Now, inserting this into the integral:

$$
\int_0^2 x^{-1/2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\left(x(2 - x)\right)^{k/2}}{(k!)^2 4^k} dx.
$$

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the sum and integral:

$$
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(k!)^2 4^k} \int_0^2 x^{(k - 1)/2} (2 - x)^{k/2} dx.
$$

This integral is recognized as a form of the Beta function:

$$
\int_0^2 x^{(k - 1)/2} (2 - x)^{k/2} dx = 2^{k + 1} B\left(\frac{k + 1}{2}, \frac{k + 2}{2}\right).
$$

Using the identity $ B(a, b) = \frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a + b)} $, and applying the duplication formula for gamma functions, we simplify the expression and eventually find that the integral reduces to:

$$
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{2^{3/2}}{(2k + 1)!}.
$$

This series is recognized as the expansion of $ \sinh(1) $, since:

$$
\sinh(1) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k + 1)!}.
$$

Thus, the integral evaluates exactly to:

$$
2\sqrt{2} \sinh(1).
$$

### Numerical Approximation

We compute the numerical value using the known value of $ \sinh(1) \approx 1.1752011936438013 $, and $ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135623730951 $:

$$
2\sqrt{2} \sinh(1) \approx 2.8284271247461903 \times 1.1752011936438013 \approx 3.3239709336.
