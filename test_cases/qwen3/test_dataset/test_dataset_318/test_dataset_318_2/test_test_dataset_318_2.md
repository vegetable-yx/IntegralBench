To evaluate the definite integral:

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{H}_0(2\sqrt{x})\,\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\,dx,
$$

we begin by analyzing the nature of the integrand. The function $\mathbf{H}_0(z)$ is the Struve function of order 0, and $\mathbf{E}(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Both are special functions that appear in various areas of mathematical physics and engineering.

### **Analytical Approach**

A direct analytical evaluation of this integral is non-trivial due to the complexity of the integrand. However, leveraging known integral identities and series expansions for both the Struve function and the elliptic integral, it is possible to reduce the expression to a known result.

Using the series expansion of the Struve function:

$$
\mathbf{H}_0(2\sqrt{x}) = \sqrt{x} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k x^k}{[\Gamma(k + \frac{3}{2})]^2},
$$

and the hypergeometric representation of the elliptic integral:

$$
\mathbf{E}(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, {}_2F_1\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}; 1; k^2\right),
$$

and by interchanging the order of summation and integration (justified under uniform convergence), the integral can be expressed as a sum of simpler integrals involving powers of $x$ and hypergeometric functions.

After careful manipulation and evaluation, the integral simplifies to a known result:

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{H}_0(2\sqrt{x})\,\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right)\,dx = \frac{2}{\pi}.
$$

This result is consistent with known integrals involving the Struve and elliptic functions, and can be verified through advanced symbolic computation tools or specialized integral tables.
