To solve the definite integral:

$$
\int_0^2 x^3 \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right) I_0(x) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing the complexity introduced by the logarithmic term and the modified Bessel function $ I_0(x) $. The integrand combines a polynomial, a logarithmic expression, and a special function, making direct analytical evaluation challenging without known identities or transformations.

### Key Observations and Transformations

The logarithmic term can be simplified using the identity:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{x}\right),
$$

which allows us to rewrite the integral as:

$$
\int_0^2 x^3 \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{x}\right) I_0(x) \, dx.
$$

This substitution is crucial because it connects the integrand to known integral representations involving modified Bessel functions and inverse hyperbolic functions.

### Analytical Evaluation

Through a detailed process of substitution and integration by parts (as outlined in the thought process), and leveraging known recurrence relations for modified Bessel functions, the integral simplifies to an expression involving $ I_1(2) $, the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 1 evaluated at 2.

Specifically, the integral evaluates to:

$$
\boxed{8 I_1(2)}
$$

This result arises from recognizing that the logarithmic term, when differentiated, simplifies significantly, and the resulting integral can be expressed in terms of known Bessel function identities.

### Numerical Approximation

Using the known value:

$$
I_1(2) \approx 1.590636854637331,
$$

we compute:

$$
8 \cdot I_1(2) \approx 8 \cdot 1.590636854637331 = 12.725094837098648.
$$

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical value is:

$$
\boxed{12.7250948371}
$$
