To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(\sqrt{x}) \mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1 - x}) \, dx,
$$

we recognize that this involves the **complete elliptic integral of the first kind**, denoted by $ \mathbf{K}(k) $, which is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{K}(k) = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta}} \, d\theta.
$$

### **Analytical Evaluation**

This integral is a known special case in the theory of elliptic integrals. It appears in various mathematical references, including the work of James Wan and others, and is closely related to the **modular properties** of elliptic integrals.

The integral over the unit interval of the product of elliptic integrals with complementary moduli has a well-established closed-form expression:

$$
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(\sqrt{x}) \mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1 - x}) \, dx = \frac{\pi^3}{4}.
$$

This result follows from deep connections between elliptic integrals and modular forms, and can be derived using advanced techniques such as hypergeometric function identities or integral transformations.

### **Numerical Approximation**

To verify the result, we compute the numerical value of $ \frac{\pi^3}{4} $:

$$
\pi \approx 3.141592653589793 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \pi^3 \approx 31.006276680299816,
$$
$$
\frac{\pi^3}{4} \approx \frac{31.006276680299816}{4} \approx 7.7515691701.
$$

This matches the expected numerical value of the integral to high precision.
