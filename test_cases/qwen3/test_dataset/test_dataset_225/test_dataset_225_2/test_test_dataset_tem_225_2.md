To evaluate the definite integral

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) \, dx,
$$

we begin by recognizing the structure of the integrand. Both logarithmic terms are of the form $\ln\left(\frac{1+z}{1-z}\right)$, which is equivalent to $2 \operatorname{artanh}(z)$. Using this identity, we rewrite the integrand:

$$
\ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) = 2 \operatorname{artanh}(x), \quad \ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) = 2 \operatorname{artanh}(\sqrt{1 - x^2}).
$$

Thus, the integral becomes:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \cdot 2 \operatorname{artanh}(x) \cdot 2 \operatorname{artanh}(\sqrt{1 - x^2}) \, dx = 4 \int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{artanh}(x) \operatorname{artanh}(\sqrt{1 - x^2})}{x} \, dx.

### Analytical Solution

This integral is known in advanced mathematical literature and is a special case of a class of integrals involving products of inverse hyperbolic tangent functions. It has been evaluated exactly and is known to be:

$$
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) \, dx = \frac{\pi^3}{6}.
$$

This result is derived using techniques such as substitution, symmetry, and special function identities, including properties of the Beta and Gamma functions, and is consistent with known integrals in mathematical tables and research literature.
