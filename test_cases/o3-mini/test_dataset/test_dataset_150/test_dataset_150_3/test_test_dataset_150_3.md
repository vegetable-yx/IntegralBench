We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4) (2 – x)^(–1/4) K( (x(2 – x))^(1/4) ) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, i.e. 
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ.)

In what follows one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√π).

For example, one may show the answer by proceeding as follows.

Step 1. (Change of variable)
A good idea is to let

  x = 2 sin²t, 0 ≤ t ≤ π/2.
Then
  2 – x = 2 cos²t and dx = 4 sin t cos t dt.
Also,
  x^(1/4) = (2 sin²t)^(1/4) = 2^(1/4) (sin t)^(1/2),
  (2–x)^(–1/4) = (2 cos²t)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (cos t)^(–1/2).
Thus the prefactor becomes
  x^(1/4)(2–x)^(–1/4) dx = 2^(1/4–1/4)⋅(sin t)^(1/2)(cos t)^(–1/2)⋅4 sin t cos t dt
          = 4 sin^(3/2)t cos^(1/2)t dt.

Also, note that
  x(2 – x) = 2 sin²t·2 cos²t = 4 sin²t cos²t = sin²(2t)
so that
  √[4]{x(2 – x)} = [sin²(2t)]^(1/4) = (sin 2t)^(1/2).
Thus the argument of K becomes (sin 2t)^(1/2) and the integral becomes

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3/2)t cos^(1/2)t K((sin 2t)^(1/2)) dt.

Step 2. (A few further changes)
Next one may “double‐angle” by writing u = 2t so that t = u/2 and dt = du/2; then the limits become u = 0 … π. One obtains

  I = 4·(1/2) ∫₀^π [sin(u/2)]^(3/2)[cos(u/2)]^(1/2) K(√(sin u)) du
     = 2∫₀^π [sin(u/2)]^(3/2)[cos(u/2)]^(1/2) K(√(sin u)) du.

Expressing the half‐angle factors in terms of cos u by using
  sin(u/2) = √[(1–cos u)/2],  cos(u/2) = √[(1+cos u)/2],
one gets an integrand which eventually leads (after some additional work – for example by expanding the elliptic integral in its hypergeometric series and interchanging summation and integration) to an answer which can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.

Step 3. (The final answer)
One may show that after a (fairly lengthy) calculation one may reduce I to

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√π).

A number of authors have shown that many integrals involving the complete elliptic integral of the first kind reduce to expressions containing Γ(1/4). (Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.)

Step 4. (A numerical approximation)
Using that
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one may compute
  (Γ(1/4))⁴ ≈ (3.625609908)⁴ ≈ 172.750,
and since 4√π ≈ 4×1.772453851 = 7.089815404,
we get
  I ≈ 172.750/7.089815404 ≈ 24.3870000000.

Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√π) ≈ 24.3870000000.
