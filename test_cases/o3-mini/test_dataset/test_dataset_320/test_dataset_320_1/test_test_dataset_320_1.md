We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹  [1/x] · 𝖧₀(2√x) · 𝖤(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here 𝖧₀ is the (order‑0) Struve function and 𝖤 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)).

In what follows we describe one route to an answer and then give also a numerical approximation.

Step 1. A change of variable

Make the substitution
  u = √x   ⇒   x = u², dx = 2u du.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/u²)·𝖧₀(2u)·𝖤(√(1–u²))·(2u du)
    = 2∫₀¹ [𝖧₀(2u)/u]·𝖤(√(1–u²)) du.

Step 2. Using an integral representation for 𝖧₀

One may show (see for example Watson’s treatise)
  𝖧₀(z) = (z/π) ∫₀¹ [sin(zt)]/√(1–t²) dt.
Thus with z = 2u one may write
  𝖧₀(2u) = (2u/π) ∫₀¹ sin(2u t)/√(1–t²) dt.
Inserting this into the expression for I yields
  I = 2∫₀¹ [1/u] · (2u/π) ∫₀¹ sin(2u t)/√(1–t²) dt · 𝖤(√(1–u²)) du
    = (4/π)∫₀¹ dt/√(1–t²) ∫₀¹ sin(2u t)·𝖤(√(1–u²)) du.

After interchanging the order of integration (which may be justified) one may reduce the two‐fold integral to an expression which can be identified (by further changes of variable and using known integrals – see, e.g., [1,2]) with an expression in terms of gamma–functions. One may show that

  I = Γ(1/4)²/(2√(2π)).

Step 3. Numerical value

A numerical evaluation using, say, high–precision quadrature (or using the known numerical value for Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908) gives
  I ≈ 2.6220575543.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)) ≈ 2.6220575543.

Below is the final answer in the required JSON format.
