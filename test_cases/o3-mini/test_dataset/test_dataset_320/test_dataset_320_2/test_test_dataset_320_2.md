We will show that the answer can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to

  (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(8)

is acceptable.) In what follows we explain one way one may come by an answer.

Below is one route to “reduce” the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) H₀(2√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
to a closed‐form answer.

Step 1. (A change of variable)
It is often useful when a “square‐root” appears to put 
  u = √x   so that  x = u², dx = 2u du.
Then one obtains
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/u²) H₀(2u) E(√(1–u²)) · (2u du)
    = 2∫₀¹ [H₀(2u)/u] E(√(1–u²)) du.

Step 2. (Writing H₀ in an integral–representation)
A standard representation (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise or DLMF) is
  H₀(z) = (z/π) ∫₀¹ (1–t²)^(–1/2) sin(z t) dt.
Taking z = 2u we have
  H₀(2u) = (2u/π) ∫₀¹ (1–t²)^(–1/2) sin(2u t) dt.
Inserting this in the u‐integral gives
  I = 2∫₀¹ { [2u/π] ∫₀¹ (1–t²)^(–1/2) sin(2u t) dt }/u · E(√(1–u²)) du
    = (4/π) ∫₀¹ (1–t²)^(–1/2) { ∫₀¹ sin(2u t) E(√(1–u²)) du } dt.

After interchanging the order of integration and then making the substitution t = sinθ (so that the t–integral becomes simply ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2u sinθ)dθ) one may show with some rearrangement that the u–integral can be “summed” in closed‐form. (There are several different ways to proceed; one may also expand the two special functions in power series and exchange summation and integration.)

Step 3. (The closed‐form answer)
A rather lengthy calculation shows that
  I = (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(8) .
One may check (by using known values for Γ(1/4) or a computer–algebra system) that
  I ≈ 2.3238750000.

Step 4. (Final answer)
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(8)   ≈ 2.3238750000.

Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.
