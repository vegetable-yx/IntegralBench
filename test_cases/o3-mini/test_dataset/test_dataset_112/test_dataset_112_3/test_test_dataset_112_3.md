One acceptable answer was to show that our original integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/4) (2–x)^(–5/4) Li₂(0.5√(x(2–x))) dx
may be written in “closed‐form” as

  I = (1/2) Σₙ₌₁^∞ [Γ(n/2 + 1/4) Γ(n/2 – 1/4)]⁄[n² Γ(n)] .

One may prove that by the change of variable
  u = x/2        (so that x = 2u, dx = 2du)
one obtains
  I = (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^(–3/4)(1–u)^(–5/4) Li₂(√(u(1–u))) du.
Then writing the dilogarithm in its Taylor series,
  Li₂(z) = Σₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n²  (for |z| ≤ 1)
and interchanging sum and integral (which may be justified) one finds that
  I = (1/2) Σₙ₌₁∞ (1/n²) ∫₀¹ u^(n/2–3/4)[1–u]^(n/2–5/4) du.
But the u–integral is a beta–integral so that
  ∫₀¹ u^(n/2–3/4)(1–u)^(n/2–5/4) du = B(n/2+1/4, n/2–1/4)
= [Γ(n/2+1/4) Γ(n/2–1/4)]⁄Γ(n).
Thus one obtains

  I = (1/2) Σₙ₌₁∞ [Γ(n/2+1/4) Γ(n/2–1/4)]⁄[n² Γ(n)] .

This answer is “exact” in that it expresses the answer in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and an infinite sum. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 2.3890097886 .
