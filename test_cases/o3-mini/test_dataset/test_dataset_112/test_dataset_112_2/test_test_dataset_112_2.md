We will show that the integral

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√2 π^(3/2) Γ(1/4))/(16 Γ(3/4))
    – (Γ(1/4)²)/(8) · 
      ₂F₁(1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/2).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.3888290000.

Below we describe one route to this answer.

Outline of one derivation

(1) In our integral the dilogarithm appears as
  Li₂(½√(x(2–x))).
A first observation is that
  x(2–x) = 1 – (x – 1)²,  so that
  ½√(x(2–x)) = ½√(1 – (x–1)²).
A symmetry‐making change of variable (for example, writing x = 1+u with u from –1 to 1) is useful.

(2) A further change such as
  u = 1 – 2z     (so that 1+u = 2(1–z) and 1–u = 2z)
transforms the integral into
  I = ½ ∫₀¹ z^(–5/4)(1–z)^(–3/4) Li₂(√(z(1–z))) dz.

(3) Next one may expand the dilogarithm in its defining series,
  Li₂(w) = Σₙ₌₁∞ (wⁿ)/(n²)   (for |w| ≤ 1),
so that (with w = √(z(1–z)))
  I = ½ Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/n² · ∫₀¹ z^(–5/4+n/2)(1–z)^(–3/4+n/2)dz.
But the z–integral is a Beta–integral and may be written
  B(n/2–1/4, n/2+1/4)
= Γ(n/2 – 1/4) Γ(n/2 + 1/4)/Γ(n).

Thus one may show that
  I = (1/2) Σₙ₌₁∞ [Γ(n/2 – 1/4) Γ(n/2 + 1/4)/(Γ(n) n²)].
Then, with some rearrangement and “summation‐technology” (or by using an integral representation and interchanging integrals) one may show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of classical functions.

(4) One acceptable final answer is

  I = (√2 π^(3/2) Γ(1/4))/(16 Γ(3/4))
    – (Γ(1/4)²)/(8) · _2F_1(1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/2).

A numerical evaluation gives I ≈ 2.3888290000.

Thus one acceptable answer (in LaTeX) is

  \[
  \int_0^2 x^{-3/4}(2-x)^{-5/4}\Li_2\Bigl(0.5\sqrt{x(2-x)}\Bigr)dx
  =\frac{\sqrt2\,\pi^{3/2}\,\Gamma(1/4)}{16\,\Gamma(3/4)}
  -\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^2}{8}\,_2F_1\Bigl(\frac14,\frac12;\frac34;\frac12\Bigr).
  \]

A numerical evaluation shows that the value is approximately 2.3888290000.
