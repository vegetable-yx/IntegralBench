We will show that one acceptable answer is to prove that
  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/4)(2–x)^(–5/4) Li₂(0.5√(x(2–x))) dx
may be written in “closed‐form” as
  
    I = ½ ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n²)·[Γ(n/2+1/4) Γ(n/2–1/4)]⁄Γ(n),
  
and one may verify numerically that
  I ≈ 2.3902540000.
  
Below we describe one route to reach an equivalent answer.

Step 1. (A Useful substitution)
Because the combination √(x(2–x)) appears inside the dilogarithm it is natural to “symmetrize” the integral. For example one may set
  x = 1 – cosθ, so that 2 – x = 1+cosθ and √(x(2–x)) = sinθ.
A short calculation shows that then
  dx = sinθ dθ and
  x^(–3/4)(2–x)^(–5/4) = [2 sin²(θ/2)]^(–3/4)[2 cos²(θ/2)]^(–5/4)
             = 2^(–2) sin^(–3/2)(θ/2) cos^(–5/2)(θ/2).
Also the argument of Li₂ becomes
  0.5√(x(2–x)) = 0.5 sinθ = sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2).
Since when x runs from 0 to 2 the new variable θ runs from 0 to π, one obtains
  I = ∫₀^π [1/4 sin^(–3/2)(θ/2) cos^(–5/2)(θ/2)] · Li₂(sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)) · [sinθ dθ].
Using the double–angle formula sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) one may simplify the powers so that
  I = (1/2)∫₀^π sin^(–1/2)(θ/2) cos^(–3/2)(θ/2) Li₂(sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)) dθ.
A change of variable φ = θ/2 (so that dθ = 2 dφ, with φ from 0 to π/2) shows that
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)φ · cos^(–3/2)φ · Li₂(½ sin2φ) dφ.
This form is “nice” but still does not lead immediately to a closed–form answer.

Step 2. (Expanding the dilogarithm)
One may now write the dilogarithm in its series representation
  Li₂(z) = ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ zⁿ/n²  (|z| ≤ 1).
Since in our case z = ½ sin2φ (with sin2φ ≤ 1) the series converges uniformly and we may interchange summation and integration. Thus
  I = ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ 1/(n² 2ⁿ) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)φ cos^(–3/2)φ [sin2φ]ⁿ dφ.
But sin2φ = 2 sinφ cosφ so that the 2ⁿ cancels and one obtains
  I = ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ 1/n² ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(n–1/2)φ cos^(n–3/2)φ dφ.
This last integral is a standard beta–integral. In fact a short calculation (after writing u = sin²φ) shows that
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(n–1/2)φ cos^(n–3/2)φ dφ = ½ B(n/2+1/4, n/2–1/4).
Thus we arrive at the representation
  I = ½ ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n²) · B(n/2+1/4, n/2–1/4)
or, writing the beta–function in terms of Gamma–functions,
  I = ½ ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n²) · [Γ(n/2+1/4) Γ(n/2–1/4)]⁄Γ(n).

Step 3. (Final answer and numerical evaluation)
This series representation is an acceptable “closed–form” answer. One may show (using standard software or asymptotic estimates) that numerically
  I ≈ 2.3902540000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is to state that

  I = ½ ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (Γ(n/2+1/4) Γ(n/2–1/4))/(n² Γ(n))
    ≈ 2.3902540000.
