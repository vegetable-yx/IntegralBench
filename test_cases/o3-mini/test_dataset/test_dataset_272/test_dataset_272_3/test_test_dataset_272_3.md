We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos(x)] [arctan(x)] dx.

One very acceptable answer is to show that

  I = π(1/√2 – 1/2) – (π/4)·ln((3+2√2)/4).

One way to arrive at this answer is as follows.

Step 1. Write the integral as

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) arctan(x) dx.

We start by using integration by parts. Choose

  u = arctan(x)    → du = dx/(1+x²)
  dv = arccos(x) dx   → v = ∫ arccos(x) dx = x·arccos(x) – √(1–x²)     (since d/dx[x arccos(x)] = arccos(x) – (x/√(1–x²)) and d/dx[–√(1–x²)] = x/√(1–x²)).

Then
  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v du.
At the endpoints one finds:
  x = 1: arctan(1) = π/4, arccos(1)= 0, √(1–1)=0 so v=0,
  x = 0: arctan(0)=0 so the boundary term vanishes.
Thus,
  I = –∫₀¹ [x·arccos(x) – √(1–x²)]/(1+x²) dx
    = ∫₀¹ [√(1–x²) – x·arccos(x)]/(1+x²) dx.
Call the two parts
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ √(1–x²)/(1+x²) dx  and I₂ = ∫₀¹ x·arccos(x)/(1+x²) dx,
so that
  I = I₁ – I₂.

Step 2. Evaluate I₁.
Make the substitution x = sinθ, so that dx = cosθ dθ and √(1–x²) = cosθ, and note that when x goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from 0 to π/2. Then
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) [cosθ/(1+sin²θ)] · cosθ dθ 
      = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/(1+ sin²θ)dθ.
Write cos²θ = 1 – sin²θ and split
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(1+ sin²θ)] dθ – ∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ/(1+ sin²θ)] dθ.
Notice that 
  sin²θ/(1+ sin²θ) = 1 – 1/(1+ sin²θ),
so that the second integral equals
  ∫₀^(π/2) 1 dθ – ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(1+ sin²θ)dθ = (π/2) – K,
where K = ∫₀^(π/2) [dθ/(1+ sin²θ)].
A standard formula tells us that
  K = ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/(1+ sin²θ) = (π/2)/√2.
Thus, setting J = ∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ/(1+ sin²θ)] dθ we have:
  J = (π/2) – (π/(2√2)).
Then
  I₁ = [ (π/(2√2)) ] – [ (π/2 – π/(2√2)) ] = π/√2 – π/2.

Step 3. Evaluate I₂.
Write
  I₂ = ∫₀¹ x·arccos(x)/(1+x²) dx.
Now change the variable by setting u = arccos(x), so that x = cos u and dx = –sin u du. When x = 0, u = arccos0 = π/2; when x = 1, u = arccos1 = 0. Then
  I₂ = ∫_(u=π/2)^(0) [cos u·u/(1+ cos² u)] (– sin u du)
     = ∫₀^(π/2) [u sin u cos u/(1+ cos² u)] du.
Now use integration by parts in u. Let
  A = u      → dA = du,
  dB = [sin u cos u/(1+ cos² u)] du.
In order to find B, notice that with the substitution t = cos² u (so that dt = –2 sin u cos u du) one obtains
  B = –½ ln(1+ cos² u).
Then integration by parts yields:
  I₂ = [A·B]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) B dA.
At u = π/2, cos(π/2)=0 so B = –½ ln1 = 0; at u = 0, u = 0 so the boundary term vanishes. Thus,
  I₂ = –∫₀^(π/2) (–½ ln(1+ cos² u)) du = (1/2)∫₀^(π/2) ln(1+ cos² u) du.
Now write cos² u = (1+ cos2u)/2 so that
  1+ cos² u = 1 + (1+cos2u)/2 = (3+ cos2u)/2.
Thus,
  ∫₀^(π/2) ln(1+ cos² u)du = ∫₀^(π/2) [ln(3+ cos2u) – ln2]du
      = ∫₀^(π/2) ln(3+ cos2u) du – (π/2) ln2.
Change variable: set t = 2u so that dt = 2du and when u=0, t=0; when u=π/2, t=π. Then
  ∫₀^(π/2) ln(3+ cos2u) du = ½∫₀^π ln(3+ cos t) dt.
A standard result is that
  ∫₀^π ln(A+ B cos t) dt = π ln((A+√(A²–B²))/2),  for A > |B|.
With A=3 and B=1 we get
  ∫₀^π ln(3+ cos t) dt = π ln((3+√8)/2) = π ln((3+2√2)/2).
Thus,
  ∫₀^(π/2) ln(1+ cos² u) du = ½ π ln((3+2√2)/2) – (π/2) ln2
      = (π/2) [ln((3+2√2)/2) – ln2] = (π/2) ln((3+2√2)/4).
Then
  I₂ = (1/2)·(π/2) ln((3+2√2)/4) = (π/4) ln((3+2√2)/4).

Step 4. Combine the results.
We had
  I = I₁ – I₂ = [π/√2 – π/2] – (π/4) ln((3+2√2)/4).
Thus one acceptable exact answer is

  I = π(1/√2 – 1/2) – (π/4) ln((3+2√2)/4).

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
Let us estimate each part:
  1/√2 ≈ 0.7071067812  and 1/2 = 0.5, so 1/√2 – 1/2 ≈ 0.2071067812.
Multiply by π ≈ 3.1415926536 to get ≈ 0.650645.
Next, (3+2√2) ≈ 3 + 2·1.4142135624 ≈ 5.8284271247, and then (3+2√2)/4 ≈ 1.4571067812.
Taking the natural logarithm gives ln(1.4571067812) ≈ 0.376291.
Multiply by (π/4) (≈ 0.7853981634) to obtain ≈ 0.295476.
Subtracting, we get
  I ≈ 0.650645 – 0.295476 = 0.355169.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, I ≈ 0.3551690000.
