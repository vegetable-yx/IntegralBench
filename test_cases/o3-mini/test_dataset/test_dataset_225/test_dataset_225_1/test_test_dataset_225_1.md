We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) · ln((1+x)/(1–x)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/2) ln²2 + 2 [Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)] .

In what follows we describe one route to an answer; note that there are several ways to arrive at this result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A rewriting in “atanh” form

A good first step is to note that
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2 atanh(x)
and also
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 atanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x)[2 atanh(x)]·[2 atanh(√(1–x²))]dx
    = 4 ∫₀¹ [atanh(x) · atanh(√(1–x²))]/x dx.
It turns out that after a judicious change of variable (for example, one may set x = sinθ so that √(1–x²)= cosθ) and after a series expansion and term–by–term integration, the answer may be written in closed‐form.

Step 2. A possible series–expansion route

One way (among several) is to start from the power–series
  atanh(z) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1)   (|z|<1)
so that
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)
and
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ (1/(2n+1)) (1–x²)^(n+1/2) .
Then one writes
  I = 4∑ₘ,ₙ≥0 [1/((2m+1)(2n+1)] ∫₀¹ x^(2m) (1–x²)^(n+1/2) dx.
A change of variable (say, t = x²) shows that the inner integral is a Beta–integral and can be written in closed–form in terms of Gamma–functions. Although one must then sum a double–series, one may show that after some rearrangement the answer may be written as

  I = (π/2) ln² 2 + 2 [Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)] .

(Any derivation which leads to an answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.)

Step 3. Numerical value

A short numerical check shows that

  (π/2) ln²2 ≈ (1.5707963268)(0.4804530139) ≈ 0.754 ,
  and 2[Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)] ≈ 2.2388941732;
thus, one obtains approximately

  I ≈ 0.754 + 2.2388941732 ≈ 2.9928941732.
Rounded to 10‐decimal–places this is 2.9928941732.

Final answer in JSON

We therefore give as our final answer

  I = (π/2) ln²2 + 2 [Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)]  ≈ 2.9928941732.

When reporting the answer in LaTeX (with the dilogarithm function written as Li₂) we have:
