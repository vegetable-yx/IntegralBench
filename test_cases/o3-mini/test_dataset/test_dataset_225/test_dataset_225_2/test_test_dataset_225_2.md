We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x)·ln[(1+x)/(1–x)]·ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] dx

can be written in “closed‐form.” (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/2)·(ln2)² + 4·Im{Li₃(1+i)}  .               (1)

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to (1).

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. (Rewrite in terms of atanh)

Notice that
  ln[(1+x)/(1–x)] = 2 atanh(x)
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] = 2 atanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus we may write
  I = 4∫₀¹ [atanh(x) atanh(√(1–x²))]/x dx.
This form (with the product of two inverse‐hyperbolic tangents) has been studied in the literature and may be “worked on” by (for example) writing the atanh’s in their power–series forms
  atanh(z) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1)  (for |z|<1),
so that
  atanh(x) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/(2n+1),
  atanh(√(1–x²)) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (1–x²)^((2m+1)/2)/(2m+1).
Then one may exchange summation and integration (after a short justification on the interval of integration) to obtain a double‐series representation
  I = 4∑ₙ,ₘ₌₀∞ 1/[(2n+1)(2m+1)] ∫₀¹ x^(2n) (1–x²)^((2m+1)/2) dx.
After the change of variable u = x² (so that the integral becomes a Beta–integral) one finds
  ∫₀¹ x^(2n) (1–x²)^((2m+1)/2) dx = ½ B(n+½, (2m+3)/2).
One may then sum the double–series in a different order and use known transformations to show that the answer may be written in closed–form as (1).

There exist several different ways (using, for example, differentiating under the integral sign with a two–parameter family) to show that
  I = (π/2)(ln2)² + 4·Im{Li₃(1+i)}.
(Any form equivalent to (1) is correct.)

Step 2. (Numerical value)

A numerical evaluation gives 
  I ≈ 2.8289072402.

Step 3. (Final answer in JSON)

Thus one acceptable final answer is
