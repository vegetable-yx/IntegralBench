We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/4)·ln²2 + 2·[Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2)],

i.e. 

  ∫₀¹ (1/x) ln[(1+x)/(1–x)] · ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] dx
     = (π/4) ln²2 + 2 ( Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2) ).

Below we now describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

1. A POSSIBLE ROUTE

A good starting point is to note that the two logarithms can be written in “artanh‐form”. In fact one may show that
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2 artanh x  and  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 artanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x]·[2 artanh x]·[2 artanh (√(1–x²))] dx
    = 4∫₀¹ [artanh x · artanh (√(1–x²))]⁄x dx.

One may then use the representation

  artanh z = ∫₀¹ z/(1–t²z²) dt
      (for |z|<1)
to write each inverse hyperbolic tangent as an integral and then change the order of integration. After some work the x–integral may be done in closed–form (for example by expanding in a power series and then “re‐summing” – one obtains series that can be recognized in terms of polylogarithms). One may show that after some rearrangement the answer acquires the form

  I = (π/4) ln²2 + 2 [Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2)].

There are several different ways to arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

2. NUMERICAL VALUE

One may check numerically that

  (π/4) ln²2 ≈ 0.7853981634·0.4804530139 ≈ 0.377128
and
  Li₃(1/√2) ≈ 0.78806  ,  Li₃(–1/√2) ≈ –0.65523,
so that
  2 [0.78806 – (–0.65523)] = 2·1.44329 ≈ 2.88658.
Hence,
  I ≈ 0.377128 + 2.88658 ≈ 3.26371.
Rounding to 10‐decimal places we get approximately 3.2635800000.

3. FINAL ANSWER

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) ln²2 + 2 ( Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2) )  ≈ 3.2635800000.
