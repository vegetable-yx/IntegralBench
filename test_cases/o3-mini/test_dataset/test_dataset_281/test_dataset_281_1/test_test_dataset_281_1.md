We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–1/4) (4–x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4–x))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. (Rescaling)

A good first step is to “remove” the constant 4 from the limits. With the change of variable

  x = 4u   (so that u runs from 0 to 1)  and dx = 4 du,
  4 – x = 4(1 – u).

Then
  x^(–1/4) = (4u)^(–1/4) = 4^(–1/4) u^(–1/4)
  (4–x)^(–3/4) = [4(1–u)]^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/4) (1–u)^(–3/4).

Also,
  √(x(4–x)) = √(4u · 4(1–u)) = 4√(u(1–u)),
so that
  cosh(2√(x(4–x))) = cosh(2·4√(u(1–u))) = cosh(8√(u(1–u))).

Collecting all factors the integrand times dx becomes

  [4^(–1/4) u^(–1/4)] · [4^(–3/4) (1–u)^(–3/4)] · cosh(8√(u(1–u))) · 4 du.

Since 4^(–1/4)4^(–3/4)=4^(–1) and 4×4^(–1)=1 the constant factors cancel and we obtain

  I = ∫₀¹ u^(–1/4) (1–u)^(–3/4) cosh(8√(u(1–u))) du.

Step 2. (Recognizing a standard form)

It turns out that integrals of the form

  ∫₀¹ t^(μ–1)(1–t)^(ν–1) cosh(2α√(t(1–t))) dt
    = B(μ, ν) · _0F₁(; μ+ν; α²)
                                       (1)

when the parameters are chosen appropriately. (A proof uses the power‐series expansion of the hyperbolic cosine and then the definition of the Beta–integral.)

In our case we note that
  u^(–1/4) = u^( (3/4)–1)  and (1–u)^(–3/4) = (1–u)^( (1/4)–1).
Thus one may identify
  μ = 3/4  and ν = 1/4.
Also, comparing cosh(8√(u(1–u))) with cosh(2α√(u(1–u))), we must have

  2α = 8  ⟹ α = 4.

Then (1) gives

  I = B(3/4, 1/4) · _0F₁(; 3/4+1/4; 4²)
    = B(3/4, 1/4) · _0F₁(; 1; 16).

But a standard relation shows that
  _0F₁(;1;16) = Σₙ₌₀∞ (16ⁿ/(n!)²) = I₀(8),
since in general
  I₀(z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ ((z/2)^(2n))/(n!)²  ⇒ _0F₁(;1;z) = I₀(2√z)
with z = 16 (so that 2√16 = 8).

Also, the Beta–function is
  B(3/4, 1/4) = (Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4))/(Γ(1)) = Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4).
But the reflection formula for the Gamma–function tells us that
  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π√2.

Thus we deduce that

  I = (π√2) I₀(8).

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)

The modified Bessel function I₀(8) may be evaluated using standard software or a table. One finds that

  I₀(8) ≈ 427.564115721

and hence

  I ≈ π√2 × 427.564115721 ≈ 4.442882938158366 × 427.564115721 ≈ 1899.6931753.

Step 4. (Final answer in JSON)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = π√2 · I₀(8)   and numerically ≈ 1899.6931753.

The final answer in the required JSON format is shown on the last line.
