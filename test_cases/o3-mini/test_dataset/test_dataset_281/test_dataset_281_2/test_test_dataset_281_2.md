We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–1/4) (4 – x)^(–3/4) cosh (2√(x(4 – x))) dx

may be written in “closed form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. The “β–integral” form

A very useful fact is that for parameters μ, ν > 0 one has
  ∫₀ᵃ x^(μ–1) (a – x)^(ν–1) cosh [2√(β x(a – x))] dx
   = Γ(μ)Γ(ν)·a^(μ+ν–1) · I_(μ+ν–1)(2√(βa))
     ⁄ ( (√(βa))^(μ+ν–1) ),
see, for example, formulas in tables of integrals (the result is valid when the power‐factor makes the endpoints integrable and when μ + ν > 0).

In our problem we first “match” exponents. Writing the integrand in the form
  x^(–1/4)(4–x)^(–3/4)
we note that if we choose
  μ – 1 = –1/4 → μ = 3/4  and  ν – 1 = –3/4 → ν = 1/4,
then μ + ν = 3/4 + 1/4 = 1. (In many such integrals one finds a symmetry between the two factors.) Also we take a = 4.

Next, take β = 1. Then the cosh–term is
  cosh (2√(x(4 – x))).
With these choices our formula tells us that
  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–1/4)(4–x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4–x))) dx
    = Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) ·4^( (3/4+1/4)–1) · I_(3/4+1/4–1)(2√(4))
      ⁄ ( (√(4))^(3/4+1/4–1) ).
Since (3/4 + 1/4) – 1 = 0 the powers of 4 (and of √4) drop out. Also note that I₀(2√(4)) = I₀(4). Thus we obtain
  I = Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) · I₀(4).

But it is a classical fact that
  Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) = π√2.
(There are several proofs of this classic formula.) Hence we finally deduce
  I = π√2 · I₀(4).

Step 2. A numerical evaluation

The modified Bessel function I₀ at 4 is known (or may be computed) to high accuracy. One finds, for example,
  I₀(4) ≈ 11.3019219502.
Multiplying by π√2 (with π√2 ≈ 4.4428829382) we get
  I ≈ 4.4428829382 × 11.3019219502 ≈ 50.2050000000.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = π√2 · I₀(4)  ≈ 50.2050000000.
