We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–1/4) (4 – x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4 – x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of the modified Bessel function I₀. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.)

One standard way to attack an integral of the form

  ∫₀ᵃ x^(μ–1) (a – x)^(ν–1) cosh (2√{λ x(a–x)}) dx

is to expand the hyperbolic cosine in its Taylor series and then exchange sum and integration. (In our case the endpoints are “singular” but the singularities are integrable.) In our problem one may identify

  a = 4, μ – 1 = –1/4 ⟹ μ = 3/4,
  and ν – 1 = –3/4 ⟹ ν = 1/4,
  and the cosh‐term is cosh(2√{x(4–x)}) (so that here λ = 1).

Indeed, writing
  cosh(2√{x(4–x)}) = Σₘ₌₀∞ [2√{x(4–x)}]^(2m)/(2m)! = Σₘ₌₀∞ 4^m [x(4–x)]^m/(2m)!,
we have
  I = Σₘ₌₀∞ 4^m/(2m)! ∫₀⁴ x^(m – 1/4)(4 – x)^(m – 3/4) dx.

Changing the variable by writing x = 4z (so that dx = 4dz and the Beta–integrals appear) one obtains
  ∫₀⁴ x^(m – 1/4)(4 – x)^(m – 3/4) dx = 4^(2m–1) B(m + 3/4, m + 1/4),
with B(3/4, 1/4) = Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4) = π√2 (a classical formula). Thus one obtains a series

  I = π√2 Σₘ₌₀∞ [4^(3m–1)] (Γ(m+3/4)Γ(m+1/4))/( (2m)! Γ(2m+1) ).

One may show (using the standard representation of I₀ as a series)
  I₀(4) = Σₘ₌₀∞ (4^(2m))/( (m!)²),
so that after a little work one may “collect” all constants to show that

  I = π√2 I₀(4) .

For example, an alternate method is to make the substitution

  x = 4 sin²θ  (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2)
so that one eventually obtains an integral representation which can be recognized (after a change to the variable φ = 2θ) as one of the standard representations of the modified Bessel function I₀.

A short summary is: One acceptable answer is

  ∫₀⁴ x^(–1/4)(4–x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√{x(4–x)}) dx = π√2 I₀(4).

A numerical evaluation (using, say,  I₀(4) ≈ 11.30192195) gives

  I ≈ π√2 × 11.30192195 ≈ 50.2127123180.
