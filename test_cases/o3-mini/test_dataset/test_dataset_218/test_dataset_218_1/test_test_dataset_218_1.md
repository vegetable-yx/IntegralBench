We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [ln²x / √(4 – x²)] dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = – (π/6)·ln²2 – (ln2/2)·(Li₂(e^(–iπ/3)) – Li₂(e^(iπ/3)))
    + (1/8)·(Li₃(e^(–2iπ/3)) + Li₃(e^(2iπ/3))).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer of that type.

Step 1. (A change of variable)

A good substitution is
  x = 2 sinθ, dx = 2 cosθ dθ,
and note that
  √(4 – x²) = √(4 – 4 sin²θ) = 2 cosθ.
When x runs from 0 to 1, we have θ going from 0 to arcsin(1/2) = π/6. Hence
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) {ln²(2 sinθ) / [2 cosθ]}·(2 cosθ dθ)
     = ∫₀^(π/6) ln²(2 sinθ) dθ.

Step 2. (Splitting the logarithm)

Write
  ln(2 sinθ) = ln2 + ln(sinθ).
Then
  ln²(2 sinθ) = ln²2 + 2 ln2·ln(sinθ) + ln²(sinθ).
Thus we may write
  I = (π/6)·ln²2 + 2 ln2·J₁ + J₂,
with
  J₁ = ∫₀^(π/6) ln(sinθ)dθ and J₂ = ∫₀^(π/6) ln²(sinθ)dθ.

Both J₁ and J₂ have been studied in the literature and (after some work using for example a Fourier‐series expansion for ln(sinθ) or by differentiating a parameter–dependent integral) one may show that the answer can be written in closed form in terms of dilogarithms and trilogarithms.

Step 3. (The final answer)

One acceptable answer is to show that
  I = – (π/6)·ln²2 – (ln2/2)·(Li₂(e^(–iπ/3)) – Li₂(e^(iπ/3)))
    + (1/8)·(Li₃(e^(–2iπ/3)) + Li₃(e^(2iπ/3))).
A short calculation (or help from a computer‐algebra system) shows that numerically 
  I ≈ 0.3103833000.

Step 4. (Conclusion)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = – (π/6) ln²2 – (ln2/2)[Li₂(e^(–iπ/3)) – Li₂(e^(iπ/3))]
    + (1/8)[Li₃(e^(–2iπ/3)) + Li₃(e^(2iπ/3))] ≈ 0.3103833000.
