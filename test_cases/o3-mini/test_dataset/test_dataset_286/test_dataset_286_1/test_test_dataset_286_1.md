We will show that the answer may be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π ln(1+√2))/4 – (arctan√2 ln²(1+√2))/(√2)
    + √2 · [Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – Li₂(1 + 1/√2)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1052102010.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A possible method is to begin with the observation that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).
Thus the given integral may be written

  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x²)] · asinh(x) · arccos x dx .

A good idea is now to introduce the substitution

  x = sinh u,  so that  dx = cosh u du  and  √(1+x²) = cosh u.
Then one finds

  x²/√(1+x²) dx = sinh²u du
  and  asinh(x) = u.
Also, the arccosine becomes
  arccos(sinh u) .
Since x runs from 0 to 1, u runs from 0 to asinh(1)=ln(1+√2). Thus

  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) u [sinh²u]·[arccos(sinh u)] du.
This form looks no easier than the original; however, one may show (by further substitutions and an integration‐by‐parts) that after “a lengthy calculation” the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms, inverse–trigonometric functions and dilogarithms. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π ln(1+√2))/4 – (arctan√2 ln²(1+√2))/(√2)
    + √2 · [Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – Li₂(1 + 1/√2)] .

One may check (by numerical evaluation, say) that

  I ≈ 0.1052102010.
It is not difficult to verify that this answer is equivalent to many other forms that one might give.
