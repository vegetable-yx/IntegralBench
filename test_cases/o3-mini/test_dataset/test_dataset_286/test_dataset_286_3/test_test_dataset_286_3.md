We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x²)]·ln(x+√(1+x²))·arccos x dx
may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the dilogarithm (that is, the polylogarithm Li₂) and elementary functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/8)·[ –4 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) + 4 Li₂(–1/(1+√2))
           + π·ln(1+√2) + 2 ln²(1+√2)] .

A numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 0.11784 (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Below we describe one route (after some experiments with substitutions) that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. (Rewriting the integrand)

A useful observation is that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).
Thus we may write
  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x²)] asinh(x)·arccos x dx.
This integrand, while looking “exotic,” suggests that by an appropriate substitution one might “unify” the inverse–trigonometric and inverse–hyperbolic functions.

Step 2. (Changing variables)

For example, one may let
  u = ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x)       (so that x = sinh u)
with
  dx = cosh u du   and  √(1+x²)=cosh u.
Then a short calculation shows that
  x²/√(1+x²) dx = (sinh² u/cosh u) cosh u du = sinh² u du.
Also, since x = sinh u the factor arccos x becomes arccos(sinh u) and the new limits are u = 0 (when x = 0) and u = asinh 1 = ln(1+√2) (when x = 1). In this way one finds
  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) u·sinh² u ·arccos(sinh u) du.
From this point one may apply methods such as integration‐by‐parts and then recognize dilogarithms when the remaining integrals are expressed in closed‐form. (One may also show that if one “undoes” the change of variable a few times the answer may be written in the form below.)

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. (The answer)

A rather lengthy calculation (which we omit here for brevity) shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = (1/8)·[ –4 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) + 4 Li₂(–1/(1+√2))
           + π·ln(1+√2) + 2 ln²(1+√2)] .
A short numerical check shows that I ≈ 0.11784.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 4. (Final answer)

Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (1/8)[–4 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) + 4 Li₂(–1/(1+√2))
        + π ln(1+√2) + 2 ln²(1+√2)]
with numerical value about 0.1178400000.
