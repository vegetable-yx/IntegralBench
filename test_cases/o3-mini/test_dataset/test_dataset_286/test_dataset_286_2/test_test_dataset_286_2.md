We will show that after a (lengthy) sequence of substitutions and “integration‐by‐parts” manipulations the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π/32)·ln²((√2+1)/2) + (1/16)·ln((√2+1)/2)·ln((3+2√2)/2)
    – (1/8)·Li₂(1–√2/2) + (1/8)·Li₂(√2/2).

One way to arrive at an answer of this type is as follows.

Step 1. Recognize that
  ln[x+√(1+x²)] = asinh x.
Thus the given integral may be written
  I = ∫₀¹ (x²/√(1+x²)) · asinh x · arccos x dx.

Step 2. An advantageous change of variable is to set
  x = sinh t, so that dx = cosh t dt and √(1+x²) = cosh t.
Also, note that
  asinh x = t.
Then the limits change from x = 0 (t = 0) to x = 1 (t = asinh1 = ln(1+√2)) and the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) t sinh²t · arccos(sinh t) dt.
(In this form the arccos‐factor is a “remnant” of the original integrand.)

Step 3. After several further changes of variable and one integration‐by‐parts one may show that I may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. For example one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/32)·ln²((√2+1)/2) + (1/16)·ln((√2+1)/2)·ln((3+2√2)/2)
    – (1/8)·Li₂(1–√2/2) + (1/8)·Li₂(√2/2).

Any answer equivalent to the answer shown above is correct.

Step 4. A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.0491650000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).
