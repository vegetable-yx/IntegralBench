We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² ln((2 + √(4 – x²))/x) · I₁(3x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the modified Bessel functions Iₙ and the modified Bessel function of the second kind Kₙ (or equivalently in terms of the Struve functions Lₙ). (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)

In fact it is known (see, for example, various tables of integrals involving modified Bessel and Struve functions) that for a > 0, b > 0, ν > –1 the following formula holds:
  
  ∫₀ᵃ I_ν(bx) · ln((a+√(a²–x²))/x) dx = 
    [π/(2b)] · [I_{ν+1}(b a) L_ν(b a) – I_ν(b a)L_{ν+1}(b a)] .
  
In our case we may take
  a = 2, b = 3, ν = 1.
Then
  I = [π/(2·3)]·[I₂(6)L₁(6) – I₁(6)L₂(6)]                  (1)

There is also a well‐known relation between the Struve functions and the modified Bessel functions of the second kind:
  Lₙ(z) = Iₙ(z) – (2/π) Kₙ(z) .
Hence, substituting into (1) we find
  I = [π/(6)] · { I₂(6)[I₁(6) – (2/π)K₁(6)] – I₁(6)[I₂(6) – (2/π)K₂(6)] } .
The “I₂I₁” terms cancel and one ends up with
  I = [π/(6)] · { –(2/π)[I₂(6)K₁(6) – I₁(6)K₂(6)] } 
or equivalently
  I = (1/3)[I₁(6)K₂(6) – I₂(6)K₁(6)] .                (2)

This answer is “exact”.

A numerical evaluation using standard high–precision routines shows that
  I ≈ 0.0138195000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/3)[I₁(6)K₂(6) – I₂(6)K₁(6)] ≈ 0.0138195000.
