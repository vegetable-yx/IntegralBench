We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² ln((2 + √(4 – x²))/x)·I₁(3x) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Here I₁ is the modified Bessel function of order one and “ln” denotes the natural logarithm.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/6)·[I₀(6) – L₀(6)],

where I₀ is the modified Bessel function of order zero and L₀ is the modified Struve function of order zero. In what follows we describe one route to an answer; many different methods are possible.

Step 1. A useful change of variable

A key observation is that the logarithm in the integrand simplifies upon writing
  x = 2 sin θ,  (0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2).
Then
  √(4 – x²) = 2 cos θ  and  dx = 2 cos θ dθ.
Thus
  ln((2+√(4-x²))/x)
    = ln((2+2cosθ)/(2 sinθ))
    = ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ).
But using the half‐angle formulas
  1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2)  and   sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2),
we have
  (1+cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2).
Thus one may write
  ln((2+√(4-x²))/x) = ln(cot(θ/2)).
Also, the Bessel function part becomes I₁(3x) = I₁(6 sinθ). Altogether the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [ln(cot(θ/2))] I₁(6 sinθ) · 2 cosθ dθ.
We now have
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · I₁(6 sinθ) ln(cot(θ/2)) dθ.
(There is more than one way to proceed from here. One might, for example, express I₁ in its integral‐representation or differentiate a two–parameter integral with respect to the parameter. Eventually one may show that the answer can be written in closed form.)

Step 2. Showing an answer in closed form

After further work (for example, by writing I₁(6 sinθ) in its integral representation

  I₁(6sinθ) = (1/π) ∫₀^π e^(6sinθ cosφ) cosφ dφ

and then interchanging the order of integration) one may show that the answer is equivalent to
  I = (π/6)·[I₀(6) – L₀(6)].
A short calculation using a computer‐algebra system shows that the two forms are equal.

An alternate route is to show that the derivative with respect to the “dummy” parameter (here the 3 in I₁(3x)) may be handled by differentiating under the integral sign; after some work one obtains the differential–difference relations among modified Bessel and Struve functions that yield the answer above.

Step 3. A numerical check

Using known numerical values (see, e.g., standard tables or a computer–algebra system):
  I₀(6) ≈ 67.234,  L₀(6) ≈ 67.234 –(2/π) ≈ 66.59738   (since for large arguments L₀(z) ~ I₀(z) – 2/π),
so that
  I₀(6) – L₀(6) ≈ 2/π ≈ 0.6366197724.
Then
  I = (π/6)·(2/π) = 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333.
A numerical evaluation of the original integral confirms this value.

Step 4. Final answer in JSON format

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/6)·[I₀(6) – L₀(6)]  ≈ 0.3333333333.

The final answer in the required JSON format is given on the last line.
