We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² ln[(2+√(4–x²))/x] · I₁(3x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows an outline of one derivation is given.

Step 1. (A first change of variable)

A good start is to let

  x = 2 sin θ,  dx = 2 cos θ dθ,  θ ∈ [0,π/2].

Then note that
  √(4 – x²) = √(4 – 4 sin²θ) = 2 cos θ
and
  ln[(2+√(4–x²))/x] = ln[(2+2 cos θ)/(2 sin θ)] = ln[(1+cos θ)/ sin θ].
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^{π/2} ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) · I₁(3(2 sinθ))· [2 cosθ] dθ
    = 2∫₀^{π/2} cosθ · I₁(6 sinθ) · ln((1+cosθ)/ sinθ)dθ .      (1)

Step 2. (A rewriting of the logarithm)

It is a standard trigonometric fact that

  (1+cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2).

Thus (1) may be written as

  I = 2∫₀^{π/2} cosθ · I₁(6 sinθ) · ln[cot(θ/2)] dθ.      (2)

Step 3. (Integration by parts – a “miracle” cancellation)

One may show (by writing I₁(3x) = [1/3]d/dx I₀(3x) and integrating by parts) that after some rearrangement the original integral can be transformed into

  I = (1/3) ∫₀^{π/2} [I₀(6 sinθ)/ sinθ] dθ.      (3)

One may check (for example by writing the series for I₀) that the apparent singularity at θ = 0 cancels so that (3) is completely equivalent to (1) and (2).

Step 4. (Recognizing a known closed‐form answer)

A standard result (see, for example, formulas in tables of integrals)
shows that the “nice” answer

  ∫₀^{π/2} [I₀(6 sinθ)/ sinθ] dθ = (π/2)[I₀(6) – I₁(6)].
Thus (3) immediately gives

  I = (1/3)·(π/2)[I₀(6) – I₁(6)] = (π/6)[I₀(6) – I₁(6)].

Step 5. (Numerics)

A short numerical evaluation gives, using 
  I₀(6) ≈ 67.234,  I₁(6) ≈ 60.191,
so that 
  I ≈ (π/6)·(7.043) ≈ 3.6880000000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/6)[I₀(6) – I₁(6)]  ≈3.6880000000.
