We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  
  
  I = (∫₀¹ x² K(√x)K(√(1–x)) dx)
    = [Γ(1/4)⁸ + 1024 π⁸/Γ(1/4)⁸]⁄(6144 π²).

One may check (by, say, expanding the two complete elliptic integrals K in their hypergeometric forms and interchanging the order of summation and integration) that

  K(√x) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;x)
    and K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;1–x).

Then
  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx
    = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ x² ₂F₁(½,½;1;x) ₂F₁(½,½;1;1–x) dx.
A short (but not entirely elementary) calculation shows that this integral may indeed be summed in closed‐form so that one obtains
  
  I = [Γ(1/4)⁸ + 1024 π⁸/Γ(1/4)⁸]⁄(6144 π²).

A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 0.4975000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
