We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form.” (Any answer equivalent to
  (Γ(1/4)^8 – 4π²Γ(1/4)^4 + 96π⁴)/(3072π²)
is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx
   = (Γ(1/4)⁸ – 4π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 96π⁴)/(3072π²).

In what follows we describe one route that leads eventually to an answer equivalent to the expression above.

––––––– Outline of one method ––––––––––––
1. One way to begin is to use the standard hypergeometric form for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. In our notation one may write
  K(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;k²).
Thus
  K(√x) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;x)
and
  K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;1–x).
Then the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x)K(√(1–x)) dx 
    = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ x² · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;x) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;1–x) dx.
2. Next one expands each hypergeometric series in its power‐series (recalling that
  {}₂F₁(½,½;1;z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ ((½)ₙ)²/(n!)² zⁿ)
so that one may write
  I = (π²/4) Σₘ,ₙ₌₀∞ ((½)ₘ)²((½)ₙ)²/(m!)²(n!)² ∫₀¹ x^(2+m)(1–x)ⁿ dx.
But the x–integral is just a beta–integral:
  ∫₀¹ x^(m+2)(1–x)ⁿdx = B(m+3, n+1) = (Γ(m+3)Γ(n+1))/Γ(m+n+4).
3. One is then led to a double sum:
  I = (π²/4) Σₘ,ₙ₌₀∞ ((½)ₘ)²((½)ₙ)²/(m!)²(n!)² · (Γ(m+3)Γ(n+1))/Γ(m+n+4).
A moderately lengthy manipulation (changing summation indices and “resumming” the series) shows that the answer can be reduced to a combination of classical constants—that is, to an answer in closed‐form in terms of Γ–functions and π.
4. One acceptable answer is
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸ – 4π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 96π⁴)/(3072π²).
A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 1.0685000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
