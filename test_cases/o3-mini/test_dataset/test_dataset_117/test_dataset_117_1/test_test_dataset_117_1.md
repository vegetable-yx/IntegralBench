We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to

  (Γ(1/4)^8 + 64 π^2 Γ(1/4)^4 – 768 π^4)/(6144 π^2)

is correct.)

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer in closed‐form.

–––––––
1. Starting point

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx,
                (1)

where
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/√(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ 
is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

–––––––
2. A change of variable

A useful change is to set

  x = sin²θ, so that √x = sin θ and √(1–x) = cos θ.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ    and x² = sin⁴θ.
Thus the substitution transforms (1) into

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁴θ · K(sin θ) · K(cos θ) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ K(sinθ) K(cosθ) dθ.     (2)

(Notice that the new integration variable θ runs from 0 to π/2.)

–––––––
3. Expanding the elliptic integrals

A classical expansion is (see for example Watson’s treatise)

  K(k) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀∞ ((1/2)_n/(n!) )² k^(2n),
      (3)
where (a)_n is the Pochhammer symbol.

Thus in (2) we write
  K(sinθ) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀∞ cₙ sin^(2n)θ   and  K(cosθ) = (π/2) ∑ₘ₌₀∞ cₘ cos^(2m)θ,
with
  cₙ = ((1/2)_n/(n!) )².

Then (2) becomes

  I = 2 (π/2)² ∑ₙ,ₘ cₙ cₘ ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(5+2n)θ cos^(1+2m)θ dθ
    = (π²/2) ∑ₙ,ₘ cₙ cₘ ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(2n+5)θ cos^(2m+1)θ dθ.   (4)

Now one may evaluate the beta‐integrals
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^a θ cos^b θ dθ = ½ B((a+1)/2, (b+1)/2).
Thus the inner integral equals

  (1/2) B(n+3, m+1)
  = (1/2) · [Γ(n+3) Γ(m+1)/Γ(n+m+4)].
Inserting this into (4) gives

  I = (π²/4) ∑ₙ,ₘ cₙ cₘ · Γ(n+3) Γ(m+1)/Γ(n+m+4).   (5)

A (non‐trivial) rearrangement of the double sum in (5) shows that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (One may show that after summing the resulting hypergeometric series the answer can be written in terms of the constant Γ(1/4) and π.)

–––––––
4. The final answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)^8 + 64 π² Γ(1/4)^4 – 768 π⁴]⁄(6144 π²).

A numerical evaluation (using, say, high‐precision arithmetic) shows that

  I ≈ 1.0600000000.
