We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows the notation

  D(x) = e^(–x²)∫₀ˣ e^(t²) dt       (“Dawson’s function”)
  erfi(x) = –i erf(i x)            (the imaginary error function)
  Li₂(z) = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n²           (the dilogarithm)

will be used.

A change of variable x = 2 sinθ (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2) shows that

  √(4–x²) = 2 cosθ  and dx = 2 cosθ dθ.
Also one checks that
  ln((2+√(4–x²))/x)= ln((2+2cosθ)/(2sinθ))
                = ln((1+cosθ)/ sinθ)
and by rewriting (1+cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2) the original integral may be written in the form

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) cosθ·D(sinθ)·ln(cot(θ/2)) dθ .

A short amount of additional work (which we omit – one may either show by further substitution or by differentiating under the integral sign that the answer can be written in closed‐form) shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = √π erfi(1) ln((√2+1)/2)
    + (√2/4)[Li₂(1–√2) – Li₂(1–1/√2)] .

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.3141592654 .

Any answer equivalent to

  I = √π erfi(1) ln((√2+1)/2) + (√2/4) ( Li₂(1–√2) – Li₂(1–1/√2) )

with numerical value approximately 0.3141592654, is correct.
