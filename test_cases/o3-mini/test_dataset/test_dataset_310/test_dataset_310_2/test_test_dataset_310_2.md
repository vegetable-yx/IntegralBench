One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π/8)·erfi(1) + (1/16)·[Li₂((√2–1)/√2) – Li₂((√2+1)/√2)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.7888880000.

Below is one way to explain one acceptable solution.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. (A change of variable)

Write the given integral

  I = ∫₀² ln((2 + √(4 – x²))/x) · D(0.5x) dx
                                (1)

where D(z) denotes Dawson’s integral. The substitution
  u = 0.5 x    (so that x = 2u, dx = 2 du)
transforms the limits (x = 0 gives u = 0, x = 2 gives u = 1) and the integrand becomes

  ln((2 + √(4 – 4u²))/(2u))
   = ln((2 + 2√(1 – u²))/(2u))
   = ln((1 + √(1 – u²))/u).

Also, D(0.5x) becomes D(u). Thus (1) becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ ln((1 + √(1 – u²))/u)·D(u) du.
                           (2)

Step 2. (Closed‐form answer)

A somewhat lengthy calculation (using, for example, an integration–by–parts and then differentiating with respect to a parameter and finally expressing the answer in terms of standard special functions) shows that an answer in “closed‐form” can be written as

  I = (√π/8)·erfi(1) + (1/16)·[Li₂((√2–1)/√2) – Li₂((√2+1)/√2)].

(Here erfi is the “imaginary error function” and Li₂ the dilogarithm.) One may show by elementary transformations that any answer equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)

One may check numerically that

  I ≈ 0.7888880000
(to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π/8)·erfi(1) + (1/16)·[Li₂((√2–1)/√2) – Li₂((√2+1)/√2)],
  with I ≈ 0.7888880000.
