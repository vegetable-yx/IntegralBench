We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the gamma–function. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)¹⁶ + 192π²Γ(1/4)⁸ + 1024π⁴)⁄(2688√2 π² Γ(1/4)⁸).

In other words,
  
    I = [Γ(1/4)^(16) + 192π² Γ(1/4)^(8) + 1024π⁴]⁄[2688√2 π² Γ(1/4)^(8)].

One may show that a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.8466296103.

Below we describe one route to arrive at an answer such as the one above.

────────────────────────────
Outline of one solution method:

1. Begin with the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx,
where
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/√(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ   and  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.
A good first step is to “remove the square‐roots” from the arguments by the change of variable
  u = √x  ⇒  x = u²,  dx = 2u du.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ (u²)² K(u) E(√(1–u²)) · 2u du
    = 2∫₀¹ u⁵ K(u) E(√(1–u²)) du.

2. Next one may make the substitution u = sinθ so that u⁵ = sin⁵θ and √(1–u²) = cosθ. Then one finds
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ K(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ.
At this point one has “expressed the integrals” in a form where one may use known series expansions for K and E 
(or representations in terms of hypergeometric functions) to reduce the double‐integral to a double series which may be summed in closed–form.

3. After some (rather lengthy) manipulations – for example writing
  K(k) = (π/2) {}₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)
and
  E(k) = (π/2) {}₂F₁(–½,½;1;k²),
interchanging summation and integration and using a Beta–integral, one may show that I can be written in closed–form in terms of gamma–functions. (There is more than one way to do the details; many authors have studied integrals of products of complete elliptic integrals.)

4. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)^(16) + 192π² Γ(1/4)^(8) + 1024π⁴)⁄(2688√2 π² Γ(1/4)^(8)).
A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.8466296103.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is:

  {"answer": "\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})^{16}+192\\pi^2\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})^8+1024\\pi^4}{2688\\sqrt{2}\\pi^2\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})^8}", "numerical_answer": "0.8466296103"}
