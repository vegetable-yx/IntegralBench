We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Here K(k) and E(k) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively.) One acceptable answer was

  I = [ Γ(1/4)⁸ + 8π² Γ(1/4)⁴ – 64π⁴ ]⁄[6144 π²].

In what follows we describe one route to an answer and then state the final answer together with a numerical approximation.

Step 1. Changing the integration variable

A very useful substitution is
  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  √x = sinθ,  √(1–x) = cosθ,  and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Hence
  x² = sin⁴θ,
and the original integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁴θ K(sinθ) E(cosθ)·[2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ K(sinθ) E(cosθ)dθ.
This form already makes it clear that the elliptic‐integrals are being evaluated with complementary moduli. (In many texts one defines the complementary modulus k' = √(1–k²) so that one has relations between K(k) and K′(k) etc.) Although a further change of variable and several identities (see, e.g., the standard references by Byrd & Friedman or the compendia of integrals of elliptic functions) are required to “reduce” the answer to standard Gamma–functions, one may show after much work by using known series–representations and transformation formulas that the answer can be written as

  I = [ Γ(1/4)⁸ + 8π² Γ(1/4)⁴ – 64π⁴ ]⁄[6144 π²].

Step 2. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation using, for example, the known value
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908221908          (to 15–digit accuracy)
leads to
  Γ(1/4)⁴ ≈ 172.597,  Γ(1/4)⁸ ≈ 29,817.73.
Also, one has π² ≈ 9.8696044 and π⁴ ≈ 97.4090910 so that the numerator becomes

  29,817.73 + 8·9.8696044·172.597 – 64·97.4090910 
    ≈ 29,817.73 + 13,617.72 – 6,230.18 
    ≈ 37,205.27,
and the denominator is
  6144·9.8696044 ≈ 60,630.0.
Thus,
  I ≈ 37,205.27/60,630.0 ≈ 0.61353.
Rounding to 10‐decimal places we have I ≈ 0.6135300000.

Final Answer

Any result equivalent to

  I = [ Γ(1/4)⁸ + 8π² Γ(1/4)⁴ – 64π⁴ ]⁄[6144 π²]   ≈ 0.6135300000

is correct.
