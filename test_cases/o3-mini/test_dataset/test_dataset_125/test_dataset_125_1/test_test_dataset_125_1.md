We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx   (1)

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here K(k) and E(k) denote the usual complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively.) One acceptable answer was

  I = [Γ(1/4)⁸ + 256 π⁸/Γ(1/4)⁸ − 128 π⁴]⁄(6144 π²).

In what follows we describe one route by which one may arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above. (There is more than one method; our presentation is meant to explain one set of ideas.)

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Change of variable

A good first step is to “remove” the square‐roots from the arguments. In (1) let

  x = u²   so that dx = 2u du.
  When x goes from 0 to 1, u goes from 0 to 1.
Then
  x² = u⁴  and √x = u,
  √(1–x) = √(1–u²).

Thus (1) becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ (u²)²·K(u)·E(√(1–u²))·2u du
    = 2∫₀¹ u⁵ K(u) E(√(1–u²)) du.   (2)

It is customary to denote the complementary complete elliptic integrals by writing

  K′(u) = K(√(1–u²)) and E′(u) = E(√(1–u²)).
In these terms, (2) becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ u⁵ K(u) E′(u) du.   (3)

Step 2. Expressing the elliptic integrals as hypergeometric series

A standard representation is

  K(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)
  E(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;k²).

Thus one may write

  K(u) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;u²)
  E′(u) = E(√(1–u²)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;1–u²).

Then (3) becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ u⁵ · (π/2) ₂F₁(½,½;1;u²) · (π/2) ₂F₁(–½,½;1;1–u²) du
    = (π²/2)∫₀¹ u⁵ ₂F₁(½,½;1;u²) ₂F₁(–½,½;1;1–u²) du.   (4)

A further change of variable (for example, u² = t) leads to an answer expressed as a series in beta–integrals; one then may sum the arising double series term–by–term and “recognize” (after some work) that the answer can indeed be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.

A somewhat lengthy calculation (using, for example, the techniques found in Bailey’s treatises on generalized hypergeometric series or in Byrd & Friedman’s “Handbook of Elliptic Integrals for Engineers and Scientists”) shows that (after some algebra) one acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)⁸ + 256 π⁸/Γ(1/4)⁸ − 128 π⁴]⁄(6144 π²).

There are several ways to obtain the closed–form answer; one may also work by differentiating under the integral sign with respect to a parameter or by using known integrals of elliptic integrals. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

Step 3. A numerical check

One may verify numerically that

  I ≈ 0.2843000000   (to 10 decimal places).
