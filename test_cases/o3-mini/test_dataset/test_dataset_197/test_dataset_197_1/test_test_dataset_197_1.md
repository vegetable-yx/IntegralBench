We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·arcsin(x)·arccos(x) dx.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand using a known trigonometric identity. For x ∈ [0, 1] one has

  arcsin x + arccos x = π/2  ⇒  arccos x = π/2 − arcsin x.

Thus,
  arcsin x·arccos x = arcsin x·(π/2 − arcsin x) = (π/2)·arcsin x − (arcsin x)².
Then the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ x [ (π/2) · arcsin x − (arcsin x)² ] dx.

Step 2. Perform the substitution
  t = arcsin x  ⇒  x = sin t   and  dx = cos t dt.
When x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to π/2.
Thus, the integral transforms into
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sin t) [ (π/2) t − t² ] (cos t dt)
     = ∫₀^(π/2) sin t cos t [ (π/2) t − t² ] dt.

Step 3. Use the double-angle formula for sine. Since
  sin t cos t = ½ sin 2t,
we can write
  I = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) sin 2t [ (π/2) t − t² ] dt.
Separate this into two integrals:
  I = (π/4) ∫₀^(π/2) t sin 2t dt − ½ ∫₀^(π/2) t² sin 2t dt.
Let
  J₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) t sin 2t dt  and  J₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) t² sin 2t dt.
Thus,
  I = (π/4) J₁ − (1/2) J₂.

Step 4. Evaluate J₁.
Using integration by parts:
 Let u = t  ⇒ du = dt,
   dv = sin 2t dt  ⇒ v = −(cos 2t)/2.
Then,
  J₁ = [−t cos 2t/2]₀^(π/2) + ∫₀^(π/2) (cos 2t)/2 dt.
At t = π/2, cos(π) = −1 so:
  −( (π/2)(−1) )/2 = π/4,
and at t = 0 the term is 0. Also,
  ∫₀^(π/2) cos 2t dt = (sin 2t/2)₀^(π/2) = (sin π − sin 0)/2 = 0.
Thus,
  J₁ = π/4.

Step 5. Evaluate J₂.
Again use integration by parts:
 Let u = t²  ⇒ du = 2t dt,
   dv = sin 2t dt  ⇒ v = −(cos 2t)/2.
Then,
  J₂ = [−t² cos 2t/2]₀^(π/2) + ∫₀^(π/2) t cos 2t dt.
At t = π/2: t² = (π/2)² = π²/4 and cos(π)= −1, so the boundary term becomes
  − ( (π²/4)(−1) )/2 = π²/8.
Call the remaining integral I₂:
  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) t cos 2t dt.
Now evaluate I₂ by integration by parts:
 Let u = t  ⇒ du = dt,
   dv = cos 2t dt  ⇒ v = sin 2t/2.
Thus,
  I₂ = [t sin 2t/2]₀^(π/2) − ∫₀^(π/2) (sin 2t/2) dt.
At t = π/2, sin π = 0 so the boundary term vanishes and
  I₂ = − (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin 2t dt.
Compute the sine integral:
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin 2t dt = [−cos 2t/2]₀^(π/2) = [ (−cos π + cos 0) ]/2 = ( (1+1) )/2 = 1.
Thus, I₂ = −1/2.
Therefore,
  J₂ = π²/8 + I₂ = π²/8 − 1/2.

Step 6. Substitute J₁ and J₂ back into I:
 I = (π/4)·(π/4) − (1/2)·(π²/8 − 1/2)
   = π²/16 − (π²/16 − 1/4)
   = 1/4.

Thus the exact answer is 1/4.

Step 7. Provide a numerical approximation:
 1/4 = 0.25, and written to 10 decimal places: 0.2500000000.
