We wish to find an antiderivative F(x) so that

  F′(x) = sin(101x)·[sin(x)]^(99).

A very useful idea is to “split” sin(101x) using the angle‐addition formula. In fact, note that

  sin(101x) = sin(100x + x) = sin(100x)cos(x) + cos(100x)sin(x).

Then
  sin(101x)·[sin(x)]^(99)
     = sin(100x)cos(x)[sin(x)]^(99) + cos(100x)sin(x)[sin(x)]^(99)
     = sin(100x)cos(x)[sin(x)]^(99) + cos(100x)[sin(x)]^(100).

Now observe that the derivative of [sin(x)]^(100) is

  d/dx [sin(x)]^(100) = 100 [sin(x)]^(99) cos(x).

That is, we have
  [sin(x)]^(99) cos(x) = (1/100)·d/dx [sin(x)]^(100).

Thus the integrand rewrites as

  (1/100) sin(100x)· d/dx [sin(x)]^(100) + cos(100x)[sin(x)]^(100).

Now, notice that the derivative of the product
  u(x) = sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(100)
can be computed using the product rule:
  u′(x) = 100 cos(100x)[sin(x)]^(100) + sin(100x)·100[sin(x)]^(99)cos(x)
      = 100 { cos(100x)[sin(x)]^(100) + sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(99)cos(x) }.

That shows
  u′(x) = 100 · {cos(100x)[sin(x)]^(100) + sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(99)cos(x)}
which is exactly 100 times our integrand. In other words,
  d/dx [sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(100)] = 100 sin(101x)[sin(x)]^(99).

Thus an antiderivative is given by

  F(x) = (1/100) sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(100) + C.

We now summarize our result:

Exact Answer:
  ∫ sin(101x)[sin(x)]^(99) dx = (sin(100x)[sin(x)]^(100))/100 + C.

For the numerical approximation we must “pin down” x. (Since an antiderivative is defined up to an arbitrary constant, one must select a specific value. Here we choose x = 1 as a sample evaluation.) Then

  F(1) = (sin(100)*[sin(1)]^(100))/100.

Let us compute:
  • sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848, so [sin(1)]^(100) ≈ exp(100·ln(0.8414709848)).
    ln(0.8414709848) ≈ –0.172476, so 100·ln(0.8414709848) ≈ –17.2476,
    and hence [sin(1)]^(100) ≈ exp(–17.2476) ≈ 3.23×10⁻⁸.
  • sin(100) (with 100 in radians) ≈ –0.5155 (this value may be found using a calculator).

Thus,
  F(1) ≈ (–0.5155 × 3.23×10⁻⁸) / 100 ≈ –1.663×10⁻¹⁰.

Rounded to 10 decimal places this is approximately –0.0000000002.

We now output the final result in the required JSON format:
