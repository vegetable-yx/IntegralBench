We will show that an antiderivative for

  I = ∫ sin(101x) · sin(x)^(99) dx

is given by

  F(x) = [sin(x)^(100) · sin(100x)]/100 + C.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand using the angle‐addition formula.
Note that
  sin(101x) = sin(100x + x) = sin(100x) cos x + cos(100x) sin x.
Then
  sin(101x) · sin(x)^(99)
     = sin(x)^(99)[sin(100x) cos x + cos(100x) sin x]
     = sin(100x) cos x · sin(x)^(99) + cos(100x) sin(x)^(100).

Step 2. Recognize the derivative of sin(x)^(100).
Differentiate sin(x)^(100):
  d/dx [sin(x)^(100)] = 100 sin(x)^(99) cos x.
Thus the first term in the integrand is (1/100) times the derivative of sin(x)^(100) multiplied by sin(100x).

Step 3. Consider the derivative of the product sin(x)^(100) sin(100x).
Differentiate
  F(x) = sin(x)^(100) sin(100x):
• Using the product rule,
  F'(x) = 100 sin(x)^(99) cos x · sin(100x) + sin(x)^(100) · [100 cos(100x)]
     = 100 sin(x)^(99)[cos x · sin(100x) + sin x · cos(100x)].
But by the sine addition formula we have
  cos x · sin(100x) + sin x · cos(100x) = sin(100x + x) = sin(101x).
Thus,
  F'(x) = 100 sin(x)^(99) sin(101x).

Step 4. Conclude the antiderivative.
Since
  d/dx [sin(x)^(100) sin(100x)] = 100 sin(x)^(99) sin(101x),
we deduce that
  ∫ sin(101x) sin(x)^(99) dx = [sin(x)^(100) sin(100x)]/100 + C.

Step 5. A Numerical Check
Although the result is an antiderivative (i.e. a function), we can illustrate its numerical size by evaluating it at a particular value. For example, take x = 1.
• sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848 so that sin(1)^(100) ≈ (0.8414709848)^(100). 
  Since ln(0.8414709848) ≈ -0.172, we have
   (0.8414709848)^(100) ≈ exp(100·(–0.172)) = exp(–17.2) ≈ 3.37×10^(–8).
• Next, sin(100) (100 is in radians) can be computed by reducing modulo 2π. One finds
  sin(100) ≈ –0.5063656411.
Thus, at x = 1 the antiderivative is approximately:
  F(1) ≈ (3.37×10^(–8) · (–0.5063656411))/100 ≈ –1.7070×10^(–10).
Rounded to 10 decimal places this is approximately –0.0000000002.
