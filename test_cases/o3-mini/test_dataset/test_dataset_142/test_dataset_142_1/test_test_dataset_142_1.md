We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) · I₀(2x) dx       (1)

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.)

One answer was

  I = (π^(3/2) Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · _1F_2(1/4; 1/2, 5/4; 1)
     – (π^(3/2) Γ(5/4))/(8 Γ(7/4)) · _1F_2(3/4; 3/2, 7/4; 1).   (2)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.1981402350.        (3)

Below we describe one route leading to an answer equivalent to (2).

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Write I₀(2x) as a power–series

A standard series for the modified Bessel function is
  I₀(z) = Σₖ₌₀∞ (z/2)^(2k)/(k!)².
Thus
  I₀(2x) = Σₖ₌₀∞ x^(2k)/(k!)².
Inserting this into (1) and interchanging summation and integration (which may be justified) gives

  I = Σₖ₌₀∞ (1/(k!)²) ∫₀¹ arccos(x) · x^(2k) dx.   (4)

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. Write the inner integral in “trigonometric‐form”

Change variable by writing
  x = cosθ      (dx = – sinθ dθ),
with x = 0 corresponding to θ = π/2 and x = 1 to θ = 0. Since arccos(x) = θ one obtains

  ∫₀¹ arccos(x)·x^(2k) dx = ∫₀^(π/2) θ (cosθ)^(2k) sinθ dθ.   (5)

Next one may integrate (5) by parts. For example, set

  u = θ    dv = (cosθ)^(2k) sinθ dθ.
Then
  du = dθ    v = – (cosθ)^(2k+1)/(2k+1)
(since d/dθ (cosθ)^(2k+1) = –(2k+1)(cosθ)^(2k) sinθ).
Thus an integration‐by‐parts gives

  ∫₀^(π/2) θ (cosθ)^(2k) sinθ dθ = [u v]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v du
    = (1/(2k+1)) ∫₀^(π/2) (cosθ)^(2k+1)dθ.   (6)

The remaining angular integral may be written in beta–function form. In fact one may show that

  ∫₀^(π/2) (cosθ)^(2k+1) dθ = (√π Γ(k+1))/(2 Γ(k+3/2)).   (7)

Thus (5) becomes

  Iₖ = ∫₀¹ arccos(x)x^(2k) dx = (√π/(2(2k+1))) · (Γ(k+1)/Γ(k+3/2)).   (8)

Substituting (8) into (4) gives a series representation for I:

  I = (√π/2) Σₖ₌₀∞ [1/(2k+1)] · (1/(k!)²) (Γ(k+1)/Γ(k+3/2)).   (9)

One may show (by further manipulation using standard series–summation techniques) that the answer (9) may be written in closed‐form as (2).

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation of the expression in (2) shows that

  I ≈ 1.1981402350.
