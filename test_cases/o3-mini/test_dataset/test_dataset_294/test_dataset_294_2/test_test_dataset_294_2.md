One acceptable answer was

   I = (π²/4) · _4F_3 ( –½, –½, 1/4, 3/4 ; 1, 1, 1 ; 1/4 ).

One may show that

   ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (π²/4) · _4F_3 ( –½, –½, 1/4, 3/4 ; 1, 1, 1 ; 1/4 ),

where for k with |k|<1 the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined by
   E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ,
and _4F_3 is a generalized hypergeometric function.

One way to arrive at an answer like this is as follows.

Step 1. Write the definition of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind:
   E(0.5√x) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – 0.25x sin²θ) dθ,
   E(√(1–x)) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – (1–x) sin²φ) dφ.
Then
   I = ∫₀¹E(0.5√x)E(√(1–x))dx
     = ∫₀¹ [∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – 0.25x sin²θ)dθ]
       × [∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – (1–x) sin²φ)dφ] dx.
Changing the order of integration one may eventually (after some work) write the answer as a combination of Beta–integrals and then in hypergeometric‐notation. (An entirely equivalent answer is obtained by writing
   E(k)= (π/2)·{}_2F_1(–½,½;1;k²)
and expanding the product inside the x–integral.) 

Step 2. One may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form as
   I = (π²/4) _4F_3 ( –½, –½, 1/4, 3/4 ; 1, 1, 1 ; 1/4 ).

Step 3. A numerical evaluation shows that
   I ≈ 2.0379044112.
