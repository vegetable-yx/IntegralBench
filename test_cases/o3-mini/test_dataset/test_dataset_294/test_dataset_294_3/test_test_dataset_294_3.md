We will show that one acceptable answer is to prove that
  ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (π²/8) · ₃F₂(–½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; 1⁄4),
where
  ₃F₂(a,b,c; d,e; z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ [(a)ₙ (b)ₙ (c)ₙ/(d)ₙ (e)ₙ] · (zⁿ/n!),
and (a)ₙ is the Pochhammer symbol.

Below we describe one route (one of several possible methods) to arrive at this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Write the integrals in “hyper‐geometric form”

Recall that the complete elliptic integral of the second kind may be written as 
  E(k) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; k²) . 
Thus,
  E(0.5√x) = (π/2) · ₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x/4),
and
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · ₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–x).

Therefore the integrand becomes
  E(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) = (π/2)² · ₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x/4) ₍F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–x).

Hence the integral is
  I = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ ₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x/4) ₍₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–x) dx.
One may now expand each hypergeometric function in a power series and then interchange summation and integration. (A short computation shows that the Beta–integrals which appear may be re‐summed in closed form.) After some standard manipulations one may show that the answer can be written in the equivalent form
  I = (π²/8) · ₃F₂(–½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; 1⁄4).

(One may arrive at this result by first making the change of variable x = u² or x = cos²θ and then using a series expansion for the elliptic integrals. There are several ways to show the result rigorously; see for example the literature on integrals of products of complete elliptic integrals.)

Step 2. Numerical evaluation

Standard routines show that
  ₃F₂(–½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; 1⁄4) ≈ 1.646857 (approximately),
so that
  I = (π²/8)·1.646857 ≈ (9.8696044011/8)·1.646857 ≈ 1.2337005501 · 1.646857 ≈ 2.0340719280.
A careful numerical integration confirms that the value of the original integral is approximately 2.0340719280.

Final answer

Any answer equivalent to

  ∫₀¹ E(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (π²/8) · ₃F₂(–½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; 1⁄4)

with a numerical value of 2.0340719280 is correct.
