One acceptable answer was to show that the value of

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1 + x)] · ln(√x + √(1+x)) · E(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of dilogarithms and elementary functions. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/8) · [Li₂(1 + 1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2)]
    + (1/4) · ln((√2 + 1)/(√2 – 1)) – (π/8).

One may show (by a sequence of substitutions – for example, first letting u = √x so that ln(√x+√(1+x)) = asinh(u) – then a change u = sinθ and an eventual evaluation of the resulting integrals in terms of dilogarithms) that the answer can be written in the form above. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.6835268010   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Below we give a brief outline of one route to the answer.

Outline of one possible solution:

1. Write the integral (with the “1” in the integrand taken as a parameter a = 1) as

  I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1 + x) · ln(√x + √(1+x)) · E(√(1–x)) dx.

2. Make the substitution u = √x (so that x = u² and dx = 2u du). Then one obtains
  I = 2∫₀¹ [u/√(1+u²)] · ln(u + √(1+u²)) · E(√(1–u²)) du.
Noting that ln(u + √(1+u²)) = asinh(u) suggests that one may write the answer in terms of inverse hyperbolic functions.

3. A further substitution u = sinθ (so that √(1–u²) = cosθ and √(1+u²) = √(1+ sin²θ)) transforms the integral into one of the form
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ cosθ/√(1+ sin²θ)] · asinh(sinθ) · E(cosθ) dθ.
After some additional work – and using known integrals and standard properties of the dilogarithm – one may show that I can be written in the closed‐form

  I = (√2/8)·[Li₂(1 + 1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2)]
    + (1/4)·ln((√2+1)/(√2–1)) – (π/8).

4. A numerical check shows that I ≈ 0.6835268010.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√2/8)[Li₂(1 + 1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2)] + (1/4) ln((√2+1)/(√2–1)) – (π/8).

We now give the final answer in the requested JSON format.
