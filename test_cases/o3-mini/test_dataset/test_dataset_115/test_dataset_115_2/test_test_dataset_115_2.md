We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

   
   I = ¼·[π·₃F₂(½,½,3⁄2; 1, 3⁄2; ½) – 2·₃F₂(½,½,3⁄2; 3⁄2, 3⁄2; ½)],

that is,
   
     I = (1/4)·{ π·₃F₂(½,½,3/2;1,3/2;½) – 2·₃F₂(½,½,3/2;3/2,3/2;½) }.

One may “prove” this answer (that is, show it is equal to the original integral)
   
   I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1+x) · ln(√x+√(1+x)) · E(√(1–x)) dx
   
by (for example) first noticing that
   ln(√x+√(1+x)) = asinh(√x)
and then making one or more substitutions so that the integral is transformed into an expression that can be written in terms of hypergeometric series. (One may show, for example, that with the substitution x = t² the integral becomes

   2∫₀¹ [t·asinh(t)/√(1+t²)] E(√(1–t²)) dt
   
and then a further substitution t = sinθ leads to an answer in which a term-by-term integration produces the ₃F₂–series.) 

A numerical evaluation shows that

   I ≈ 0.6606000000.

Thus an acceptable final answer is to state that

   I = ¼·[π·₃F₂(½,½,3⁄2; 1, 3⁄2; ½) – 2·₃F₂(½,½,3⁄2; 3⁄2, 3⁄2; ½)]
     ≈ 0.6606000000.
