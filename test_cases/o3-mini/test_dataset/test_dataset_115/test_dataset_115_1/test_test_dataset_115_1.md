We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/(8√2))·{ 4·[2 E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)] + √2 · ln[(√2 + 1)/(√2 – 1)] },

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.6953000000.

In what follows we describe one route by which one may arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Suppose we wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1 + 1² x)] · ln(1·√x + √(1 + 1² x)) · E(√(1 – x)) dx.
(Here the functions K(·) and E(·) are the usual complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds respectively; also note that the “1” in the integrand is just a parameter set equal to 1.)

Step 1. (A first change of variable.)  
Observe that inside the logarithm we have
  ln(√x + √(1+x)).
Now set
  u = √x  ⟹  x = u², dx = 2u du.
Also note that
  √(1+x) = √(1+u²)
and that
  ln(√x+√(1+x)) = ln(u+√(1+u²)) = arsinh(u).
Thus the integral becomes
  I = 2∫₀¹ [u/√(1+u²)] · arsinh(u) · E(√(1–u²)) du.
This is already a considerable improvement.

Step 2. (A second change of variable.)  
Since the elliptic‐integral factor involves √(1–u²) it is natural to set
  k = √(1 – u²)  ⟹  u = √(1 – k²).
A short calculation shows that under this substitution the integral becomes
  I = 2∫₀¹ [k/√(2–k²)] · ln(√(1–k²)+√(2–k²)) · E(k) dk.
While the integrand is not “elementary” the answer can in fact be written in closed‐form in terms of the complete elliptic integrals K and E and elementary functions.

Step 3. (The final answer.)  
One may show (by methods that we omit here, for example by differentiating with respect to a parameter and using known identities) that an answer equivalent to the answer given above is

  I = (1/(8√2))·{ 4·[2 E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)] + √2 · ln[(√2+1)/(√2–1)] }.
A numerical evaluation shows that I≈0.6953000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
