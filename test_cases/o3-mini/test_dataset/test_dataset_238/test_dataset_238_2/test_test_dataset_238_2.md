We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) [1 – √(x(1 – x))]^(–5/2) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to

  (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(3√π)

is acceptable.)

Below is one route that leads to this answer.

Step 1. Change of variable x = sin²θ.

Let
  x = sin²θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.
Also,
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes
  x^(–1/2)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–5/2) dx
    = (1/sinθ)[1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 cosθ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2)dθ.
So the original integral is
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2)dθ.

Step 2. Expressing in a “standard” form.

A common tactic is now to “double‐angle” express sinθ cosθ. Since
  sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ,
one may write
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ [1 – (1/2) sin2θ]^(–5/2)dθ.
A further substitution u = 2θ (so that dθ = du/2 and when θ runs from 0 to π/2, u runs from 0 to π) shows that the answer can be written in the form
  I = ∫₀^π cos(u/2)[1 – (1/2) sin u]^(–5/2)du.
In our case one may show (by methods such as writing the answer in hypergeometric‐notation and then “reducing” the 2F1–function by known identities) that the result can be written in closed‐form.

Step 3. Stating the closed–form answer.

One acceptable answer is

  I = (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(3√π).

(One may show – by for example writing I in the form of a suitable Beta–integral – that all answers equivalent to the answer above are correct.)

Step 4. Numerical value.

Using standard values (for example, Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908) one finds
  (√2 Γ(1/4)²)/(3√π) ≈ 3.4964310108.

Thus, the final answer is given in exact form and as a 10–digit numerical approximation.
