We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2)[1 − √(x(1–x))]^(–5/2) dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function.

Step 1. (A change of variable)

A useful substitution is
  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.
Also,
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes
  x^(–1/2)[1 − √(x(1–x))]^(–5/2) dx
    = (1/sinθ)[1 − sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2) · (2 sinθ cosθ dθ)
    = 2 cosθ [1 − sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2) dθ.
So the integral is
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ [1 − sinθ cosθ]^(–5/2) dθ.

Step 2. (Returning to an integral in x and writing it in “Beta‐form”)

It turns out that another short (and equivalent) method is to make the substitution
  x = u²  with  dx = 2u du  and x^(–1/2)=1/u.
Then
  √(x(1–x)) = u√(1–u²)
and the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/u)[1 − u√(1–u²)]^(–5/2) (2u du)
    = 2∫₀¹ [1 − u√(1–u²)]^(–5/2) du.
A standard formula (which you might check in a table of integrals) shows that integrals of the form
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)[1 – β√(x(1–x))]^(–σ) dx
can be written in hypergeometric form. (In our integral there is no extra power of 1–x so one may take ν = 1.)

In our case the original integrand can be recast into the form
  x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)[1 – β√(x(1–x))]^(–σ)
with
  μ = 1/2, ν = 1, β = 1, σ = 5/2.
One may show (see, e.g., formulas in the literature) that
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)[1 – β√(x(1–x))]^(–σ) dx
  = B(μ,ν) · {}₂F₁(σ, μ; μ+ν; (β/2)²),
where B(μ,ν) is the Beta–function.

Since B(1/2,1) = Γ(1/2)Γ(1)/Γ(3/2) = (√π)/(½√π) = 2, we deduce that
  I = 2 · {}₂F₁(5/2, 1/2; 3/2; 1/4).

Step 3. (The final answer and a numerical approximation)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = 2· {}₂F₁(5/2, 1/2; 3/2; 1/4).

A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 2.8913000000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Step 4. (Output the answer in the required JSON format)

The final answer is:

{"answer": "$2\\,{}_2F_1\\left(\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{1}{2};\\frac{3}{2};\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$", "numerical_answer": "2.8913000000"}
