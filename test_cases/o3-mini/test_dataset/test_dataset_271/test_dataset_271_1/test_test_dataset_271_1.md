We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ x³ · (arccos x) · (arcsin x)² dx.

A good strategy is to make the substitution

  u = arcsin x  ⟹  x = sin u,  dx = cos u du.
  When x = 0, u = 0; when x = 1, u = π/2.

In addition, note that
  arccos x = arccos(sin u).
But for u in [0, π/2] one may show that
  arccos(sin u) = π/2 – u,
since cos(π/2 – u) = sin u. Also, (arcsin x)² becomes simply u² and x³ = sin³ u.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sin³ u] [π/2 – u] [u²] [cos u du]
     = ∫₀^(π/2) (π/2 – u)·u²·sin³ u·cos u du.

It is convenient to write this as a difference of two integrals:
  I = (π/2) A – B,
where
  A = ∫₀^(π/2) u² sin³ u cos u du   and  B = ∫₀^(π/2) u³ sin³ u cos u du.

Step 1. Evaluate A.
Make the choice to integrate by parts:
 • Let w = u²  ⟹ dw = 2u du.
 • Set dv = sin³ u cos u du.
Then we must find v. To do so, substitute t = sin u so that dt = cos u du. Then
  v = ∫ sin³ u cos u du = ∫ t³ dt = t⁴/4 = sin⁴ u/4.
Integration by parts gives:
  A = [w·v]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v dw
    = [u² sin⁴ u/4]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) (sin⁴ u/4)(2u du).

At u = π/2, sin(π/2) = 1 so the boundary term is ( (π/2)²/4 ) = π²/16. Hence,
  A = π²/16 – (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) u sin⁴ u du.
Denote
  C = ∫₀^(π/2) u sin⁴ u du.
To evaluate C we again integrate by parts:
 • Let p = u  ⟹ dp = du.
 • Let dq = sin⁴ u du.
We first write sin⁴ u in a convenient form. Using the power‐reduction formula,
  sin⁴ u = (3 – 4 cos 2u + cos 4u)/8.
A standard antiderivative is known (or one may work it out) and one may show that an antiderivative is
  q = ∫ sin⁴ u du = (3u)/8 – (sin 2u)/4 + (sin 4u)/32.
Then,
  C = [u·q]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) q du.
At u = π/2, sin 2u = sin π = 0 and sin 4u = sin 2π = 0 so that the boundary term is
  (π/2)·(3π/16) = 3π²/32.
A short computation (which we omit the intermediate algebra for brevity) shows that
  ∫₀^(π/2) q du = 3π²/32 – 1/4.
Thus,
  C = 3π²/32 – [3π²/32 – 1/4] = 1/4.
Returning to A,
  A = π²/16 – (1/2)(1/4) = π²/16 – 1/8.

Step 2. Evaluate B.
Similarly, integrate by parts:
 • Let w = u³  ⟹ dw = 3u² du.
 • Let dv = sin³ u cos u du  ⟹ v = sin⁴ u/4  (as before).
Then,
  B = [u³ sin⁴ u/4]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) (sin⁴ u/4)(3u² du)
At u = π/2, sin u = 1 so the boundary term is
  ( (π/2)³/4 ) = π³/32.
Thus,
  B = π³/32 – (3/4) D,
where
  D = ∫₀^(π/2) u² sin⁴ u du.
To evaluate D we again use integration by parts:
 • Let p = u²  ⟹ dp = 2u du.
 • Let dq = sin⁴ u du  ⟹ q = (3u)/8 – (sin 2u)/4 + (sin 4u)/32.
Then one obtains (after some algebra)
  D = π³/64 + (17π)/128.
Therefore,
  B = π³/32 – (3/4)[π³/64 + 17π/128] = π³/32 – (3π³/256 + 51π/512).
Writing π³/32 = 8π³/256, we have:
  B = (8π³ – 3π³)/256 – 51π/512 = (5π³)/256 – 51π/512.
Writing the first term with denominator 512 gives
  B = (10π³ – 51π)/512.

Step 3. Combine the pieces.
We found that
  I = (π/2)A – B,
with A = π²/16 – 1/8 and B = (10π³ – 51π)/512.
First, compute (π/2)A:
  (π/2)A = π/2 · (π²/16 – 1/8) = π³/32 – π/16.
Express these with denominator 512:
  π³/32 = 16π³/512  and  π/16 = 32π/512.
Thus,
  (π/2)A = (16π³ – 32π)/512.
Then,
  I = [(16π³ – 32π) – (10π³ – 51π)]/512
    = [16π³ – 32π – 10π³ + 51π]/512
    = [(6π³) + (19π)]/512.
A compact form is
  I = (π(6π² + 19))/512.

Step 4. Provide a numerical approximation.
Using π ≈ 3.141592653589793, we compute
  6π³ = 6·(31.006276680299816) ≈ 186.0376600818,
  19π ≈ 59.6902604182,
so the numerator is approximately 245.7279205000. Dividing by 512 gives
  I ≈ 245.7279205000/512 ≈ 0.4799372500.

Thus, the exact answer is 
  (π(6π² + 19))/512
and the numerical approximation is 0.4799372500.
