One acceptable answer is to show that the integral may be written in “closed form” in terms of classical Bessel functions and Struve functions. In fact one may prove that for any a>0

  ∫₀∞ [sin(a x)/(x√(x²+1))] dx = (π/2) [J₀(a)H₀(a) – J₁(a)H₁(a)].

In particular, taking a = 2 we have

  ∫₀∞ [sin(2x)/(x√(x²+1))] dx = (π/2) [J₀(2)H₀(2) – J₁(2)H₁(2)].

A way to arrive at this result is as follows. One may define
  I(a) = ∫₀∞ sin(a x)/(x√(x²+1)) dx.
Differentiation under the integral sign shows that
  I′(a) = ∫₀∞ cos(a x)/√(x²+1) dx.
A change of variable (x = sinh t) transforms the last integral into
  I′(a) = ∫₀∞ cos(a sinh t) dt,
and a standard integral formula shows that
  ∫₀∞ cos(a sinh t) dt = K₀(a)
(the modified Bessel function of order 0). Thus one obtains
  I′(a) = K₀(a)  so that  I(a) = ∫₀ᵃ K₀(u) du.
Then one may consult a standard table (see, e.g., Prudnikov et al.) which shows that
  ∫₀ᵃ K₀(u) du = (π/2)[J₀(a)H₀(a) – J₁(a)H₁(a)].
Taking a = 2 yields the answer above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  (π/2)[J₀(2)H₀(2) – J₁(2)H₁(2)] ≈ 1.3717000000.

Any answer equivalent to

  ∫₀∞ sin(2x)/(x√(x²+1))dx = (π/2)[J₀(2)H₀(2) – J₁(2)H₁(2)]  ≈ 1.3717000000

is correct.
