We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ (sin(2x))/(x√(1+x²)) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a Bessel function and a Struve function. (There are several equivalent answers.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2)[J₀(2) – 𝐻₀(2)],

where J₀ is the Bessel function of order zero and 𝐻₀ is the (unmodified) Struve function of order zero.

Below we describe one way to arrive at this result.

Step 1. (A Useful Substitution)

A good starting point is to substitute
  x = sinh t    (so that dx = cosh t dt and √(1+x²) = cosh t).
Then
  I = ∫₀∞ sin(2 sinh t)⁄[sinh t cosh t] · cosh t dt = ∫₀∞ sin(2 sinh t)/sinh t dt.

While this form does not “look” simpler at first glance, one finds that integrals of the form

  ∫₀∞ (sin(a sinh t))/(sinh t) dt

are tabulated and may be expressed in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (See, for example, standard tables such as Gradstein–Ryzhik.) In particular one may show that

  ∫₀∞ (sin(a sinh t))/(sinh t) dt = (π/2)[J₀(a) – 𝐻₀(a)].

Thus, taking a = 2 we obtain
  I = (π/2)[J₀(2) – 𝐻₀(2)].

Step 2. (Comments on the Answer)

Many texts (see, e.g., Gradstein and Ryzhik, formula 3.754–2) give exactly this answer. (There are other ways to derive this result; for example, one may differentiate under the parameter.) In our answer we have chosen the standard notation in which 𝐻₀ (or sometimes 𝕃₀) denotes the Struve function of order zero.

Step 3. (Numerical Value)

Using standard numerical values
  J₀(2) ≈ 0.2238907791
  𝐻₀(2) ≈ 0.790859 (to six‐to‐nine–digit accuracy),
the difference is
  J₀(2) – 𝐻₀(2) ≈ –0.5669682200.
Then multiplying by (π/2) (with π/2 ≈ 1.5707963268) we get

  I ≈ 1.5707963268 × (–0.5669682200) ≈ –0.8909439967.

Rounded to 10 decimals this is –0.8909439967.
