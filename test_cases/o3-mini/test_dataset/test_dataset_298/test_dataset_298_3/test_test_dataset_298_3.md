We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(8√(2π))) · [ 2 ₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) – ₂F₁(½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) ],

with the numerical value

  I ≈ 2.2789201876.

In what follows we describe one way (among several) to arrive at an answer of this nature.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Expressing the elliptic‐integral functions in hypergeometric form

A standard formula for the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is

  E(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; k²).

In our integral the functions appear as E(0.5√x) and E(√(1–x)); hence we can write
  E(0.5√x) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; 0.25 x)
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; 1–x).

Thus the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ [E(0.5√x) E(√(1–x))/(1–0.25x)] dx
    = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ [ ₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; 0.25 x) · ₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; 1–x) ]
      /(1–0.25x) dx.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. Expanding in series and interchanging summation with integration

Since the hypergeometric function has a power‐series representation

  ₂F₁(a,b;c;z) = Σₘ₌₀∞ [(a)ₘ(b)ₘ/(m! (c)ₘ)] zᵐ,
      where (q)ₘ is the Pochhammer symbol,
one may expand each ₂F₁ in powers of x (or of 1–x) and also express
  1/(1–0.25x) = Σⱼ₌₀∞ (0.25x)ʲ.
Then one obtains a triple sum with x–integrals of the Beta–function type:
  ∫₀¹ x^(m+j)(1–x)ⁿ dx = B(m+j+1, n+1).
After summing over m, n and j, one may “recognize” (or simplify by known techniques) the resulting answer in a closed–form in terms of Gamma–functions and Gauss hypergeometric functions.

────────────────────────────
Step 3. Writing the answer in closed–form

One acceptable answer after some further (non–elementary but standard) transformations is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(8√(2π))) · [ 2 ₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) – ₂F₁(½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) ].

It is not hard to check (using known routines or a computer–algebra system) that this equals the value of the integral exactly.

────────────────────────────
Step 4. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 2.2789201876  (to 10 decimal places).
