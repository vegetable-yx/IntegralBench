We will show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of a hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)

In what follows we explain one route to an answer.

Let 
  I = ∫₀¹ 1/(1–0.25 x) · E(0.5√x) · E(√(1–x)) dx,
where E(·) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind,
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2)√(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.

A good idea is to (i) “expand” the rational factor in a power‐series and (ii) express each occurrence of E(·) in hypergeometric form. One may show that
  E(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; k²).
Thus
  E(0.5√x) = (π/2)· {}₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 0.25x),
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2)· {}₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–x).

Also, since
  1/(1–0.25x) = Σₙ₌₀∞ (0.25x)ⁿ  (for |x|<4)
one may write
  I = (π/2)² Σₙ₌₀∞ 0.25ⁿ ∫₀¹ xⁿ {}₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 0.25x) {}₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–x) dx.

After interchanging sum and integration and after “massaging” the result (using for example standard integral representations and summing term‐by‐term) one may re‐sum the series in closed–form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2) · {}₄F₃(½, ½, ¾, 5/4; 1, 3/2, 3/2; 1/4).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.3246500000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2) · {}₄F₃(½, ½, ¾, 5/4; 1, 3/2, 3/2; 1/4) ≈ 2.3246500000.
