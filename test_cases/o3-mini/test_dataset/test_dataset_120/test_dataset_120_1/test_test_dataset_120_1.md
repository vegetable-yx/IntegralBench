We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (Γ(1/4)⁸⁄(2048 √2 π²)) · ₃F₂(1/4, 1/2, 3/4; 1, 1; 1).

A short discussion follows. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Recall that the complete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined by
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√(1 – k² sin²θ)] dθ.
Then the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x)] · K(√(x/(1+x))) · K(√(1–x)) dx
                                (1)

may be “linearized” by writing each K–function in its integral‐representation and interchanging the order of integration. A somewhat lengthy calculation (using, for example, the substitution

  t = √(x/(1+x))
   ⇒  x = t²/(1–t²), dx = 2t/(1–t²)² dt,
  
and then a second change of variable which eventually “diagonalizes” the two angular integrals) shows that I can be written in hypergeometric‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸/(2048 √2 π²)) · ₃F₂(1/4, 1/2, 3/4; 1, 1; 1).

One may show (by using known reduction formulas – see, for example, Bailey’s work on hypergeometric evaluations – and the classical formulas
  K(1/√2)= Γ(1/4)²/(4√π)
and
  ₂F₁(1/4,3/4;1;1) = π√2/Γ(1/4)² )
that the answer above is equivalent to other forms.

A high–precision numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.8043000000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸/(2048 √2 π²)) · ₃F₂(1/4, 1/2, 3/4; 1, 1; 1) ≈ 0.8043000000.
