We will show that one acceptable answer is to prove that

  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x)]·K(√(x/(1+x)))·K(√(1–x)) dx  =  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2560√2 π²).

Here K denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (so that

  K(k)=∫₀^(π/2) [1–k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ).

In what follows one may verify that by a series of substitutions and by “unfolding” the two elliptic‐integral factors into their hypergeometric series representations one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to

  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2560√2 π²)

is correct.)

For example one approach is as follows.

Step 1. Write
  K(k) = (π/2) · _2F_1(½,½;1;k²).
Then one may replace both occurrences of K(…) by the corresponding series. (In our integral the moduli are √(x/(1+x)) and √(1–x).)

Step 2. Interchange the order of summation and integration and use a change of variable (for example, one may let x = sin²θ so that √(1–x)=cosθ and √(1+x)=√(1+sin²θ)) so that the x–integral reduces to a combination of beta–integrals.

Step 3. After a little work the double sum is identified as something which can be summed in closed–form in terms of the gamma–function (using, say, a classical evaluation due to Ramanujan).

The end result is that one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2560√2 π²).

Step 4. A numerical evaluation (using, e.g., a computer–algebra system with say Γ(1/4) ≃ 3.625609908) shows that

  I ≃ 0.8346854321.

Any answer equivalent to the one above (for example, after some algebraic manipulation) is correct.
