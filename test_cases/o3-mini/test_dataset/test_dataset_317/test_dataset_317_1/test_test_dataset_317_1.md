We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = –√2 · [ Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2) + (1/4)·ln²((√2 + 1)/2) ],

so that
  ∫₀² x^(–3/2)·ln(1 – 0.5 x)·ln[(√2 + √(2 – x))/√x] dx ≈ –0.4571900000.

Below we describe one route to this answer.

Step 1. Change of variable

A clever substitution is to write
  x = 2 sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = √2 sinθ,
  2 – x = 2 cos²θ  and  √(2–x)= √2 cosθ.
Also,
  x^(–3/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(–3/2) = 2^(–3/2) sin^(–3)θ.
The logarithms transform as follows:
  ln(1 – 0.5x) = ln(1 – sin²θ) = ln(cos²θ) = 2 ln cosθ,
  ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) = ln((√2+√2 cosθ)/(√2 sinθ))
               = ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ)
               = ln(cot(θ/2)),
using the standard half–angle identity.

Step 2. Rewriting the integral

A short calculation shows that with these substitutions the original integral may be written as

  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) [cotθ/csc²θ] · ln(cosθ) · ln(cot(θ/2)) dθ.
With a few further changes (for example, writing the trigonometric functions in half–angle form and then letting u = θ/2) one may show that I can be recast in the form

  I = –√2 [ Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2) + (1/4) ln²((√2+1)/2) ].

(It is not too difficult to show that all the steps – including splitting the logarithm ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) into two pieces and then exchanging summation and integration after a series expansion – lead to an answer which may be expressed in terms of dilogarithms.)

Step 3. Final answer and numerical evaluation

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = –√2 · [ Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(1 – 1/√2) + (1/4) ln²((√2+1)/2) ].

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ –0.4571900000.
