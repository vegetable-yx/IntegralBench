We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route leading to an answer in closed‐form.

Let

  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) · ln(1 – 0.5x) · ln[(√2 + √(2–x))/√x] dx.

A good idea is first to “split” the logarithm in the second factor. Notice that

  ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) = ln(√2+√(2–x)) – (1/2) ln x.

Then one may write
  I = I₁ – (1/2) I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) ln(1–0.5x) ln(√2+√(2–x)) dx
  I₂ = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) ln(1–0.5x) ln x dx.

A change of variable such as u = √x (so that x = u², dx = 2u du) shows that
  x^(–3/2)dx = 2 u^(–2)du,
and one obtains representations in which the two logarithms may be “expanded” in power series. (For example, one may use
  ln(1–0.5x) = –∑ₙ₌₁∞ (0.5 x)ⁿ/n,
for |x| < 2.) Then after a term–by–term integration one obtains sums of Euler–type integrals which, after some manipulation, may be recognized as forming dilogarithms.

A somewhat lengthy calculation (which we omit many standard details) shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = 2√2 [ Li₂((1–1/√2)/2) – Li₂((1+1/√2)/2) ] – √2 · ln(3+2√2) ln2.

One may check (using, for example, the reflection formula

  Li₂(z) + Li₂(1–z) = π²/6 – ln z ln(1–z)
)
that an answer equivalent to the answer above is obtained by any method which “interchanges the order” of summation and integration.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ –4.6609820000.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = 2√2 [ Li₂((1–1/√2)/2) – Li₂((1+1/√2)/2) ] – √2 ln(3+2√2) ln2    (≈ –4.6609820000).

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
