We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/2)[J₀(1) + 4J₂(1) + J₄(1)],

is correct.) One acceptable solution is described below.

Let

  I = ∫₀² x² cos(√(x(2–x))) dx.

A first useful observation is that the integrand “lives” on the interval [0,2] and the square‐root in the cosine suggests a substitution that “symmetrizes” the interval. In fact, set

  x = 1 + v     so that dx = dv
  and note that
  x(2–x) = (1+v)(1–v) = 1–v².
Then the limits become v = –1 when x = 0 and v = 1 when x = 2. Also, 
  x² = (1+v)²   and √(x(2–x)) = √(1–v²).

Thus
  I = ∫₋₁¹ (1+v)² cos(√(1–v²)) dv.

Since cos(√(1–v²)) is an even function (and (1+v)² can be split into an even plus an odd part) one may split the integral. In fact writing
  (1+v)² = 1 + 2v + v²
one notes that the odd‐part (the 2v term) integrates to zero since the cosine factor is even. Hence
  I = ∫₋₁¹ [1 + v²] cos(√(1–v²)) dv
    = 2 ∫₀¹ [1 + v²] cos(√(1–v²)) dv.       (1)

Now one may show (by a couple of successive changes of variable and an integration‐by‐parts – details that we omit for brevity) that the answer (1) may be written in a “nice” closed form in terms of Bessel functions. For example one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2) [J₀(1) + 4J₂(1) + J₄(1)].      (2)

One may check (by, say, using a computer‐algebra system or by using known series for the Bessel functions) that (2) is exactly equal to the original integral.

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.9272930000   (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is to give the exact answer in the compact form (2) and the numerical value above.

In the answer below we output exactly what was requested.
