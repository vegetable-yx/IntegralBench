We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x^(2-1) e^(–1.0·x²) H₂(1.0·x) dx.

Since 2 – 1 = 1, the integrand becomes

  I = ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) H₂(x) dx.

Recall that the physicists’ Hermite polynomial of degree 2 is given by

  H₂(x) = 4x² – 2.

Thus, substitute H₂(x) into the integrand:

  I = ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) (4x² – 2) dx
    = 4 ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–x²) dx – 2 ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) dx.

Let’s denote these integrals by

  I₁ = ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–x²) dx  and  I₂ = ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) dx.

Step 1. Evaluate I₂:

Use the substitution u = x², so that du = 2x dx or x dx = du/2. When x goes from 0 to ∞, u goes from 0 to ∞. Then

  I₂ = ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) dx = 1/2 ∫₀∞ e^(–u) du = 1/2 [ –e^(–u)]₀∞
    = 1/2 [0 – (–1)] = 1/2.

Step 2. Evaluate I₁:

Again, use u = x² with du = 2x dx. Note that 
  x³ dx = x² (x dx) = x² (du/2).
Since u = x², it follows that x² = u. Then

  I₁ = ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–x²) dx = 1/2 ∫₀∞ u e^(–u) du.
Recognize that the Gamma function satisfies
  ∫₀∞ uⁿ⁻¹ e^(–u) du = Γ(n).
Here, n = 2 so that

  ∫₀∞ u e^(–u) du = Γ(2) = 1!
    = 1.
Thus,
  I₁ = 1/2 · 1 = 1/2.

Now, substituting I₁ and I₂ back into our original expression:

  I = 4 I₁ – 2 I₂ = 4(1/2) – 2(1/2) = 2 – 1 = 1.

Thus, the exact value of the integral is 1.

Step 3. Numerical Approximation:
Since the exact value is 1, the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 1.0000000000.
