We need to evaluate the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x^{2-1} e^(–1.0 x²) H₂(1.0x) dx.

Step 1. Recognize the Hermite polynomial.
The Hermite polynomial of order 2 (in the “physicists’” definition) is given by
  H₂(x) = 4x² – 2.
Thus, when the argument is 1.0x we have
  H₂(1.0x) = 4x² – 2.

Step 2. Substitute H₂(1.0x) into the integral.
Since x^(2-1) = x, the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) [4x² – 2] dx.
Expanding the integrand:
  I = 4 ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–x²) dx – 2 ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) dx.

Step 3. Evaluate the integrals.
Recall the standard formula for these integrals:
  ∫₀∞ xᵐ e^(–x²) dx = ½ Γ((m+1)/2).

• For m = 3:
  ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–x²) dx = ½ Γ((3+1)/2) = ½ Γ(2) = ½·1! = ½.

• For m = 1:
  ∫₀∞ x e^(–x²) dx = ½ Γ((1+1)/2) = ½ Γ(1) = ½·1 = ½.

Step 4. Combine the results.
Substitute the values back:
  I = 4 (½) – 2 (½) = 2 – 1 = 1.

Thus, the exact answer is 1.

Step 5. Compute the numerical approximation.
Since the exact value is 1, the numerical approximation (to 10 decimal places) is 1.0000000000.
