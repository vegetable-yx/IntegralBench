We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–½)(4 – x)^(–½) [1 – 0.25·x(4 – x)]^(½) dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution
  x = 4 sin²θ      (for θ from 0 to π/2).
Then, the differential becomes
  dx = 8 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Also,
  √x = 2 sinθ  and  √(4 – x) = 2 cosθ.
Thus,
  x^(–½) = 1/(2 sinθ)  and  (4 – x)^(–½) = 1/(2 cosθ).

So the product of these factors is
  x^(–½)(4 – x)^(–½) = 1/(4 sinθ cosθ).

Now substitute dx:
  dx * [1/(4 sinθ cosθ)] = [8 sinθ cosθ dθ] / [4 sinθ cosθ] = 2 dθ.

Step 2. Transform the remaining term.
Notice that
  x(4 – x) = (4 sin²θ)(4 cos²θ) = 16 sin²θ cos²θ.
Then,
  0.25·x(4 – x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Thus, the factor inside the square root becomes
  [1 – 4 sin²θ cos²θ]^(½).
Recall sin²θ cos²θ = (1/4) sin²2θ, so
  1 – 4 sin²θ cos²θ = 1 – sin²2θ.
Hence, the square root is
  [1 – sin²2θ]^(½) = |cos2θ|.
Since θ ∈ [0, π/2], cos2θ is positive for θ in [0, π/4] and negative for θ in [π/4, π/2]. We handle the absolute value by splitting the integral at θ = π/4.

Step 3. Write the integral in terms of θ.
The substitution has transformed the integral into
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) |cos2θ| dθ.
Do the split:
  I = 2 [∫₀^(π/4) cos2θ dθ + ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) (–cos2θ) dθ].

Step 4. Evaluate the two integrals.
The antiderivative of cos2θ is (1/2) sin2θ.

For the first part:
  ∫₀^(π/4) cos2θ dθ = (1/2)[sin2θ]₀^(π/4) = (1/2)(sin(π/2) – sin0) = (1/2)(1 – 0) = 1/2.
For the second part:
  ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) (–cos2θ) dθ = –(1/2)[sin2θ]_(π/4)^(π/2)
    = –(1/2)(sinπ – sin(π/2)) = –(1/2)(0 – 1) = 1/2.

Now, bring back the factor of 2:
  I = 2[(1/2) + (1/2)] = 2·1 = 2.

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
Since the exact value is 2, a numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is
  2.0000000000.
