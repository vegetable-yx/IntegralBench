We start with

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2)(1–x)^(–1/2) T₄(√(x(1–x))) dx.

Step 1. Change of variable.
Let
  x = sin²θ  ⇒ dx = 2sinθ cosθ dθ,
with limits: when x = 0, θ = 0; and when x = 1, θ = π/2.
Note also that
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ,
and
  x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ, (1–x)^(–1/2) = 1/cosθ.
Thus, the factors combine as
  x^(–1/2)(1–x)^(–1/2) dx = (1/(sinθ cosθ))·(2 sinθ cosθ dθ) = 2 dθ.
So the integral becomes 
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) T₄(sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Express T₄.
The Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of order 4 is
  T₄(z) = 8z⁴ – 8z² + 1.
Replacing z = sinθ cosθ, we have
  T₄(sinθ cosθ) = 8 (sinθ cosθ)⁴ – 8 (sinθ cosθ)² + 1.
Thus,
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2)[8(sinθ cosθ)⁴ – 8(sinθ cosθ)² + 1] dθ
    = 16∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)⁴ dθ – 16∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)² dθ + 2∫₀^(π/2) dθ.

Step 3. Evaluate the integrals.
For integrals of the form ∫₀^(π/2) sin^mθ cos^nθ dθ, we use
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^mθ cos^nθ dθ = (1/2) B((m+1)/2, (n+1)/2),
where B denotes the Beta function.

(a) For
  I_A = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)² dθ = ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cos²θ dθ,
we have m = 2, n = 2:
  I_A = ½ B((2+1)/2, (2+1)/2) = ½ B(3/2, 3/2).
Recall: B(3/2, 3/2) = [Γ(3/2)]²/Γ(3) with Γ(3/2) = (√π)/2 and Γ(3) = 2.
Thus,
  B(3/2, 3/2) = [(√π/2)²]/2 = (π/4)/2 = π/8,
and
  I_A = (1/2)(π/8) = π/16.

(b) For
  I_B = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)⁴ dθ = ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁴θ cos⁴θ dθ,
here m = 4, n = 4:
  I_B = ½ B((4+1)/2, (4+1)/2) = ½ B(5/2, 5/2).
Now, Γ(5/2) = (3√π)/4 and Γ(5) = 24, so
  B(5/2, 5/2) = [(Γ(5/2))²]/Γ(5) = [(3√π/4)²]/24 = (9π/16)/24 = 9π/384 = 3π/128,
and hence,
  I_B = ½·(3π/128) = 3π/256.

(c) The third term:
  I_C = 2∫₀^(π/2) dθ = 2·(π/2) = π.

Step 4. Combine the pieces.
Thus,
  I = 16 I_B – 16 I_A + I_C
   = 16·(3π/256) – 16·(π/16) + π
   = (48π/256) – π + π
   = 48π/256.
Simplify 48/256 by dividing numerator and denominator by 16:
  48/256 = 3/16.
So the final answer is
  I = 3π/16.

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
We have
  3π/16 ≈ 3×3.141592653589793/16 ≈ 9.42477796076938/16 ≈ 0.5890486225.
