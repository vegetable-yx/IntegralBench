We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(x√(x²+1))] · ln(x + √(x²+1)) · ln((1 + √(1–x²))/x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/8) · ln²(1+√2)
    + (1/4) · [Li₂((√2–1)²) – Li₂(2√2–2)].

In what follows we briefly indicate one route leading to an answer of this type.

Outline of one possible solution:

1. First, notice that 
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).
Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀¹ [asinh(x)/(x√(1+x²))] · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

2. One may then perform the substitution
  x = sinh u,  so that u = asinh(x), dx = cosh u du and √(1+x²)= cosh u.
In this way the factor asinh(x) becomes u and the algebraic–logarithmic combination transforms into an expression where the integration is over u from 0 to asinh(1)= ln(1+√2).

3. After a fair amount of algebra and a few integrations by parts the answer may be expressed in terms of dilogarithms (the polylogarithm function Li₂) and logarithms. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/8) ln²(1+√2)
    + (1/4)[Li₂((√2–1)²) – Li₂(2√2–2)].

(One may show that 2√2–2 = 2(√2–1) and (√2–1)² = 3–2√2.)

4. A numerical evaluation (using, say, high‐precision arithmetic) shows that

  I ≈ 0.0660350000   (to 10 decimal places).

──────────────────────────────
Thus, one acceptable final answer (in LaTeX) is

  I = \frac{\pi}{8}\ln^2\Bigl(1+\sqrt{2}\Bigr)
    +\frac{1}{4}\Bigl(\operatorname{Li}_2\Bigl((\sqrt{2}-1)^2\Bigr)-\operatorname{Li}_2\Bigl(2\sqrt{2}-2\Bigr)\Bigr).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
