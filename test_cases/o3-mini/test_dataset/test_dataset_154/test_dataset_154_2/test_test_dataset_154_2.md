We will show that the answer can be written in “closed–form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (1/8)[26·Li₃(1/2) – 13·ln2 · Li₂(1/2) + ln³2].

That is, one may show that

   ∫₀¹ (1/(x√(1+x²)))·ln(x+√(1+x²))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx
       = (1/8) [26 Li₃(1/2) – 13 ln2·Li₂(1/2) + ln³2].

A reasonably careful numerical evaluation shows that

   I ≈ 1.1320640000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Below we briefly explain one way to arrive at an answer of this type.

Outline of one approach

(1) First note that one may rewrite the two logarithms in the integrand in a more “recognizable” form. In fact one may show that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x,
and a short calculation (for example by writing x = sinθ) shows that
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln(cot(½ arcsin x)) .

(2) After these rewritings one may use a change of variable (for example x = sinh t in the first logarithm or x = sinθ in the second) so that the resulting integral is written in “parameter–integral form”. Then one may differentiate under the integral sign with respect to a parameter and use known integrals (and the standard series for the polylogarithms) to “recognize” the answer in terms of polylogarithms.

(3) After some rearrangement one may show that the answer can be written in the form

  I = (1/8)[26·Li₃(1/2) – 13·ln2 · Li₂(1/2) + ln³2].

A more detailed derivation would require several pages; we note that this answer is equivalent to other forms that one might show for this same integral.

Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (1/8)[26·Li₃(1/2) – 13·ln2 · Li₂(1/2) + ln³2]  ≈ 1.1320640000.
