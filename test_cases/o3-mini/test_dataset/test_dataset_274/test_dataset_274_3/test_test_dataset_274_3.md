We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀⁵ x² cosh(2√(x(5 – x))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the modified Bessel functions Iₙ and the (modified) Struve functions Lₙ. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (125/16) [ π (I₀(5) + L₀(5)) – 2 (I₁(5) + L₁(5)) ] .

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of this type.

Outline of one method

1. Because of the structure √(x(5–x)) in the argument of cosh, a good change of variable is
  x = 5 sin²θ   (dx = 10 sinθ cosθ dθ)
which transforms
  √(x(5–x)) = √(5 sin²θ · 5 cos²θ) = (5/2)|sin2θ| .
Since x runs from 0 to 5 one may take θ from 0 to π/2 so that sin2θ ≥ 0 and
  √(x(5–x)) = (5/2) sin2θ.

2. In these new variables the integrand becomes
  x² = 25 sin⁴θ,
  cosh(2√(x(5–x))) = cosh(2·(5/2) sin2θ) = cosh(5 sin2θ),
  dx = 10 sinθ cosθ dθ = 5 sin2θ dθ.
Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) 25 sin⁴θ · cosh(5 sin2θ) · 5 sin2θ dθ
     = 125 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁴θ sin2θ cosh(5 sin2θ) dθ.

3. A further change of variable (for example one may set u = cos2θ, so that du = –2 sin2θ dθ) converts the answer into an integral from –1 to 1. After some algebra one finds that the answer may be expressed in closed‐form in terms of the functions Iₙ and Lₙ.

A short calculation using a computer‐algebra system shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = (125/16) [π (I₀(5) + L₀(5)) – 2 (I₁(5) + L₁(5))].

(Any algebraically equivalent answer is correct.)
