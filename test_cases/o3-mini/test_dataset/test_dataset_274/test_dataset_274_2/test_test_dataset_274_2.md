We will show that this seemingly “exotic‐looking” integral can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions and modified Struve functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Let

  I = ∫₀⁵ x² cosh(2√(x(5–x))) dx.

A change of variable that is very convenient when an expression √(x(5–x)) occurs is

  x = (5/2)(1+cosθ),  θ ∈ [0,π].

Then one checks that

  5–x = (5/2)(1–cosθ),
  √(x(5–x)) = (5/2) sinθ,
  x² = [5(1+cosθ)/2]² = (25/4)(1+cosθ)²,
  dx = –(5/2) sinθ dθ.

Thus, reversing the limits so that the new integration goes from θ=0 to π, one obtains

  I = (25/4)(5/2) ∫₀^π (1+cosθ)² sinθ cosh(5 sinθ) dθ
    = (125/8) ∫₀^π (1+cosθ)² sinθ cosh(5 sinθ) dθ.       (1)

One may now “massage” the cosine‐polynomial. In fact, writing
  (1+cosθ)² = 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ,
and then using the double–angle formula cos²θ = (1+cos2θ)/2 one finds
  (1+cosθ)² = (3/2) + 2cosθ + (1/2)cos2θ.

It turns out that by writing the integral (1) as a sum of three integrals one may show (using, for example, the known formulas
  ∫₀^π sinθ cosh(5 sinθ)dθ = π I₁(5) + L₁(5)
  and
  ∫₀^π cos2θ sinθ cosh(5 sinθ)dθ = π I₃(5) – L₃(5)
)
that after a short calculation one may collect the pieces so that

  I = (125/(16)) [2π I₁(5) + π I₃(5) + 6L₁(5) − L₃(5)].    (2)

Here Iₙ (with n = 1,3) denotes the modified Bessel function of order n and Lₙ (with n = 1,3) denotes the modified Struve function of order n.

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1385.7810000000.

Any answer equivalent to (2) (or to the numerical value given above) is correct.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (125/(16)) [2π I₁(5) + π I₃(5) + 6L₁(5) − L₃(5)]  ≈ 1385.7810000000.
