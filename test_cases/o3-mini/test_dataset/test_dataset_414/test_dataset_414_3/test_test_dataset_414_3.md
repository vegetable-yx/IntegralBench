We begin with the integral

  I = ∫ from -e to e [e^(–x^2024) cos(2024x) / arctan(2024x)] dx.

Step 1. Check the parity of the integrand:

Let f(x) = e^(–x^2024) cos(2024x) / arctan(2024x).

Now calculate f(–x):
 • Note that since 2024 is even, (–x)^2024 = x^2024.
 • Also, cos(2024(–x)) = cos(–2024x) = cos(2024x) because cosine is even.
 • And arctan(2024(–x)) = –arctan(2024x) because the arctan function is odd.

Thus,
  f(–x) = e^(–x^2024) cos(2024x) / (–arctan(2024x)) = –[e^(–x^2024) cos(2024x) / arctan(2024x)] = –f(x).

This shows that f(x) is an odd function.

Step 2. Use the property of odd functions:
For any odd function f(x) (that is, f(–x) = –f(x)) and a symmetric interval [–a, a], we have
  ∫ from –a to a f(x) dx = 0.

Thus, the given integral I is exactly 0.

Note on the singularity at x = 0: Although arctan(2024x) vanishes at x = 0, near x = 0 we have
  arctan(2024x) ≈ 2024x,
and
  e^(–x^2024) ≈ 1, cos(2024x) ≈ 1.
Hence, the integrand behaves like
  1/(2024x),
which is singular at x = 0. However, since this singularity appears in an odd fashion, the contributions from the negative and positive sides cancel exactly. The integral, interpreted as a principal value integral, is therefore 0.

Step 3. Numerical approximation:
Since the exact value is 0, the numerical approximation (to ten decimal places) is 0.0000000000.
