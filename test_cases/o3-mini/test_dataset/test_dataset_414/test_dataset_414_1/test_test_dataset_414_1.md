We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from –e to e [e^(–x^(2024)) · cos(2024x)] / [arctan(2024x)] dx.

Step 1. Check the parity of the integrand.

Let
  f(x) = e^(–x^(2024)) · cos(2024x) / arctan(2024x).

Replace x by –x.

• Since 2024 is even, (–x)^(2024) = x^(2024) so:
  e^(–(–x)^(2024)) = e^(–x^(2024)).

• Cosine is even:
  cos(2024(–x)) = cos(2024x).

• The arctan function is odd:
  arctan(2024(–x)) = – arctan(2024x).

Thus,
  f(–x) = e^(–x^(2024)) · cos(2024x) / (– arctan(2024x))
       = – f(x).

This shows that f(x) is an odd function.

Step 2. Integration over a symmetric interval.

The integral of any odd function over [–a, a] is zero provided the integral is defined in the (possibly improper) sense. (Here one must treat x = 0 carefully because arctan(2024x) vanishes there. However, one may define the integral as

  I = lim (ε → 0⁺) ( ∫ from –e to –ε f(x) dx + ∫ from ε to e f(x) dx ).

The singular behavior at x = 0 is symmetric and cancels out.)

Thus, we conclude that

  I = 0.

Step 3. Numerical approximation.

Since I = 0 exactly, the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).
