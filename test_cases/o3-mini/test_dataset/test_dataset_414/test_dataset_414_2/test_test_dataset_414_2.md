We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from x = –e to x = e of [e^(–x^(2024))·cos(2024x)] / [arctan(2024x)] dx.

Step 1. Check the parity of the integrand.

Define
  f(x) = e^(–x^(2024))·cos(2024x) / arctan(2024x).

Analyze each factor:
 • The function e^(–x^(2024)) is even because the exponent x^(2024) (with 2024 even) is even.
 • The cosine function cos(2024x) is even.
 • The function arctan(2024x) is odd (since arctan is odd, i.e. arctan(–u) = –arctan(u)).

Hence under x → –x:
  f(–x) = [even · even] / [odd] = (even)/(–odd) = – [even/odd] = –f(x).
Thus, f(x) is an odd function.

Step 2. Use symmetry of integration.

For any odd function f defined (in a symmetric sense) on [–a, a]:
  ∫ from –a to a f(x) dx = 0,
provided that the integral is defined in the principal value sense.

In our case, although the denominator arctan(2024x) equals 0 at x = 0 (producing a singularity), note that near x = 0 the behavior is as follows:
  arctan(2024x) ≈ 2024x  and therefore
  f(x) ≈ [e^(–x^(2024))·cos(2024x)]/(2024x) ≈ 1/(2024x),
which indeed has a non–removable singularity. 

However, the standard definition of an improper integral when there is an interior singularity is to split the integral as

  I = lim (δ → 0⁺) [∫ from –e to –δ f(x) dx + ∫ from δ to e f(x) dx].

Because f(x) is odd the two halves are negatives of each other. Hence, the Cauchy principal value is zero:
  I = 0.

Step 3. Conclude the answer.

The exact value (in the sense of the principal value) is 0. The numerical approximation is 0.0000000000 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
