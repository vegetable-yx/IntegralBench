We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₁(2x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/4) · [1 + Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)⁴)].

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Integration by parts

Let
  u = arccos x    ⇒ du = –dx/√(1–x²),
  dv = J₁(2x) dx.
To find v note that after the change of variable t = 2x (so that dt = 2 dx) we have
  v = ∫ J₁(2x) dx = ½ ∫ J₁(t) dt.
But since d/dt J₀(t) = –J₁(t) it follows that
  ∫ J₁(t) dt = –J₀(t) ⇒ v = –(1/2) J₀(2x).

Then, by integration by parts,
  I = [u v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v du.

Let us compute the boundary term:
  at x = 1, arccos 1 = 0, so u v = 0;
  at x = 0, arccos 0 = π/2 and J₀(0)=1 so v = –½.
Thus
  [u v]₀¹ = (0 – ( (π/2)(–1/2) )) = π/4.

Also,
  ∫₀¹ v du = ∫₀¹ (–½ J₀(2x)) (–dx/√(1–x²))
         = ½ ∫₀¹ J₀(2x) dx/√(1–x²).

Thus we obtain
  I = π/4 + (1/2) ∫₀¹ J₀(2x) dx/√(1–x²).           (1)

Step 2. Changing the variable in the remaining integral

Make the substitution
  x = sinθ  , dx = cosθ dθ, and √(1–x²) = cosθ.
When x goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from 0 to π/2. Then the remaining integral becomes

  I₂ = ∫₀¹ J₀(2x) dx/√(1–x²)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) J₀(2 sinθ) (cosθ dθ)/cosθ
    = ∫₀^(π/2) J₀(2 sinθ) dθ.

Thus (1) reads

  I = π/4 + (1/2) I₂     where     I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) J₀(2 sinθ)dθ.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Expanding the Bessel function in power series

Recall that
  J₀(z) = Σₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² ] (z/2)^(2m).
Thus, putting z = 2 sinθ we have
  J₀(2 sinθ) = Σₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² ] (sinθ)^(2m).

It follows that
  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) Σₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² ] (sinθ)^(2m) dθ
     = Σₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² ] ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2m)dθ.

But a standard formula (see e.g. Gradstein‐Ryzhik) is
  ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2m) dθ = (√π · Γ(m + ½))/(2 Γ(m + 1)).

Therefore,
  I₂ = (√π/2) Σₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² ] · [Γ(m + ½)/Γ(m + 1)].

Now use the duplication formula to write
  Γ(m+½) = ( (2m)!/(4ᵐ m!) ) √π  and  Γ(m+1) = m!.
Thus
  Γ(m+½)/Γ(m+1) = (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)²) √π.
So that
  I₂ = (√π/2) Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(m!)² · [ (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)²) √π ]
     = (π/2) Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)⁴).

Returning to (1) we have found that

  I = π/4 + (1/2) I₂ = π/4 + (π/4) Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)⁴).

That is, an acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) · [ 1 + Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ (2m)!/(4ᵐ (m!)⁴) ].

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Numerical evaluation

A short numerical calculation shows that
  I ≈ 1.2449999999.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the value is 1.2450000000.
