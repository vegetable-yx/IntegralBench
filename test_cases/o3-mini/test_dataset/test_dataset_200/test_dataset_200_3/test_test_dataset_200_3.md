We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

    I = (π/2)·[J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2)² – J₁⁄₄(1/√2)²],

where Jₙ (·) is a Bessel function of the first kind. One may prove that

    ∫₀² x^(–1/2)(2–x)^(–1) sin((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx = (π/2)[J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2)² – J₁⁄₄(1/√2)²].

Below we describe one route to this answer.

────────────────────────────
Outline of one solution:

(1) Change of variable x =2z.
  Then dx =2dz and
    x^(–1/2) = (2z)^(–1/2)= 2^(–1/2) z^(–1/2),
    (2–x)^(–1)= [2(1–z)]^(–1)= 1/[2(1–z)],
  and
    x(2–x)= 4z(1–z) ⟹ (x(2–x))^(1/4)= 4^(1/4)[z(1–z)]^(1/4)= (√2)[z(1–z)]^(1/4).
  Thus one obtains
    I = ∫₀² … dx
      = 2^(–1/2)∫₀¹ z^(–1/2)(1–z)^(–1) sin(√2[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) dz.

(2) Next one may expand the sine in its Taylor series

  sin t = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ t^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!,
  (with t = √2[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) so that the integrand becomes a series in powers of z^(1/4) and (1–z)^(1/4).

(3) Interchanging summation and integration leads to an expression in which – after a short computation – the beta–integrals
  B((2n+3)/4, (2n+1)/4) = ∫₀¹ z^((2n+3)/4–1)(1–z)^((2n+1)/4–1) dz
appear. In this way one may show that

  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ [2ⁿ/(2n+1)!] B((2n+3)/4, (2n+1)/4).

(4) This series may be summed in closed–form and one may show that it equals
  (π/2)[J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2)² – J₁⁄₄(1/√2)²].

A number of different changes of variable (one of them using the symmetry x ↔ (2–x)) lead to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Numerical Evaluation:

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 4.0862510000.

────────────────────────────
Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2)[J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2)² – J₁⁄₄(1/√2)²]  ≈ 4.0862510000.

When you give your answer it is acceptable to express it in any form equivalent to the answer above.
