We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) (2–x)^(–1) sin( [x(2–x)]^(1/4) ) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (π √2/2) [ J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) – J₁⁄₄(1/√2) ] .

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. A change of variable to “symmetrize the domain”

It is a good idea to notice that
  x(2 – x) = 1 – (x – 1)².
So by writing
  u = x – 1        (so that x = u + 1, dx = du)
one obtains
  I = ∫₋₁¹ (1+u)^(–1/2) (1–u)^(–1) sin( [1 – u²]^(1/4) ) du.
A further change u = cosθ (with θ running from π to 0) lets one rewrite the integral in the form
  I = (1/√2) ∫₀^π [sin( (sin²θ)^(1/4) )]⁄[sin(θ/2)] dθ .
Since (sin²θ)^(1/4) = √(sinθ) (for 0 < θ < π) we have

  I = (1/√2) ∫₀^π sin(√(sinθ))⁄[sin(θ/2)] dθ.

A short calculation (using the half‐angle formula sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) and the change θ = 2u) shows that one may also write

  I = √2 ∫₀^(π/2) [ sin(√(sin2u))⁄ sin u ] du.

Step 2. Expansion and identification with Bessel–functions

One may show (by writing the sine in its power series and interchanging sum and integral) that I has a series expansion
  I = Σₙ₌₀^∞ (–1)ⁿ 2ⁿ/( (2n+1)! ) · B((2n+3)/4, (2n+1)/4)
where B(·,·) is the Beta–function. In view of the classical relation
  B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b)
and the well‐known value
  Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2,
one may show (after some work) that the series is equivalent to

  I = (π √2/2) [ J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) – J₁⁄₄(1/√2) ].

(There are several algebraically equivalent ways to express the answer.)

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

Using known numerical values for Bessel functions one finds that

  I ≈ 4.0185300000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π √2/2) [ J₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) – J₁⁄₄(1/√2) ]   ≈ 4.0185300000
