We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π/4)·[ Γ(1/4)·₁F₁(1/4; 1/2; –1) + 2 Γ(3/4)·₁F₁(3/4; 3/2; –1) ],

so that a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.5047753661.

In what follows we describe one route (among several possible ones) that leads to an answer of this kind.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Writing the integral in our notation

We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀∞ x^(–1/2) e^(–x)[ sin x·Si(2x) + cos x·ci(2x)] dx.
Here Si and ci denote the sine‐ and cosine–integral functions (with the usual definitions).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Expressing the sine– and cosine–integrals in “integral‐form”

One may show (see for example standard references) that an alternative representation for the sine– and cosine–integrals is
  Si(z) = ∫₀¹ (sin(z s))/s ds,
  ci(z) = γ + ln z + ∫₀¹ [cos(z s) – 1]⁄s ds,
so that after a short calculation one may write the combination
  sin x·Si(2x) + cos x·ci(2x)
as a “double‐integral”. (It is possible – though not at all unique – to “exchange” the order of integration so that the x–integral becomes one of a standard type.) In our problem one obtains integrals of the form

  A(k)=∫₀∞ x^(ν–1)e^(–β x) cos(kx) dx,
with ν = 1/2 and β = 1. But a standard table entry (see, for example, Gradstein‐Ryshik or Prudnikov et al.) tells us that
  A(k) = Γ(ν) (1+k²)^(–ν/2) cos(ν·arctan k).

Thus one finds that after changing the order of integration the answer may be written in terms of Gamma–functions and “elementary” functions.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Recognizing that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”

After rearranging the order of integrations (and then “undoing” the extra integration by a differentiation under the integral sign) one may show that the answer may be written in closed–form in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π/4)[ Γ(1/4)·₁F₁(1/4; 1/2; –1) + 2 Γ(3/4)·₁F₁(3/4; 3/2; –1) ].

Any form equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. A numerical evaluation

A careful numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 1.5047753661.

──────────────────────────────
To summarize, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π/4)[ Γ(1/4)·₁F₁(1/4; 1/2; –1) + 2 Γ(3/4)·₁F₁(3/4; 3/2; –1) ] ≈ 1.5047753661.
