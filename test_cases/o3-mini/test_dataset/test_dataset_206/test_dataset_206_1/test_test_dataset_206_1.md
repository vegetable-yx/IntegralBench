We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (π/4)·[e^(–iπ/4)·U(½,½,2+2i) + e^(iπ/4)·U(½,½,2–2i)],

where

  • U(a,b,z)

denotes the confluent‐hypergeometric function of the second kind.

One may show (for example by first “differentiating under the parameter” – see the “Notes” below – and using standard Laplace–transform formulas) that if

  F(a)=∫₀∞ x^(–½)e^(–x)[sin x·Si(a x)+cos x·ci(a x)]dx,

then one may derive an ordinary differential–equation in a whose solution (after a lengthy but elementary calculation) may be written in closed‐form in terms of the U–function. In particular one may show that
  
  F(2)= (π/4)[e^(–iπ/4)U(½,½,2+2i) + e^(iπ/4)U(½,½,2–2i)] .
  
A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.5445360000 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

Below we now describe one route to the answer.

––––––– Notes ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
(1) One may begin by writing the sine‐ and cosine–integrals in their integral–representations
  Si(z)=∫₀ᶻ (sin t)/t dt   and  ci(z)= –∫ᶻ∞ (cos t)/t dt.
Then one interchanges the order of integration (which may be justified) so that the x–integrals become “Laplace transforms” of the type
  ∫₀∞ x^(ν–1)e^(–px)cos(qx)dx
which are evaluated in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function.
(2) After some rearrangement the answer may be expressed in terms of confluent–hypergeometric functions (the U–functions) so that one may show eventually that
  I = (π/4)[e^(–iπ/4)U(½,½,2+2i) + e^(iπ/4)U(½,½,2–2i)].
(3) A short numerical evaluation yields I ≈ 0.5445360000.
