We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x^(–½) e^(–x)[sin x · Si(2x) + cos x · ci(2x)] dx

can be written in a “closed‐form” answer. (Any algebraically equivalent form is acceptable.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π/2^(1/4)) · { [γ + 3 ln 2 – (1/2) ln 10] cos(π/8) – [arctan 3] sin(π/8) }.

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

A “sketch” of one method:

1. We first note that a useful rewriting is to combine the sine– and cosine–integral functions into one complex expression. In our notation the standard definitions are

  Si(z) = ∫₀ᶻ (sin t)/t dt  and  ci(z) = –∫ᶻ∞ (cos t)/t dt.

One may show (see, e.g., formulas in standard texts) that
  ci(2x) + i Si(2x) = Ei(2ix) + i(π/2),
so that
  sin x Si(2x) + cos x ci(2x) = Re{ e^(ix)[ci(2x) + i Si(2x)] }
                   = Re{ e^(ix)[Ei(2ix) + iπ/2] }.

Thus the integral becomes
  I = Re { ∫₀∞ x^(–½) e^(–x) e^(ix)[Ei(2ix) + iπ/2] dx }.
We then write I = Re{A + B} with
  A = ∫₀∞ x^(–½)e^(–(1–i)x)Ei(2ix) dx  and  B = (iπ/2) ∫₀∞ x^(–½)e^(–(1–i)x)dx.

2. The second term B is an elementary Laplace‐type integral. In fact,
  ∫₀∞ x^(–½)e^(–λx)dx = Γ(1/2)/λ^(1/2)
for any λ with Re λ > 0. In our case λ = 1 – i so that
  B = iπ/2 · (√π/(1–i)^(1/2)).

3. The first term A (which involves Ei) may be looked up in tables (see, for example, Gradstein‐Ryshik or formulas from the Bateman Project) in the form
  ∫₀∞ x^(μ–1)e^(–βx)Ei(–αx)dx = Γ(μ)/β^μ [ψ(μ) – ln(β/ (β+α))],
with appropriate conditions on the parameters. In our problem one has to use analytic‐continuation (by writing
  Ei(2ix) = –Ei(–(–2i)x))
with μ = 1/2, β = 1 – i and α = –2i. One then finds after some algebra
  A = – √π/(1–i)^(1/2) [ψ(1/2) + ln((1–3i)/(–2i))].
Now using the well–known formula
  ψ(1/2) = –γ – 2 ln2,
and writing ln((1–3i)/(–2i)) in polar‐form (one may show that ln((1–3i)/(–2i)) = ln|1–3i| – ln2 + i(π/2 – arg(1–3i)) = (½ ln10 – ln2) – i arctan3),
one eventually obtains
  A + B = (√π/(1–i)^(1/2)) · { γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10 + iπ/2 – iπ/2 + i arctan3 }.
That is, after cancellation of the iπ/2 from B and from A,
  A + B = (√π/(1–i)^(1/2)) · { γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10 + i arctan3 }.
Taking the real part then yields
  I = √π · Re{ (1/(1–i)^(1/2)) [γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10 + i arctan3] }.

4. Write 1 – i in polar‐form:
  1 – i = √2 e^(–iπ/4)  so that  (1 – i)^(–1/2) = 2^(–1/4)e^(iπ/8).
Then one obtains
  I = (√π/2^(1/4)) · Re{ e^(iπ/8)[γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10 + i arctan3] }.
A short calculation (writing e^(iπ/8) = cos(π/8)+ i sin(π/8)) shows that
  Re{ e^(iπ/8)[R + iI] } = R cos(π/8) – I sin(π/8),
with R = γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10 and I = arctan3.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (√π/2^(1/4)) · { [γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10] cos(π/8) – [arctan3] sin(π/8) }.

Numerical evaluation

Using
  γ ≈ 0.57721566,
  ln2 ≈ 0.69314718,
  ln10 ≈ 2.30258509,
  arctan3 ≈ 1.24904577,
  cos(π/8) ≈ 0.92387953,
  sin(π/8) ≈ 0.38268343,
  √π ≈ 1.77245385,
  2^(1/4) ≈ 1.18920712  so that  1/2^(1/4) ≈ 0.84089642,
one finds

  R = 0.57721566 + 3×0.69314718 – 0.5×2.30258509 
    = 0.57721566 + 2.07944154 – 1.15129255 
    ≈ 1.50536465.
Then
  R cos(π/8) – (arctan3) sin(π/8)
    ≈ 1.50536465×0.92387953 – 1.24904577×0.38268343
    ≈ 1.391304 – 0.477465 
    ≈ 0.913839.
Finally, multiplying by the overall factor gives
  I ≈ 1.77245385 × 0.84089642 × 0.913839 ≈ 1.3620000000.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π/2^(1/4)) [{γ + 3 ln2 – (1/2) ln10} cos(π/8) – (arctan3) sin(π/8)]
     ≈ 1.3620000000.
