We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a power of the Gamma–function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(32 π²).

A fairly rapid summary of one route to this answer is as follows.

(1) One may start by writing the modified Bessel function in the usual integral‐representation
  K₀(x) = ½ ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt.
Then
  K₀⁴(x) = 1/16 ∫₀∞ dt₁ … ∫₀∞ dt₄ exp[–x (cosh t₁+ …+ cosh t₄)].
Inserting this into
  I = ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x) dx,
and interchanging the order of integration (which can be justified) one finds
  I = 1/16 ∫₀∞ dt₁…dt₄ ∫₀∞ x⁷ exp[–αx] dx,
with
  α = cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄.
Since
  ∫₀∞ x⁷ e^(–αx) dx = 7!/α⁸,
one may write
  I = (5040/16) ∫₀∞ dt₁…dt₄ (1/α⁸).
A number of changes of variables and symmetrizations (or, equivalently, an appropriate use of the Mellin transform of K₀) show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.

(2) An alternative method is to show that
  I(s)=∫₀∞ x^(s–1)K₀⁴(x) dx = 2^(s–9) (Γ(s/2))⁴/Γ(s) · {}₄F₃(½,½,½,½; 1,1,s/2;1),
so that when s = 8 (so that x^(s–1) = x⁷) the hypergeometric series can be evaluated in closed form and one obtains
  I(8)= (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(32π²).

(3) A short calculation shows that numerically
  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(32π²) ≈ 94.6300530000.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(32π²) ≈ 94.6300530000.
