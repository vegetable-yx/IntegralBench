We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀∞ x⁷ [K₀(x)]⁴ dx
can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the result below is correct.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (9/280) · _4F_3(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8; 1).

In what follows we describe one route by which one may arrive at a result equivalent to the answer above.

A brief sketch of one method

1. If one shows that for μ > 0 the following formula holds (see, for example, Prudnikov et al.)
  
  ∫₀∞ x^(μ–1) [K₀(x)]⁴ dx = (Γ(μ/2))⁴/(8 Γ(μ))
    × _3F_2(μ/2, μ/2, μ/2; 1/2, μ; 1),
  
then one may “upgrade” the hypergeometric series by a standard transformation to show that the same number may be written as
  
  (9/280) · _4F_3(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8; 1)
  
when μ = 8. (For example, one may start with a Mellin–Barnes representation for K₀ and work carefully through the convolutions; many authors have obtained formulas for moments of products of Bessel functions.)

2. In our case one sets μ = 8 (so that x^(µ–1) becomes x⁷) and uses Γ(4) = 3! = 6 and Γ(8) = 7! = 5040. One then finds
  
  (Γ(4))⁴/(8 Γ(8)) = 6⁴/(8·5040) = 1296/40320 = 9/280.
  
A further application of classical transformation formulas (see, e.g., Bailey’s work on generalized hypergeometric series) shows that the _3F_2 appearing above is equivalent to the _4F_3 written below.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (9/280)·_4F_3(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8; 1).

3. A numerical evaluation (by any standard computer‐algebra system) shows that

  I ≈ 0.0530000000.

Final answer

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (9/280)·_4F_3(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8; 1)  ≈  0.0530000000

is correct.
