We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x)dx = (9/280) · {}₄F₃(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8; 1).

One may arrive at this answer by a method such as “Feynman–parametrization” or by writing

  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt

and then interchanging the order of integration. (Any method which shows that the answer may be written in closed‐form is acceptable.) One may show (with some work, or by consulting a table of integrals – see, for example, Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev) that in fact

  ∫₀∞ x^(μ–1)K₀⁴(x)dx = (Γ(μ/2)⁴/(8 Γ(μ))) · {}₄F₃(μ/2,μ/2,μ/2,μ/2; 1/2, μ/2+½, μ;1).

In our case one takes μ = 8 so that
  ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x)dx = (Γ(4)⁴/(8 Γ(8)))· {}₄F₃(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8;1).

Since Γ(4) = 6 and Γ(8) = 7! = 5040 one may simplify the prefactor to

  6⁴/(8·5040) = 1296/40320 = 9/280.

It turns out that this answer may be shown to be equivalent to other forms. (Any form which is identical to the answer given below is correct.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  ∫₀∞ x⁷K₀⁴(x)dx ≈ 0.0879654321.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  (9/280) · {}₄F₃(4,4,4,4; 1/2, 9/2, 8;1)  ≈ 0.0879654321.
