We start with the known antiderivative:
  ∫ sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C.
Then the definite integral is
  ∫[π/6]^[π/3] sec(x) dx = ln|sec(π/3) + tan(π/3)| − ln|sec(π/6) + tan(π/6)|.
At x = π/3, cos(π/3) = 1/2 so sec(π/3) = 2 and sin(π/3) = √3/2 so tan(π/3) = √3. Thus,
  sec(π/3) + tan(π/3) = 2 + √3.
At x = π/6, cos(π/6) = √3/2 so sec(π/6) = 2/√3 and sin(π/6) = 1/2 so tan(π/6) = 1/√3. Then,
  sec(π/6) + tan(π/6) = 2/√3 + 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3.
Thus the definite integral becomes
  ln(2 + √3) − ln(√3) = ln((2 + √3)/√3).

For the numerical approximation:
• First compute √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772.
• Then (2 + √3) ≈ 3.7320508075688772.
• Now, (2 + √3)/√3 ≈ 3.7320508075688772 / 1.7320508075688772 ≈ 2.1547005383792515.
• Finally, ln(2.1547005383792515) ≈ 0.7671952248.
