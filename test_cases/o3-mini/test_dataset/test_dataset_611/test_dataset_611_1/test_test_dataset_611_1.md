We start with the antiderivative of sec x:

  ∫ sec x dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + C.

Now, evaluate from x = π/6 to x = π/3:

1. For x = π/3:
  sec(π/3) = 1/cos(π/3) = 1/(1/2) = 2,
  tan(π/3) = √3.
  Thus, sec(π/3) + tan(π/3) = 2 + √3.

2. For x = π/6:
  sec(π/6) = 1/cos(π/6) = 1/(√3/2) = 2/√3,
  tan(π/6) = 1/√3.
  Thus, sec(π/6) + tan(π/6) = 2/√3 + 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3.

Hence, the definite integral is

  ∫(π/6)^(π/3) sec x dx = ln|2 + √3| − ln|√3|
             = ln((2 + √3)/√3).

For a numerical approximation, first note that
  (2 + √3)/√3 ≈ (2 + 1.7320508075688772)/1.7320508075688772 ≈ 3.7320508075688772/1.7320508075688772 ≈ 2.1547005384.
Then, ln(2.1547005384) ≈ 0.7675283643.

Thus, the final answers are as follows:

{"answer": "\\ln\\left(\\frac{2+\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)", "numerical_answer": "0.7675283643"}
