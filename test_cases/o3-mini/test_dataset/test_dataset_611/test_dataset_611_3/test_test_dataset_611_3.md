To begin, recall that the antiderivative of sec x is

  ∫ sec x dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + C.

Thus, we have

  ∫₍π/6₎^(π/3) sec x dx = ln|sec x + tan x|  evaluated from x = π/6 to x = π/3.

Step 1. Evaluate at the upper limit (x = π/3):

 • cos(π/3) = 1/2, so sec(π/3) = 2.
 • sin(π/3) = √3/2, hence tan(π/3) = (sin π/3)/(cos π/3) = (√3/2)/(1/2) = √3.

Thus, sec(π/3) + tan(π/3) = 2 + √3.

Step 2. Evaluate at the lower limit (x = π/6):

 • cos(π/6) = √3/2, so sec(π/6) = 2/√3.
 • sin(π/6) = 1/2, hence tan(π/6) = (1/2)/(√3/2) = 1/√3.

Thus, sec(π/6) + tan(π/6) = 2/√3 + 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3.

Step 3. Substitute these into the antiderivative:

  ∫₍π/6₎^(π/3) sec x dx = ln(2 + √3) – ln(√3)
         = ln((2 + √3)/√3).

Step 4. For the numerical approximation, calculate:

 • (2 + √3)/√3 ≈ (2 + 1.7320508075688772) / 1.7320508075688772
         = 3.7320508075688772 / 1.7320508075688772 ≈ 2.1547005384.
 • Hence, ln(2.1547005384) ≈ 0.7676977782.

Thus, the exact answer is ln((2+√3)/√3) and the numerical approximation is approximately 0.7676977782.
