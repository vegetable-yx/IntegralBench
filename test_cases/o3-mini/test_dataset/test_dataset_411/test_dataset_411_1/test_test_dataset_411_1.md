We start with the integral

  I = ∫[2/π, ∞] (sin(1/x) / x²) dx.

Step 1. Use the substitution u = 1/x. Then, differentiate:
  du/dx = –1/x² ⟹ du = –(1/x²) dx ⟹ dx = –x² du.

Step 2. Substitute into the integral. Notice that the factor 1/x² in the integrand cancels with the x² from dx:
  sin(1/x)/x² dx = sin(u)/x² (–x² du) = – sin(u) du.

Step 3. Change the limits. When x = 2/π, then u = 1/(2/π) = π/2. When x = ∞, then u = 1/∞ = 0.

Step 4. Rewrite the integral with the new variable u:
  I = ∫[x=2/π to x=∞] (sin(1/x)/x² dx) = – ∫[u=π/2 to u=0] sin(u) du.
Reverse the limits to remove the minus sign:
  I = ∫[u=0 to u=π/2] sin(u) du.

Step 5. Compute the new integral:
  ∫ sin(u) du = –cos(u).
Evaluating from 0 to π/2:
  I = [–cos(u)] from 0 to π/2 = [–cos(π/2)] – [–cos(0)] = (0) + cos(0) = 1.

Step 6. Numerical approximation:
  The result is 1, and to 10 decimal places it is 1.0000000000.
