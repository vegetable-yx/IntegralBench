We start with the integral

  I = ∫ from x = 2/π to x = ∞ [sin(1/x) / x²] dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution:
  Let u = 1/x.
Then,
  du/dx = –1/x² ⇒ du = –(1/x²) dx ⇒ dx = –x² du.
Also note that since u = 1/x, we have sin(1/x) = sin(u) and x² in the integrand cancels with the one in dx:
  sin(1/x) / x² dx = sin(u) / x² (–x² du) = – sin(u) du.

Step 2. Change the limits of integration:
When x = 2/π  ⇒ u = 1/(2/π) = π/2,
When x = ∞  ⇒ u = 1/∞ = 0.
Thus, the integral becomes:
  I = – ∫ from u = π/2 to u = 0 sin(u) du.

Step 3. Reverse the limits and remove the negative sign:
  I = ∫ from u = 0 to u = π/2 sin(u) du.

Step 4. Evaluate the integral:
  ∫ sin(u) du = –cos(u) + C.
So,
  I = [ –cos(u) ] from u = 0 to u = π/2 = [ –cos(π/2) + cos(0) ] = [ –0 + 1 ] = 1.

Thus, the integral evaluates exactly to 1. 

Step 5. The numerical approximation of 1 is simply 1.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
