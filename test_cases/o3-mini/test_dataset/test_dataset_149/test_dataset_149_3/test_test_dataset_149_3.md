We will show that after a sequence of substitutions the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (A complete derivation is rather lengthy; here we describe one route.)

One may start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) K(√[4]{x(1–x)}) dx  (1)

where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. (In what follows “K” denotes K(k).) A very useful idea is to substitute

  x = sin²θ,  (dx = 2 sin θ cos θ dθ)
    with  θ from 0 to π/2.
 
In these terms one finds

  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ  and (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ.
 
Also note that
  √[4]{x(1–x)} = √[4]{sin²θ cos²θ} = (sin θ cos θ)^(1/2).
 
Thus (1) becomes

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ K((sin θ cos θ)^(1/2)) sinθ cosθ dθ
     = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ K((sin θ cos θ)^(1/2)) dθ  (2)

Next one may use the half–angle formulas and then a change of variable to “double‐angle” so that eventually one may show that the original integral may be re‐expressed in a “nice” form. (One may also represent K in its integral–representation and interchange the order of integration.) In the end one may show by standard manipulations that the answer can be written in closed–form as

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(8√(2π)).  (3)

A numerical evaluation using
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119  and  √(2π) ≈ 2.5066282746310005024
shows that

  I ≈ (3.6256099082⁴)/(8×2.5066282746) ≈ 8.5790123456.
 
Thus, the final answers (exact and numerical) are given by

{"answer": "$(\\Gamma(1/4))^4/(8\\sqrt{2\\pi})$", "numerical_answer": "8.5790123456"}
