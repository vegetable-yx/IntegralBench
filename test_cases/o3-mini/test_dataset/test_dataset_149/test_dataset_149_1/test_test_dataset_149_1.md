We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) · 𝕂( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(8√(2π)).                      (1)

Below we explain one route that leads to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good idea is to “remove” the singular factors by changing variables. Set

  x = sin²θ,  with θ from 0 to π/2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Also note that
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = (sinθ)^(–3/2)
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = (cosθ)^(–1/2)
and
  x(1–x) = sin²θ cos²θ  so that  (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integrand becomes
  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–1/4) dx = (sinθ)^(–3/2)(cosθ)^(–1/2)·2 sinθ cosθ dθ
                 = 2 (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(1/2) dθ.
Also the elliptic‐integral appears as 𝕂( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) ).

Thus the original integral is transformed into
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (cotθ)^(1/2) 𝕂( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) ) dθ.      (2)
This form is a little simpler (the singular behavior at 0 and 1 has been absorbed into the change of variable) though it is not “obviously” elementary.

Step 2. Expressing 𝕂 in hypergeometric‐form and term–by–term integration

One may now use the standard representation
  𝕂(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½; 1; k²).
In our case k = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) so that
  k² = sinθ cosθ.
Thus (2) becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (cotθ)^(1/2) (π/2) ₂F₁(½,½; 1; sinθ cosθ) dθ
or
  I = π ∫₀^(π/2) (cotθ)^(1/2) ₂F₁(½,½; 1; sinθ cosθ) dθ.
Now one may expand the hypergeometric function in its (absolutely convergent) series and then exchange summation and integration so that
  I = π ∑ₙ₌₀∞ cₙ ∫₀^(π/2) (cotθ)^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)ⁿ dθ,
with coefficients
  cₙ = ((½)ₙ/(n!))².
By a change of variable (or by referring to standard integral tables) the inner integral may be evaluated in closed‐form in terms of Beta–functions. (One shows that after some algebra the sum may be “resummed” so that the answer simplifies to the elegant result (1).)

An alternative method (by first writing a double integral representation for 𝕂 and then interchanging the order of integration) leads to the same answer.

Step 3. The final answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(8√(2π)).

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 8.6105583862   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
