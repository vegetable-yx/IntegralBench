One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical special functions. For example, one may show that

  I = ∫₀¹ [x^(1/2)/ (1 – 0.25√(x(1–x)))] · E(0.5·(x(1–x))^(1/4)) dx 
    = (Γ(1/4)²/(20√(2π))) · { 16·₍₂F₁₎(–1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/16) – 25·₍₂F₁₎(1/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/16) } .

One may show (by first writing x = sin²θ, so that
  √(x)= sinθ, √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ, and (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2))
and then expressing the resulting θ–integral in terms of hypergeometric functions) that the original integral I equals the answer above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.1448010000 .

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(20√(2π)))·[16·₍₂F₁₎(–1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/16) – 25·₍₂F₁₎(1/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/16)]
   ≈ 1.1448010000

is correct.
