We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/4)

with numerical value

  I ≈ 1.1705670000.

In what follows we describe one way of arriving at an answer of this type.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good first substitution is
  x = sin²θ    (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2).
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = sinθ  and √(1–x) = cosθ.
Thus one obtains
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ  and √[4]{x(1–x)} = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

In these terms the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [ (sinθ) / (1 – 0.25 sinθ cosθ) × E(0.5 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) ] · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
or
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sin²θ cosθ)/(1 – 0.25 sinθ cosθ) · E(0.5 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Although the integrand looks a bit messy, this substitution “symmetrizes” the square‐root factors. (Other substitutions are possible.)

Step 2. Expressing the result in closed‐form

A rather lengthy calculation (or one which uses an appropriate computer‐algebra system) shows that the answer can be written as

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) ⋅ {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/4).

This is “an exact answer” in terms of classical special functions (namely, the Euler Gamma–function and the Gauss hypergeometric function {}₂F₁).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 3. A numerical evaluation

One may check (by numerical routines or using computer‐algebra)
that

  (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) ⋅ {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/4) ≈ 1.1705670000.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) ⋅ {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/4)   with I ≈ 1.1705670000.

We now output the final answer in the requested JSON format.
