We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/4)[1 – J₀(2) + J₀(2) H₁(2) – J₁(2) H₀(2)],

where Jₙ is the Bessel function of order n and Hₙ is the (Struve) function of order n. (It can be proved that this answer is equivalent to other forms that one may obtain.) One may show (by several methods – for example, by “differentiating under the integral sign” or by a “double integration‐by‐parts” technique) that

  ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx = ¼ [1 – J₀(2) + J₀(2) H₁(2) – J₁(2) H₀(2)].

A short outline of one derivation is as follows:

1. Write the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx.
2. Use the fact that
  d/dx J₀(2x) = –2J₁(2x)
to write
  J₁(2x) dx = –½ d[J₀(2x)].
3. Thus
  I = –½ ∫₀¹ x arccos x d[J₀(2x)].
4. Integrate by parts (taking u = arccos x so that du = –dx/√(1–x²) and “dv” = x d[J₀(2x)]) and then massage the answer so that the “other integral” (after a change of variable x = cosθ) may be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel and Struve functions.
5. One convenient answer is the one given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.3014000000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
