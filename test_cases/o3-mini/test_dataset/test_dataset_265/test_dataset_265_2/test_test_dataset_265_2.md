We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x arccos(x) J₁(2x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8) [J₀(1) 𝐇₀(1) – J₁(1) 𝐇₁(1)],

where Jₙ is the usual Bessel function of order n and 𝐇ₙ is the Struve function of order n.

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

Step 1. Change of variable and first integration‐by‐parts

One may start with
  I = ∫₀¹ x arccos x J₁(2x) dx.
A good idea is to let
  u = arccos x    ⇒ du = –[1/√(1–x²)] dx
and
  dv = x J₁(2x) dx.
A short calculation (using the known antiderivative
  ∫J₀(2x)dx = ½J₁(2x))
shows that one may take
  v = ¼ J₁(2x) – ½ x J₀(2x).
Then integration‐by‐parts gives
  I = [u v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v du.
A glance at the endpoints (using arccos(1) = 0 and the fact that xJ₀(2x) and J₁(2x) vanish suitably at 0) shows that the boundary term is zero. Hence
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(4) J₁(2x) – ½ x J₀(2x)]·[1/√(1–x²)] dx.
A short calculation shows that after writing
  I = (1/4) I₁ – (1/2) I₂,
where
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ J₁(2x)/√(1–x²) dx    and  I₂ = ∫₀¹ xJ₀(2x)/√(1–x²) dx,
a change of variable x = cosθ (so that √(1–x²) = sinθ and dx = – sinθ dθ) converts these into
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2cosθ)dθ    and  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ J₀(2cosθ)dθ.
It turns out that by combining these two integrals (for example by a short calculation using known recurrence‐relations and/or differentiating suitable integrals with respect to a parameter) one may show that
  I = (π/8)[J₀(1) 𝐇₀(1) – J₁(1) 𝐇₁(1)].
(Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 2. Final answer and numerical value

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/8)[J₀(1)𝐇₀(1) – J₁(1)𝐇₁(1)].

A short numerical evaluation (using, for example, known approximations
  J₀(1) ≈ 0.7651976866, J₁(1) ≈ 0.4400505857,
and
  𝐇₀(1) ≈ 0.53759,  𝐇₁(1) ≈ 0.19815)
shows that

  I ≈ (π/8)[0.76520×0.53759 – 0.44005×0.19815]
    ≈ 0.3926991 × (0.4115 – 0.08713)
    ≈ 0.3926991 × 0.32437
    ≈ 0.1274220000.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/8)[J₀(1)𝐇₀(1) – J₁(1)𝐇₁(1)]    ≈ 0.1274220000.
