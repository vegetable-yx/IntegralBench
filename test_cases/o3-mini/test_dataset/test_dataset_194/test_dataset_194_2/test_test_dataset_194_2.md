One acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5x)·arccos x dx
   = (π/12)·(π – 6 + √3·ln[(√3+1)/(√3–1])
     + (1/3)·[Li₂(½ – (√3)/2) – Li₂(½ + (√3)/2)] .

It can be shown (by, for example, differentiating with respect to a parameter and then interchanging summation and integration) that the antiderivative can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A completely acceptable answer is

    
  I = (π/12)·(π – 6 + √3·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))
     + (1/3)·[Li₂(½ – (√3)/2) – Li₂(½ + (√3)/2)] .

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1949999898 .

The final answer is then given in JSON exactly as follows:

{"answer": "\\displaystyle \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\Bigl(\\pi-6+\\sqrt{3}\\ln\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{\\sqrt{3}-1}\\Bigr)+\\frac{1}{3}\\Bigl[\\operatorname{Li}_2\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\Bigr)-\\operatorname{Li}_2\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\Bigr)\\Bigr]", "numerical_answer": "0.1949999898"}

Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.
