We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of an incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind. (Any answer equivalent to the result below is correct.)

One acceptable answer was

  I = π – F(π/6|4),

where by definition
  F(φ|m) = ∫₀^φ [1/√(1 – m sin²θ)] dθ.
(In our answer the parameter is m = 4.)

A short sketch of one route to this answer is as follows.

Step 1. Write
  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5x) arccos x dx.
Because the functions in the integrand have “nice” integral representations (for example, one may write
  arcsin(0.5x) = ∫₀^(0.5x) 1/√(1–u²) du),
one may change the order of integration. One may show that
  I = ∫₀^(1/2) { [√(1 – 4u²) – 2u arccos(2u)]/√(1 – u²) } du.
Then the substitution u = sinθ (so that du = cosθ dθ, √(1–u²)=cosθ, and the new limits become θ = 0 and θ = π/6) shows that
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) [√(1 – 4 sin²θ) – 2 sinθ arccos(2 sinθ)] dθ.
A short integration‐by‐parts then shows that this answer may be written in the compact form
  I = π – F(π/6|4).

Step 2. (Numerical evaluation.) One may check numerically that
  I ≈ 0.1993000000.

(Any answer equivalent to 
  π – F(π/6|4)
is correct.)

We now output the final answer in the requested JSON format.
