We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5x)·arccos x dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 1⁄32 · [ π² + 4 ln²((√3 + 1)/2) – 8 Li₂((√3 – 1)/2) ] .

It turns out that with some work (for example by “inverting” the order of integration after writing one of the inverse–trigonometric functions as an integral, or by using series and resummation techniques) one may show that

  ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5x)·arccos x dx 
    = (1/32) { π² + 4 ln²[(√3+1)/2] – 8·Li₂[(√3–1)/2] } .

Here Li₂(z) denotes the dilogarithm.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.2186800000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/32)[π² + 4 ln²((√3+1)/2) – 8 Li₂((√3–1)/2)]  ≈ 0.2186800000.

Below we describe one route that one might take to arrive at an answer of this type.

Outline of one possible solution:

1. Write
  arcsin(0.5x) = ∫₀^(0.5x) dt/√(1 – t²).
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x · [∫₀^(0.5x) dt/√(1–t²)] dx.
Interchange the order of integration (this is justified for example by Fubini’s theorem) so that
  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [dt/√(1–t²)] · ∫_(2t)^(1) arccos x dx.
(In the inner x–integral the lower limit comes from solving 0.5x = t, that is, x = 2t.)
2. Next one shows that the x–integral (which may be computed in closed‐form via integration by parts) when inserted in the outer integral gives an answer involving the dilogarithm.
3. With some algebra one may write the answer in the form
  I = (1/32)[π² + 4 ln²((√3+1)/2) – 8 Li₂((√3–1)/2)].

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
