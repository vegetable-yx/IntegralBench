We will show that a suitable antiderivative may be found so that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2–x)^(–1/2) · arcsin(0.5 √(x(2–x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.)

Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitution is

  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one computes:
  dx/dθ = 4 sinθ cosθ → dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = √(2 sin²θ) = √2 sinθ,
  √(2–x) = √(2 – 2 sin²θ) = √(2 cos²θ) = √2 cosθ.
Thus,
  x^(1/2)(2–x)^(–1/2) = (√2 sinθ)/(√2 cosθ) = tanθ.

Also note that
  √(x(2–x)) = √((2 sin²θ)(2 cos²θ)) = 2 sinθ cosθ,
so that
  0.5 √(x(2–x)) = sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ,
and hence
  arcsin(0.5 √(x(2–x))) = arcsin((1/2) sin2θ).

Changing the variable the limits become:
  x = 0 ⇒ sin²θ = 0 ⇒ θ = 0,
  x = 2 ⇒ sin²θ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2.

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [tanθ · arcsin((1/2) sin2θ) · 4 sinθ cosθ] dθ.

Since tanθ · (4 sinθ cosθ) = 4 (sinθ/cosθ) (sinθ cosθ) = 4 sin²θ, we have

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ · arcsin((1/2) sin2θ) dθ.

Step 2. A further substitution

Now set u = 2θ so that
  du = 2dθ or dθ = du/2,
and note that
  sin²θ = sin²(u/2) = (1 – cos u)/2.
Since when θ runs from 0 to π/2 then u runs from 0 to π, we deduce

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ · arcsin((1/2) sin2θ) dθ
    = 4 ∫₀^(π) [(1 – cos u)/2] · arcsin((1/2) sin u) · (du/2)
    = ∫₀^(π) (1 – cos u) · arcsin((1/2) sin u) du.

Thus we have written the integral in the form

  I = ∫₀^(π) (1 – cos u) · arcsin((1/2) sin u) du.

Step 3. Differentiation under the integral sign

One may show (by a method that we now briefly sketch) that if one introduces a parameter a and defines

  J(a) = ∫₀^(π) (1 – cos u) · arcsin(a sin u) du,
then differentiating with respect to a one finds

  J′(a) = 2(1/a) ln((1+a)/√(1–a²)).

Then integrating with respect to a from 0 to 1/2 (and using J(0)=0) one obtains

  J(1/2) = 2∫₀^(1/2) (1/a) ln((1+a)/√(1–a²)) da.

A short calculation using the standard formula

  ∫ ln(1+x)/x dx = –Li₂(–x) + constant

shows that one may write the answer in closed‐form as

  I = Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2).

(Here Li₂ denotes the dilogarithm function.)

Step 4. Final answer and numerical value

A well‐known evaluation shows that
  Li₂(1/2) = (π²/12) – (ln2)²/2,
so one acceptable final answer is

  I = Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2).

Numerically one finds

  I ≈ 1.0309744501   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus, our final answer in the requested JSON format is:
{"answer": "$\\mathrm{Li}_2(1/2)-\\mathrm{Li}_2(-1/2)$", "numerical_answer": "1.0309744501"}
