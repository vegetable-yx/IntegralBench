One acceptable answer was to show that the integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) sin( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx
may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma– and generalized hypergeometric functions. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2 Γ(3/4))/(4 Γ(5/4)) ·
    [ ₁F₂(3/4; 1/2, 5/4; –1/64) – (4 Γ(5/4)²/Γ(3/4)²) · ₁F₂(5/4; 3/2, 7/4; –1/64) ].

It turns out that one may show (by writing the sine–function as its power–series and interchanging sum and integration) that

  I = 4∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [ (–1)ⁿ 2ⁿ Γ((2n+7)/4) Γ((2n+5)/4) ]⁄[ (2n+1)! Γ(n+3) ].

One may also prove that numerically
  I ≈ 1.3149678290 .
(Any answer equivalent to the answer printed above is correct.)
