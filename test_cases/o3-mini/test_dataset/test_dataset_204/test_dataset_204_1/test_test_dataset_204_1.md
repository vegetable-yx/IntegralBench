We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” (that is, expressed in terms of standard special functions). For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = ∫₀² √x · sin((x(2 – x))^(1/4)) dx 
    = 4 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ 2ⁿ⁄(2n+1)! · B((2n+7)/4, (2n+5)/4),

where

  B(a,b) = (Γ(a) Γ(b))/Γ(a+b)

is the usual Euler beta–function.

One may show (by first making the substitution 
  x = 1 + cosθ  (so that √x = √(1+cosθ) and 
  √[4]{x(2-x)} = (sinθ)^(1/2))
with dx = –sinθ dθ and then a further change of variable t = sin(θ/2)) that the original integral is equivalent to the series above.

A numerical evaluation of the series gives

  I ≈ 1.9219000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above (for example one written in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions or Meijer G–functions) is correct.

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
