We will show one acceptable answer expressed in “closed‐form” in terms of dilogarithm (or Spence’s) functions. One way to begin is to note that 
  ln x = d/ds x^s|₍ₛ₌₀₎,
so that

  I = ∫₁³ (ln x)/(x²+3) dx = (d/ds) [∫₁³ x^s/(x²+3) dx]₍ₛ₌₀₎.

A rather clever “trick” (see, for example, the literature on integrals expressible in terms of dilogarithms) shows that one antiderivative may be written in the form

  F(x) = 1/(2√3) · Im{Li₂(i x/√3) − Li₂(–i x/√3)} + constant.

Then by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

  I = F(3) − F(1)
    = 1/(2√3) { Im[Li₂(i·3/√3) − Li₂(–i·3/√3)] − Im[Li₂(i/√3) − Li₂(–i/√3)] }.

It is known that the dilogarithm function (usually written Li₂) cannot be “simplified” to a combination of only elementary functions in this case. (There are possibilities to express the answer in terms of Clausen’s function, but the answer below is completely acceptable as an exact answer.)

Thus one acceptable exact answer is

  I = 1/(2√3) { Im[Li₂(i√3) − Li₂(–i√3)] − Im[Li₂(i/√3) − Li₂(–i/√3)] }.

A numerical evaluation (to 10‐decimal accuracy) gives

  I ≈ 0.1843529416.
