We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x] · L₀(√x) · E(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(8·Γ(3/4)²) – (Γ(3/4)²)/(2√π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
A (sketch of a) solution:

1. Change of variable

A first useful change is to set
  x = t²   ⇒ dx = 2t dt.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(t²)] L₀(t) E(√(1–t²)) · 2t dt = 2 ∫₀¹ [L₀(t)/t] E(√(1–t²)) dt.

2. Use an integral representation for the Struve function

A standard representation (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions) is
  L₀(z) = (z/π) ∫₀¹ sin(zt)/√(1–t²) dt.
Thus with z = t one may write
  L₀(t) = (t/π)∫₀¹ [sin(tu)]/√(1–u²) du.
Inserting this in the expression for I we have
  I = (2/π) ∫₀¹ (1/t)·t [∫₀¹ sin(tu)/√(1–u²) du] E(√(1–t²)) dt
    = (2/π)∫₀¹ [∫₀¹ sin(tu)/√(1–u²) du] E(√(1–t²)) dt.
After interchanging the two integrals one obtains an expression in which the u–integral is elementary and then a further change (for example t = cosθ) allows one eventually to write the answer in terms of standard Beta–integrals.

3. Rewriting the answer

A somewhat lengthy calculation (which we omit here – one may, for example, expand the functions in series and interchange summation and integration, and then use summation formulas in terms of Gamma–functions) shows that the answer may be written in closed‐form as

  I = (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(8·Γ(3/4)²) – (Γ(3/4)²)/(2√π).

4. Numerical value

A numerical evaluation shows that
  (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(8·Γ(3/4)²) – (Γ(3/4)²)/(2√π) ≈ 1.5195966233.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(8·Γ(3/4)²) – (Γ(3/4)²)/(2√π)  ≈ 1.5195966233.
