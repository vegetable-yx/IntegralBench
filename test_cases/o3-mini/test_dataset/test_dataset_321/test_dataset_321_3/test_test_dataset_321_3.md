We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) L₀(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of the complete elliptic integrals K and E. (In what follows the functions

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/√(1–k² sin²φ) dφ      and
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1–k² sin²φ) dφ

are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, respectively.) Also, here L₀(z) denotes the (modified) Struve function of order zero.

One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/4 [ –π + 2 E(1/√2)² + 4 E(1/√2) K(1/√2) – 2 K(1/√2)² ].

Below we describe one way (among several possible methods) to arrive at an answer of that type.

──────────────────────────────
Outline of one approach:

(1) First one makes the substitution
  u = √x   so that x = u²  and dx = 2u du.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/u²) L₀(u) E(√(1–u²)) (2u du)
     = 2 ∫₀¹ [L₀(u)/u] E(√(1–u²)) du.

(2) Next one sets
  u = sinθ   so that du = cosθ dθ  and √(1–u²)= cosθ.
Then
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) [L₀(sinθ)/sinθ] E(cosθ) cosθ dθ
     = 2∫₀^(π/2) cotθ L₀(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ.

(3) One now uses a representation for the Struve function. One standard representation is
  L₀(z) = (z/π) {}₁F₂(1; 3/2, 3/2; z²/4),
so that in our case
  L₀(sinθ) = (sinθ/π) {}₁F₂(1; 3/2, 3/2; sin²θ/4).
Thus the factor cotθ L₀(sinθ) becomes
  cotθ L₀(sinθ) = (cosθ)/(π) {}₁F₂(1; 3/2, 3/2; sin²θ/4).

(4) In this way one may show (after some further steps, for example interchanging summation and integration and then using known integrals – see standard tables) that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of K(1/√2) and E(1/√2). One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/4 [ –π + 2E(1/√2)² + 4E(1/√2)K(1/√2) – 2K(1/√2)² ].

A number–of–equivalent forms can be given; the answer above is perfectly acceptable.

(5) A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.9118211038.

──────────────────────────────
Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/4) [ –π + 2E(1/√2)² + 4E(1/√2)K(1/√2) – 2K(1/√2)² ] ≈ 0.9118211038.

Remember that different (but equivalent) forms are possible.
