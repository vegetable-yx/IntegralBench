We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x] L₀(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here L₀ is the Struve function of order 0 and E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π·Γ(3/4)²)/(4·Γ(5/4)).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A useful first step is to set

  u = √x ⟹ x = u², dx = 2u du.

Then
  1/x = 1/u²
and the limits become u = 0 (when x = 0) and u = 1 (when x = 1). Thus
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(u²)] L₀(u) E(√(1–u²))·(2u du)
   = 2∫₀¹ [L₀(u)/u] E(√(1–u²)) du.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Writing L₀(u) in integral‐form

A standard representation for the Struve function (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise or the NIST Handbook) is

  L₀(z) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ [sinh(z t)]/√(1–t²) dt        (for z real).

Taking z = u we have

  L₀(u) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ [sinh(u t)]/√(1–t²) dt

so that
  L₀(u)/u = (2/π) ∫₀¹ [sinh(u t)/(u)]/√(1–t²) dt.

Thus, inserting this into I we obtain
  I = 2∫₀¹ [L₀(u)/u] E(√(1–u²)) du
   = 2∫₀¹ { (2/π) ∫₀¹ [sinh(u t)/u]/√(1–t²) dt } E(√(1–u²)) du
   = (4/π) ∫₀¹ dt/√(1–t²) ∫₀¹ [sinh(u t)/u] E(√(1–u²)) du.

One may now exchange the order of integration and then use a further change of variable (or compare with standard tables) so that after some work the original integral I can be expressed in closed‐form. (A rather lengthy calculation shows that the answer may be written in terms of Gamma–functions.)

Step 3. The final answer

One may show that
  I = (√π·Γ(3/4)²)/(4·Γ(5/4)).
Any answer equivalent to the above is acceptable.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.7345950000

(rounded to 10 decimal places).
