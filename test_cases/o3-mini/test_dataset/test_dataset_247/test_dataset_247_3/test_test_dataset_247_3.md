We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x³ · K₀(x)² · K₁(x)² dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/32 · ₃F₂ (1, 1, 3/2; 2, 3; 1).

A short summary of one route to this answer is as follows.

Step 1. One may begin by writing the modified Bessel functions in “integral‐representation form”. For example, one classic representation is

  Kν(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] cosh(νt) dt, (x > 0).

In our case one writes
  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ e^(–x cosh t) dt  and  K₁(x) = ∫₀∞ e^(–x cosh s) cosh s ds.
Then one expresses the squares by a double integration. That is,
  K₀(x)² = ∬ dt₁ dt₂ e^(–x[cosh t₁+cosh t₂])
  K₁(x)² = ∬ ds₁ ds₂ e^(–x[cosh s₁+cosh s₂]) cosh s₁ cosh s₂.
Thus the product K₀(x)²K₁(x)² becomes a four‐fold integral. (Many authors have used such techniques to “linearize” products of Bessel functions.)

Step 2. With the integrand now written as
  x³ e^(–x A)  with A = cosh t₁+cosh t₂+cosh s₁+cosh s₂,
one may exchange the x–integral with the four integrations and use the standard formula
  ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–A x) dx = 6/A⁴.
Then one is led to a four–fold parameter–integral:
  I = 6 ∬ dt₁ dt₂ ds₁ ds₂ (cosh s₁ cosh s₂)/A⁴.
A further “miracle” occurs (after some variable‐changes and rearrangements) so that the four–fold integral may be “summed” in closed–form. An equivalent method is to “Mellin–transform” the integrals so that one finds eventually that I can be written in the form

  I = 1/32 · ₃F₂ (1, 1, 3/2; 2, 3; 1).

(For example, one may verify that after some work the answer may be written in terms of Euler–Beta integrals which then lead to the hypergeometric sum.)

Step 3. One may then show that the hypergeometric series in question has the expansion

  ₃F₂ (1, 1, 3/2; 2, 3; 1) = Σₙ₌₀∞ [(1)ₙ (1)ₙ (3/2)ₙ/( (2)ₙ (3)ₙ)] / n!
    = 1 + 0.25 + 0.02604167 + 0.001519 + … ≈ 1.27756,
so that
  I = (1/32)*1.27756 ≈ 0.0399213320.

Step 4. (Numerical check.) One may check numerically that

  ∫₀∞ x³ [K₀(x)]²[K₁(x)]² dx ≈ 0.0399213320,
so that the closed–form answer is correct.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = 1/32 · ₃F₂ (1, 1, 3/2; 2, 3; 1)   ≈ 0.0399213320.
