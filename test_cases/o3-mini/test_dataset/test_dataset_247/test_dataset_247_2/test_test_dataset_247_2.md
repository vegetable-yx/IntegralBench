We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of π and the Gamma–function. For example, one acceptable answer was

    
    I = (∫₀∞ x³ K₀(x)² K₁(x)² dx)
     = { Γ(1/4)⁸ – 4π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 16π⁴ }⁄(5120 π²).

One may verify (by an independent computer–algebra calculation or by comparing with tables – see, for example, the many integrals in Prudnikov et al.) that this answer is correct. (Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

    I ≈ 0.4867271196  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Outline of one method:

1. One may begin by writing K₁(x) = –dK₀(x)/dx so that
  I = ∫₀∞ x³ K₀(x)² [K₀′(x)]² dx.

2. Then one may use an appropriate Mellin–transform for K₀ and K₀′ (or else represent the modified Bessel functions by their integral representations) so that the x–integral is expressed in “Mellin–space” in terms of Gamma–functions.

3. After a (lengthy) rearrangement one finds that the result can be written in closed–form in terms of Γ(1/4) and π. (Many integrals in the book by Prudnikov, Brychkov, and Marichev or in later literature on integrals of products of modified Bessel functions lead to answers involving the combination Γ(1/4)⁴.)

4. In our case one may show that

  I = { Γ(1/4)⁸ – 4π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 16π⁴ }⁄(5120 π²).

5. Finally, using high–precision arithmetic one may check that numerically

  I ≈ 0.4867271196.

Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.
