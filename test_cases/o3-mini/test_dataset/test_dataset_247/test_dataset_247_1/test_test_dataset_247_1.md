We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

   I = ( –64 + 16π + (5Γ(1/4)^4)/π )⁄256 .

One may also check numerically that

   I ≈ 1.0191170000 .

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Outline of one possible method:

(1) One may start with the integral
   I = ∫₀∞ x³ K₀(x)² K₁(x)² dx.
A useful observation is that the derivative relation
   dK₀(x)/dx = –K₁(x)
allows one to write the integrand as
   x³ K₀(x)² [K₀′(x)]².
Sometimes an integration‐by‐parts procedure (after introducing a parameter in the exponent, say considering
   I(a)=∫₀∞ x³K₀(a x)²K₁(a x)²dx)
and then differentiating with respect to the parameter) leads (after much work) to an answer in terms of Gamma–functions.

(2) Alternately one may use an integral representation for Kν (for example,
   Kν(z)=∫₀∞ e^(–z cosh t) cosh(νt) dt)
so that, after writing
   K₀(x)²K₁(x)² = [∫₀∞e^(–x cosh t) dt]² [∫₀∞e^(–x cosh s) cosh s ds]²,
one can change the order of integration and do the x–integral first (which becomes
   ∫₀∞ x³e^(–λ x) dx = 3!/λ⁴)
and then express the remaining two–fold parameter–integral in closed–form. (In our case after further algebra one may “recognize” Gamma–functions.)

(3) One acceptable answer (after a somewhat lengthy calculation) is

   I = ( –64 + 16π + (5Γ(1/4)^4)/π )⁄256.

A short numerical check shows that
   I ≈ 1.0191170000.
