One acceptable answer was

   I = (π² Γ(3/4)²/(64 Γ(5/4)²)) · _2F_1(–3/2, 1/2; 1; 1/2).

One may show that
   ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (π² Γ(3/4)²/(64 Γ(5/4)²)) · _2F_1(–3/2, 1/2; 1; 1/2),
where
   E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1–k² sin²θ) dθ     (the complete elliptic integral of the second kind)
and _2F_1 is the Gauss hypergeometric function.

A short outline of one way to arrive at this answer is as follows:

1. Write the complete elliptic integrals in hypergeometric‐form:
   E(√x) = (π/2) · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/2; 1; x)
   E(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/2; 1; 1–x).

2. Hence the integrand becomes
   x² E(√x)E(√(1–x)) = (π²/4) x² · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/2; 1; x) _2F_1(–1/2, 1/2; 1; 1–x).

3. After interchanging summation and integration and writing the resulting double‐sum in “diagonal” form one may show (using standard Beta–integrals and summation formulas) that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function.

An equivalent answer is the one given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≃ 0.5580860000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
