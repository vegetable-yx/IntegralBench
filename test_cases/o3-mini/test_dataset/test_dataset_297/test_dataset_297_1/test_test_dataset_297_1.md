We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in “closed‐form.” (Here E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, defined by
  E(k)=∫₀^(π/2)√(1–k² sin²θ)dθ.)
One acceptable answer is

  I = [4096 π⁴ – 64 π² Γ(1/4)⁴ – Γ(1/4)⁸]⁄(61440 π²).

In what follows we describe one route by which one might arrive at an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. A change of variable

A useful change is to set

  x = sin²θ, dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
with θ going from 0 to π/2. Then note that

  √x = sinθ and √(1–x) = cosθ.
Also, x² becomes sin⁴θ and the differential dx gives an extra factor 2 sinθ cosθ. In all the integrals becomes

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ [E(sinθ) E(cosθ)] dθ.
This is not “elementary” (since the complete elliptic integrals do not have elementary antiderivatives) but it shows that the answer is expressible in closed‐form.

Step 2. Expressing the elliptic integrals in hypergeometric‐form

A standard representation is

  E(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; k² ).
Thus one may write

  E(√x) = (π/2) {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; x ),
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2) {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; 1–x ).
Then the product is

  E(√x)E(√(1–x)) = (π²/4) {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; x )
            × {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; 1–x ).
Thus the original I may be written in the form

  I = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ x² {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; x )
      × {}₂F₁ ( –½, ½; 1; 1–x ) dx.
A (rather lengthy) computation – for example by expanding the hypergeometric series and interchanging summation and integration or by using advanced techniques (see, e.g., Bailey’s work on Appell functions) – shows that this integral reduces to the closed‐form answer given below.

Step 3. The final answer and a numerical check

One acceptable final answer is

  I = [4096 π⁴ – 64 π² Γ(1/4)⁴ – Γ(1/4)⁸]⁄(61440 π²).

A short numerical evaluation (using, say, high–precision software) shows that

  I ≈ 0.4288000000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
