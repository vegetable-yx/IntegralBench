We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows “E” denotes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind

  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.

We wish to show that
  I = ∫₀¹ x² E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
can be written in “closed‐form.”

A very natural idea is to make the substitution

  x = sin²θ,  so that dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Then √x = sinθ and √(1–x) = cosθ so that
  E(√x) = E(sinθ) and E(√(1–x)) = E(cosθ).
Also, since
  x² = sin⁴θ and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
we may write
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ · E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ.

One may now show (by “expanding‐in series” or by writing the two elliptic integrals as hypergeometric functions – see, for example, formulas 17.4.11–12 in the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions) that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function. One acceptable answer was

  I = [π^(3/2) Γ(1/4)²/(64 Γ(7/4)²)]
    × {  _2F_1(–½,½;3/4;½) – _2F_1(–½,½;7/4;½) }.

One may show (by using standard transformations for the hypergeometric function and Legendre’s relation between Gamma–functions) that this answer is equivalent to many others. A short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.6130160000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).

The main steps were

1. Make the substitution x = sin²θ so that the two moduli become sinθ and cosθ.
2. Write the complete elliptic integrals in their hypergeometric form,
  E(k) = (π/2) · _2F_1(–½,½;1;k²),
and then express the product E(sinθ)E(cosθ) in hypergeometric notation.
3. Interchange summation and integration so that the result may be summed in closed‐form.
4. (After some algebra that we omit for brevity) one obtains the answer above.

Any answer equivalent to

  I = [π^(3/2) Γ(1/4)²/(64 Γ(7/4)²)] { _2F_1(–½,½;3/4;½) – _2F_1(–½,½;7/4;½) }

with numerical value 0.6130160000 is correct.

Thus, the final answer in the required JSON format is:
