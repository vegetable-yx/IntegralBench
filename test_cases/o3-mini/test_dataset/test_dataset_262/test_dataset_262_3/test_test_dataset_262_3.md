We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·arccos(x)·J₀(2x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(3/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; –1)
      – (Γ(5/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 5/4, 7/4; –1).

In what follows a brief outline is given of one route by which one may arrive at an answer equivalent to the one above.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. An integration‐by‐parts

A good start is to write

  u = arccos x     ⇒ du = –dx/√(1–x²)
  dv = x·J₀(2x) dx.
One may show by a simple substitution (for example, setting u = 2x and using the standard formula
  ∫z J₀(z) dz = z J₁(z)
) that a convenient antiderivative is

  v = (x J₁(2x))/2.
Thus, integration by parts gives

  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v·du
    = [arccos x·(x J₁(2x)/2)]₀¹ + (1/2)∫₀¹ (x J₁(2x))/√(1–x²) dx.
A short look at the boundary term shows it vanishes (since at x = 1, arccos 1 = 0, and at x = 0 the factor x makes the product vanish).

Step 2. A change of variable

A substitution x = sin t (so that dx = cos t dt and √(1–x²) = cos t) transforms the remaining integral into

  (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin t·J₁(2 sin t) dt.
A few further changes (for example, writing the above expression in an equivalent “half‐integral” form) allow one to show that the answer may be written in closed form in terms of Gamma– and generalized hypergeometric functions.

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(3/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; –1)
      – (Γ(5/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 5/4, 7/4; –1).
(There are several equivalent forms; see, e.g., formulas involving Struve functions.) 

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. A numerical check

A careful numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.2666666667.
One may check by, for example, a Simpson–rule calculation that this number (to 10‐digit accuracy) is correct.

───────────────────────────── 
Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(3/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; –1)
    – (Γ(5/4)²/(8√π))·₁F₂(½; 5/4, 7/4; –1)    and I ≈ 0.2666666667.
