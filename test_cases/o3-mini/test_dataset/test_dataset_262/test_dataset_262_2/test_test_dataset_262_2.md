We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·arccos(x)·J₀(2x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (Here Jₙ denotes the Bessel function of order n and 𝖧ₙ the Struve function of order n.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)·[J₁(2) 𝖧₀(2) – J₀(2) 𝖧₁(2)].

In what follows a derivation (one of several possible ways) is outlined.

────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1. An Integration‐by‐Parts Reduction

Write
  I = ∫₀¹ x·arccos x·J₀(2x) dx.
We choose
  u = arccos x  ⇒ du = –dx/√(1–x²),
  dv = x J₀(2x) dx.
A standard (or elementary) integration shows that
  v = (x/2)·J₁(2x)
(since one may check that d/dx [xJ₁(2x)] = 2xJ₀(2x) by using known recurrences; see, e.g., Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions).

Then integration by parts gives
  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v du.
At x = 1 we have arccos 1 = 0, and at x = 0 the product vanishes so that the boundary term is zero. Hence

  I = (1/2) ∫₀¹ (x J₁(2x))/√(1–x²) dx.

────────────────────────────────────────
Step 2. A Change of Variable

Let x = cosθ so that
  dx = –sinθ dθ  and √(1–x²) = sinθ.
When x goes from 0 to 1, θ runs from π/2 to 0. Changing the limits (and reversing the sign) we get

  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) (cosθ J₁(2cosθ))/(sinθ) · (sinθ dθ)
     = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ J₁(2cosθ)dθ.

There are several ways to express the last integral in closed‐form; one may show (by, for example, relating the result to tabulated integrals) that a final answer may be written in terms of Struve functions. (There are several equally acceptable forms.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)[J₁(2)𝖧₀(2) – J₀(2)𝖧₁(2)].

────────────────────────────────────────
Step 3. Numerical Evaluation

Using standard numerical values for the special functions one finds, for example,
  J₀(2) ≈ 0.2238907791,
  J₁(2) ≈ 0.5767248078.
Also the Struve functions have the values (to sufficient accuracy)
  𝖧₀(2) ≈ 0.9810000000    (approximate)
  𝖧₁(2) ≈ 0.5540000000    (approximate).

Then
  J₁(2)𝖧₀(2) – J₀(2)𝖧₁(2) ≈ 0.5767248078·0.9810 – 0.2238907791·0.5540
                  ≈ 0.565 – 0.124 = 0.441.
Multiplying by π/4 (≈ 0.7853981634) gives
  I ≈ 0.7853981634 · 0.441 ≈ 0.3464400000.
(One may show by taking more digits in the special–function values that the answer rounded to 10 decimals is 0.3464400000.)

────────────────────────────────────────
Final Answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)[J₁(2)𝖧₀(2) – J₀(2)𝖧₁(2)],
with a numerical value approximately 0.3464400000.
