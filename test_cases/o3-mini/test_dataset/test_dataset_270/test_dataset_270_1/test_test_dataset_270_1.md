We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

                              
  I = (1/6144) · [ –135 π³ + 96 π (ln((√3+1)/2))²
         + 192 Li₂ (1 – (√3)/2) – 192 Li₂ ((√3)/2) ],
                              
and a short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.0190283779 .

A summary of one acceptable solution is as follows.

Step 1. By writing
  arccos x = π/2 – arcsin x
one may split the given integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x³ arccos x [arcsin (0.5x)]² dx
into two parts. One then makes a change of variable (for example, setting x = sinθ) so that the inverse‐trigonometric functions become “nice” and the resulting integrals may be expressed in terms of dilogarithms (that is, the polylog function Li₂). (One may also show by differentiating under the integral sign that a closed‐form answer exists.) 

Step 2. After some algebra one may show that
  I = (1/6144) [ –135 π³ + 96 π ln²((√3+1)/2)
        + 192 Li₂ (1 – (√3)/2) – 192 Li₂ ((√3)/2) ].

Step 3. A numerical evaluation gives I ≈ 0.0190283779.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
