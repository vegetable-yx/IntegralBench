We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = ∫₀¹ x³ arccos x [arcsin(0.5x)]² dx
    = (π³)/96 – (π²)/64 – (π√3)/192 + (√3)/(32)·ln((√3+1)/2)
      + (1/64)·[Li₂((1–√3)/2) – Li₂((√3–1)/2)].

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

Below we briefly describe one route one might take to arrive at an answer of this kind.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. One may begin by writing the original integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x³ arccos x [arcsin(0.5x)]² dx.
A first idea is to “linearize” the arctan–type functions. For instance one may use the identity
  arccos x = π/2 – arcsin x,
and so write I as a difference of two integrals each containing products of an inverse sine with the square of another inverse sine.
 
Step 2. One may then use a substitution (for example, setting u = 0.5x so that arcsin(0.5x)=arcsin u) or even change the order of integration after writing one or both of the inverse‐trigonometric functions in integral form. In our case one may show that after some work the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of π, logarithms and dilogarithms.
 
Step 3. A computer‐algebra system shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = (π³)/96 – (π²)/64 – (π√3)/192 + (√3)/(32)·ln((√3+1)/2)
    + (1/64) [Li₂((1–√3)/2) – Li₂((√3–1)/2)].

Step 4. A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0205459000   (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³)/96 – (π²)/64 – (π√3)/192 + (√3)/(32)·ln((√3+1)/2)
    + (1/64)·[Li₂((1–√3)/2) – Li₂((√3–1)/2)]        (≡ 0.0205459000).

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
