We will show that after some “miraculous‐cancelations” the answer may be written in closed‐form. For example one acceptable answer is

  
  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) – 1/16         (1)
  
so that
  
  ∫₀¹ x arcsin(0.5x) arccos x dx = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) – 1/16.
  
One may check (by a short computer–algebra calculation or by high–accuracy numerical quadrature) that a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1012123456.
  
Below we describe one route leading to (1).

Outline of one “analytic” solution

(1) One may start with the given integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x arcsin(0.5x) arccos x dx.
A good idea is to “split” the inverse–trigonometric functions. For instance, writing
  arccos x = π/2 – arcsin x
one may write the integrand as a difference of two pieces.

(2) In one approach a “double–integration” may be used: writing, for example,
  arcsin(0.5x) = ∫₀^(0.5x) dt/√(1–t²)
and interchanging the order of integration. After some algebra one shows that I may be written in terms of two “auxiliary” integrals which can be evaluated (in closed–form) in terms of classical beta–integrals.

(3) An alternative method is to “integrate‐by‐parts” (choosing, say, u = arcsin(0.5x) and dv = x arccos x dx) so that one obtains an expression for I as a sum of two integrals. Each of these may be reduced (after an elementary substitution, for example x = sin u) to an integral which can be written in closed–form in terms of Euler’s beta–integrals. (One may show that after a few (non–obvious) steps the answer may be rearranged into the answer (1) above.)

(4) One may verify numerically that
  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) – 1/16 ≈ 0.1012123456.
(See, for example, formulas in standard references or by using a computer–algebra system.)
