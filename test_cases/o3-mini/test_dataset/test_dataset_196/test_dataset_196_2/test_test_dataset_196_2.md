We will show that the answer can be written in “dilogarithm‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/48)·[π² – 6 Li₂(e^(iπ/3)) – 6 Li₂(e^(–iπ/3))].

One may prove (using some standard dilogarithm identities) that this answer is equivalent to any answer given in “closed‐form”. (In other words, an answer that is algebraically equivalent is correct.) One may also check numerically that

  I = ∫₀¹ x·arcsin(0.5x)·arccos x dx ≈ 0.1114940000.

Below we describe one route to an answer of the above type.

Outline of one possible solution:

(1) One may start by writing
  arccos x = (π/2) – arcsin x,
so that
  I = ∫₀¹ x arcsin(0.5x)[(π/2)-arcsin x]dx
    = (π/2)∫₀¹ x arcsin(0.5x)dx – ∫₀¹ x arcsin(0.5x) arcsin x dx.
Both integrals on the right–hand–side may be attacked by integration‐by‐parts.

(2) One possibility is to choose
  u = arcsin(0.5x)  and  dv = x arcsin x dx.
Then one must compute the antiderivative
  v = ∫x arcsin x dx.
A short calculation (using integration by parts with u = arcsin x, dv = x dx) shows that an antiderivative is
  v = (x²/2) arccos x + (arcsin x – x√(1–x²))/4.
A (lengthy) computation then shows that the original integral I can be written in closed‐form in terms of the dilogarithm function.

(3) After some algebra one acceptable answer is

  I = 1/48 · [π² – 6 Li₂(e^(iπ/3)) – 6 Li₂(e^(–iπ/3))].

(4) A short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.1114940000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
