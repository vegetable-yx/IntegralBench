We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π²/96) + (1/32)·ln²((1+√5)/2).

In other words,
  
  ∫₀¹ x·arcsin(0.5x)·arccos x dx = (π²)/(96) + (1/32)·ln²((1+√5)/2).

A short outline of one route to this answer is as follows.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
1. One may begin by writing
  arccos x = (π/2) – arcsin x,
so that the integrand becomes
  x·arcsin(0.5x)·((π/2) – arcsin x).
That is, one writes
  I = (π/2)·∫₀¹ x·arcsin(0.5x) dx – ∫₀¹ x·arcsin(0.5x)·arcsin x dx.
Each of these two integrals may then be attacked by standard methods (for example, by making a substitution x = cosθ or by differentiating under a parameter) so that after some manipulation the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (One may show that a great deal of cancellation occurs so that the dilogarithms drop out, leaving the answer above.) 

2. An alternative method is to make the substitution
  u = arccos x                (so that x = cos u, dx = – sin u du),
so that the limits become u = π/2 (when x = 0) and u = 0 (when x = 1) and the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [cos u · sin u · u · arcsin(0.5 cos u)] du.
After writing cos u sin u = (½) sin (2u) and then “massaging” the resulting integrals (for example, by representing the inverse‐sine function as an integral) one may eventually arrive at the answer above.

3. A fairly lengthy (but entirely elementary) computation shows that
  I = (π²)/(96) + (1/32)·ln²((1+√5)/2).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1100440000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  (π²)/(96) + (1/32)·ln²((1+√5)/2)

is acceptable.
