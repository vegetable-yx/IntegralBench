We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ [2^(–m) Γ(m/2 + 3/4) Γ(m/2 + 5/4)]⁄[(m!)² Γ(m + 2)],

so that

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) I₀(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx ≈ 2.5911440000.

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at a representation equivalent to the answer above.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. (A Change of Variable)

A good substitution is
  x = 2 sin²θ,   0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
and one computes
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (2–x)^(1/4) = (2 cos²θ)^(1/4)= 2^(1/4) cos^(1/2)θ.
Also, note that
  x(2–x) = (2 sin²θ)(2 cos²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 4^(1/4)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
            = √2 · (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Finally, inserting all these into the integrand we obtain
  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(1/4)dx = [2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ · 2^(1/4) cos^(1/2)θ]·[4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
            = 4 sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ dθ.
Thus the integral becomes

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ I₀(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. (Expanding the Bessel Function)

Recall that the modified Bessel function I₀ has the series
  I₀(z) = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ (z/2)^(2m)/(m!)².
So here one writes
  I₀(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2))
     = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ [ (√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2))/2 ]^(2m)/(m!)²
     = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2^(–m) (sinθ cosθ)^(m)/(m!)².
Inserting this series into the θ–integral and interchanging sum and integral gives

  I = 4∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2^(–m)/(m!)² ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2 + m)θ cos^(3/2 + m)θ dθ.

But the remaining θ–integral is a standard Beta–integral. In fact one may show that

  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(A–1)θ cos^(B–1)θ dθ = ½ B(A/2, B/2),
so that with A = m + 3/2 and B = m + 5/2 one obtains

  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(m + 1/2)θ cos^(m + 3/2)θ dθ
     = ½ B((m + 3/2)/2, (m + 5/2)/2)
     = ½ B(m/2 + 3/4, m/2 + 5/4).
Thus

  I = 4∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2^(–m)/(m!)² · ½ B(m/2 + 3/4, m/2 + 5/4)
     = 2∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2^(–m)/(m!)² B(m/2 + 3/4, m/2 + 5/4).

Writing the Beta–function in terms of Gamma–functions (that is, B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a + b)) we obtain

  I = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2^(–m) [Γ(m/2 + 3/4) Γ(m/2 + 5/4)]⁄[(m!)² Γ(m + 2)].

This is equivalent to the answer given at the start.

Step 3. (The Final Answer)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ [2^(–m) Γ(m/2 + 3/4) Γ(m/2 + 5/4)]⁄[(m!)² Γ(m + 2)]
         ≈ 2.5911440000.
  
Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
