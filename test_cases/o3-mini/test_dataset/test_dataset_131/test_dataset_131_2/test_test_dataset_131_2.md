One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of gamma–functions and a generalized hypergeometric function. For example one may prove that

  (1) ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) I₀( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx
     = (9/4) · Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) · _1F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; 1/16).

A short comment is in order. (Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct.) One may show by a suitable change of variable (for example, setting x = 2 sin²θ so that x(2–x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ, etc.) and then expanding the Bessel function in its series
  I₀(z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n)/(2^(2n)(n!)²)
that the original integral may be rearranged into the series
  I = 2 Σₙ₌₀∞ (1/2)ⁿ/(n!)²·[Γ((n+3/2)/2) Γ((n+5/2)/2)/Γ(n+2)].
A little work shows that this series equals the _1F₂–representation given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  (2) (9/4)·Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) · _1F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; 1/16) ≈ 2.5778878477.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(1/4) I₀((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx 
    = (9/4)·Γ(3/4)Γ(5/4)·_1F₂(½; 3/4, 5/4; 1/16) ≈ 2.5778878477.
