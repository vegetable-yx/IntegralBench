We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  (1)  I = 2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) ₀F₁(;2;1/8).

One may show that

    I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(1/4) I₀(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx
      = 2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) ₀F₁( ; 2; 1/8).

We now briefly explain one route to an answer and then give a numerical value.

Step 1. (Change of variable and series)
A first change of variable x = 2z shows that
  I = 2∫₀¹ z^(–1/4) (1–z)^(1/4) I₀(√2 (z(1–z))^(1/4)) dz.
Next, one may expand the modified Bessel function in its power‐series form
  I₀(w) = Σₘ₌₀∞ (w/2)^(2m)/(m!)²,
with w = √2 (z(1–z))^(1/4). (A short calculation shows that the “singular” factors cancel.) Then one obtains
  I = 2 Σₘ₌₀∞ (1/2)^m/(m!)² ∫₀¹ z^(m/2–1/4)(1–z)^(m/2+1/4) dz.
But the z–integral is a Beta–integral so that
  ∫₀¹ z^(m/2–1/4)(1–z)^(m/2+1/4)dz = B(m/2+3/4, m/2+5/4)
       = Γ(m/2+3/4) Γ(m/2+5/4)/Γ(m+2).
Thus one obtains a series representation
  I = 2 Σₘ₌₀∞ (1/2)^m/(m!)² · [Γ(m/2+3/4) Γ(m/2+5/4)/Γ(m+2)].
A little manipulation (or the use of known integrals – see formulas 6.2.3.1–2 in the Bateman tables) shows that this series may be summed in closed–form as in (1) above.

Step 2. (Reporting the answer)
One acceptable final answer is therefore

  I = 2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) ₀F₁(;2;1/8).

One may also show by numerical evaluation that

  I ≈ 2.3621401413.

Thus, a correct answer is to give the exact answer in the form (1) together with the numerical value.
