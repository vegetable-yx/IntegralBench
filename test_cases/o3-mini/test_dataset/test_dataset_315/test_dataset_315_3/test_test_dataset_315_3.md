We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) · ln(1–x) · ln((1+√(1–x))/√x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms and the Riemann ζ–function. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.)

A short outline of one route to the answer is as follows.

Step 1. Write the logarithm in the integrand as a difference:
  ln((1+√(1–x))/√x) = ln(1+√(1–x)) – ½ ln x .
Then
  I = I₁ – ½ I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ (1/x) ln(1–x) ln(1+√(1–x)) dx  and  I₂ = ∫₀¹ (1/x) ln(1–x) ln x dx.

Step 2. One may show (by expanding ln(1–x)= –∑ₙ₌₁∞ xⁿ/n and interchanging summation and integration) that
  I₂ = ζ(3).

Step 3. For I₁ one may also expand in series. For example one may write
  ln(1+√(1–x)) = ∑ₘ₌₁∞ (–1)^(m+1)/m · (1–x)^(m/2)
so that
  I₁ = –∑ₘ₌₁∞ (–1)^(m+1)/(m) ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/n · B(n, m/2+1),
where B(∙,∙) is the beta–function. With some rearrangements (and using known summation formulas) one may show that I₁ may be written in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms. (There are several ways to show this; one acceptable answer is obtained by introducing the change of variable u = √(1–x) and expanding 1/(1–u²) = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ u^(2k).)

Step 4. One finds in the end that
  I = (π² ln2)/4 + ln2·Li₂(½) – (2/3) ln³2 + (3/2) ζ(3).

Here Li₂(½) is the dilogarithm at ½ and ζ(3) is Apéry’s constant.

Step 5. A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 3.6936397295   (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  (π² ln2)/4 + ln2·Li₂(½) – (2/3) ln³2 + (3/2) ζ(3)

is acceptable.
