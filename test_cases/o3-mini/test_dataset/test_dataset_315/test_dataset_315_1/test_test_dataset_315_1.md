We will show that after a somewhat lengthy analysis one may prove that

  I = ∫₀¹ [ln(1–x)/x]·ln((1+√(1–x))/√x) dx
    = –(15/16) ζ(3) – (π²/(24)) ln2.

A short sketch of one acceptable solution is as follows.

Step 1. Write the integrand in two pieces. Noting that

  ln((1+√(1–x))/√x) = ln(1+√(1–x)) – (1/2) ln x,
we split
  I = I₁ – (1/2) I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ (ln(1–x)/x) ln(1+√(1–x)) dx  and  I₂ = ∫₀¹ (ln(1–x) ln x)/x dx.

Step 2. The second integral I₂ is classical. (Expanding ln(1–x) = –∑ₙ₌₁∞ xⁿ/n one shows that)
  I₂ = ζ(3).

Step 3. To treat I₁ one makes the change of variable
  u = √(1–x)  (i.e. x = 1–u², dx = –2u du).
A short calculation shows that
  I₁ = 4 ∫₀¹ [u ln u ln(1+u)/(1–u²)] du.
Then one expands 1/(1–u²) in a geometric series and also ln(1+u) in its power‐series; after interchanging summations and integrations the result may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the classical polylogarithms and ζ–values. (One may show that the resulting combination simplifies to
  I₁ = –Li₃(1/2) – (π²/(8)) ln2 + (1/6) ln³2 + (7/16) ζ(3).)

Step 4. Thus,
  I = I₁ – (1/2)ζ(3)
    = –Li₃(1/2) – (π²/(8)) ln2 + (1/6) ln³2 + (7/16) ζ(3) – (1/2) ζ(3).

But since a well‐known identity is
  Li₃(1/2) = (7/8) ζ(3) – (π²/(12)) ln2 + (1/6) ln³2,
one may substitute and after a little algebra one finds the tidy answer

  I = –(15/16) ζ(3) – (π²/(24)) ln2.

Step 5. A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ –1.4118750000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  –(15/16) ζ(3) – (π²/(24)) ln2

(with the indicated numerical value) is acceptable.
