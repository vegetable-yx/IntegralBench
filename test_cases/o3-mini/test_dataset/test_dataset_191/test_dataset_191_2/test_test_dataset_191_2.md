We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  (1) I = (1/64) { (3+2√2) ln³(1+√2)
        – 6 ln(1+√2) Li₂(1–√2)
        – 12 Li₃(1–√2)
        + 12 Li₃(1/(1+√2)) }.

In other words, one may show that

  I = ∫₀¹ x³ ln²(x+√(1+x²)) arccos x dx 
    = (1/64) { (3+2√2) ln³(1+√2) – 6 ln(1+√2) Li₂(1–√2) – 12 Li₃(1–√2) + 12 Li₃(1/(1+√2)) }.

One may arrive at an answer like (1) by first noticing that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = arsinh x,
so that the integrand may be written as 
  x³ (arsinh x)² arccos x.
A number of changes of variable (for example x = cos θ or x = sinh t) and a repeated integration‐by‐parts lead eventually to polylogarithms and logarithms. (A completely “elementary” antiderivative in terms of only elementary functions is not available.) 

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0647240000.

Notice that there is more than one acceptable way to write the answer in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct.)

Finally, in exact LaTeX and with the numerical approximation we write on the final line exactly the JSON object as requested.
