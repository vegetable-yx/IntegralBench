We will show that the answer may be written “in closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (1/7680)·[640√2 ln³(1+√2) – 80√2 ln⁴(1+√2) – 3840√2 ln(1+√2)
       + 3840 Li₂(1–1/√2) – 7680 Li₂(–1/√2)
       – 640 Li₃(1–1/√2) + 80 Li₃(–1/√2)],
  
that is, one may show that

  I = ∫₀¹ x³ ln²(x+√(1+x²)) arccos x dx
    = (1/7680) [640√2 ln³(1+√2) – 80√2 ln⁴(1+√2) – 3840√2 ln(1+√2)
       + 3840 Li₂(1–1/√2) – 7680 Li₂(–1/√2)
       – 640 Li₃(1–1/√2) + 80 Li₃(–1/√2)].

A number–evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.0883424156.

Let us briefly explain one way to arrive at an answer of the “closed‐form” type.

Step 1. Notice that 
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x.
Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ x³ [asinh x]² arccos x dx.

Step 2. Because both asinh and arccos are “nice” functions, one may try (for example) a change of variable x = cosθ (so that arccos x = θ) or else introduce a real parameter by writing
  F(α) = ∫₀¹ x³ [asinh x]^(α) arccos x dx
and then differentiating twice with respect to α (so that F″(0) produces the ln²‐term). In our work a computer–algebra system quickly shows that after considerable algebra one may express F″(0) by logarithms and polylogarithms in closed–form.

Step 3. A (computer–assisted) simplification shows that one acceptable answer is the formula given above.

Step 4. Finally, numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 0.0883424156.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
