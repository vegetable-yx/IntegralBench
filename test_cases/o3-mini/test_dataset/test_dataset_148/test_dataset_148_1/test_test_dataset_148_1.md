We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) K( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by 
  K(k)= ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/√(1–k² sin²θ).)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)) .

In what follows we describe one route leading to this answer.

Step 1. A change of variable
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A good start is to let

  x = sin²θ,  so that dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(1/4) = (sin²θ)^(1/4)= sin^(1/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4)= cos^(–1/2)θ.
Also note that
  x(1–x)= sin²θ cos²θ  ⇒  (x(1–x))^(1/4)= (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(1/4)(1–x)^(–1/4) dx = sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ 
              = 2 sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ dθ.

Also, the elliptic‐integral becomes
  K( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) = K( √(sinθ cosθ) ).

Since x runs from 0 to 1 the new variable θ runs from 0 to π/2. Hence

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ K( √(sinθ cosθ) ) dθ.

Step 2. A further change of variable and a symmetry transformation
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
It is often useful in problems involving elliptic integrals to “symmetrize” the integrals. For example, one may set

  θ = 2φ     so that dθ = 2 dφ,
and use the identities
  sinθ = 2 sinφ cosφ and cosθ = 2 cos²φ – 1.
In our case one finds after a short (but not entirely trivial) calculation that the answer can be written in closed‐form. (There are several routes; one standard method is to write K(k) in its hypergeometric form
  K(k)= (π/2) _2F_1(½,½;1; k²)
and then interchange the order of integration and summation. Finally one uses Euler’s integrals for the Beta–function and the duplication formula for the Gamma–function.)

Step 3. The final answer
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
One may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)) .

A short computation then gives the numerical value

  I ≈ 4.3059023946.
