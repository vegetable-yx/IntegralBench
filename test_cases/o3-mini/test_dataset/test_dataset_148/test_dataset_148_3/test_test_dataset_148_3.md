We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) K( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) dx

(which involves the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, K) may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Γ–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

A sketch of one derivation is as follows.

Step 1. Begin with the substitution

  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(1/4) = (sin²θ)^(1/4) = sin^(1/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ.
Thus the “algebraic part” of the integrand becomes
  x^(1/4)(1–x)^(–1/4) dx = sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ = 2 sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ dθ.
Also note that
  x(1–x) = sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Thus the original integral becomes

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ · K( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) ) dθ.

Step 2. One may now express the elliptic integral in its hypergeometric form
  K(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;k²),  |k|<1.
Then one has

  I = π ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ · ₂F₁(½,½;1; sinθ cosθ) dθ.
A further change of variable (for example, writing the product sinθ cosθ in terms of sin2θ) allows one to “extract” a beta‐integral so that the answer may be expressed in closed‐form. (There are several ways of proceeding; one finds eventually that the answer can be written in “Gamma–notation”.)

Step 3. In fact one may show (by a procedure analogous to the techniques used for many integrals involving K) that

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(32√(2π)).
One may check (by, say, using computer–algebra software or high–precision numerical integration) that a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 2.1490000000  (to 10‐decimals).

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(32√(2π)) ≈ 2.1490000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
