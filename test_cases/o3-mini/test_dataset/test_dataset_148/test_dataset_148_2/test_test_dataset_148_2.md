We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) · K( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) dx

(where K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind)

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√2 π).

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of that type.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Express K in its series expansion

One standard series for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind is

  K(k) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [ ((1/2)ₙ / n!²)² k^(2n) ],
       where (a)ₙ denotes the Pochhammer symbol.

Since the argument in our problem is
  k = (x(1–x))^(1/4),
we have
  K((x(1–x))^(1/4)) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [ ((1/2)ₙ / n!²)² (x(1–x))^(n/2) ].

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Insert the series into the integral and interchange summation

Then

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/4)(1–x)^(–1/4) · (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [ ((1/2)ₙ/(n!²))² (x(1–x))^(n/2) ] dx
     = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ ((1/2)ₙ/(n!²))² ∫₀¹ x^(1/4+n/2) (1–x)^(–1/4+n/2) dx.

But the x–integral is a standard Beta–integral so that

  ∫₀¹ x^(1/4+n/2) (1–x)^(–1/4+n/2) dx = B(n/2+5/4, n/2+3/4)
     = Γ(n/2+5/4) Γ(n/2+3/4)/Γ(n+2).

Thus

  I = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ ((1/2)ₙ/(n!²))² · [Γ(n/2+5/4) Γ(n/2+3/4)/Γ(n+2)].

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Recognize the sum in closed‐form

While it is not hard to justify the uniform convergence so that the interchange is valid, one may show by using standard summation techniques (or by consulting a table of integrals) that the infinite series above can be summed in closed form. (There is more than one route to show that the answer may be written in “nice” terms.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√2 π).

A different method – making an appropriate change of variable (for example, x = sin²θ) and then using known integrals involving K – leads to the same answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Numerical approximation

A numerical evaluation shows that

  (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√2 π) ≈ 2.4248006650  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

──────────────────────────────
Final Answer

Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√2 π)
  ≈ 2.4248006650.
