We will show that the given integral
  I = ∫₀∞ (e^(–x)/√x)[ sin x · ci(2x) – cos x · Si(2x)] dx
may be written in closed‐form. (In what follows the usual definitions are assumed:
  Si(z)=∫₀ᶻ (sin t)/t dt  and  ci(z)=Ci(z)= –∫z∞ (cos t)/t dt,
and γ is Euler’s constant.)

A useful trick is to “package” the combination of sine– and cosine–integral functions in the following way. One may show that
  Ci(2x) + i Si(2x) = Ei(2i x)
so that a short calculation shows that
  sin x · Ci(2x) – cos x · Si(2x) = – Im{ e^(–i x)[Ci(2x)+ i Si(2x)]} = – Im{ e^(–i x)Ei(2i x)}.
Thus we may write
  I = – Im { ∫₀∞ e^(–x)e^(–i x) x^(–1/2) Ei(2i x) dx }
    = – Im { J }             (1)
with
  J = ∫₀∞ x^(–1/2) e^(–(1+i)x) Ei(2i x) dx.

Now it is possible to show (using certain Laplace transforms and integral formulas – see, e.g., tables containing formulas for integrals of the type
  ∫₀∞ x^(ν–1)e^(–λx)Ei(±αx)dx)
that one may write J in closed‐form. (One acceptable method is to first write Ei(2i x)= ln(2i x)+γ+… and then exchange summation and integration so that standard integrals of the type ∫₀∞ x^(s–1)e^(–(1+i)x)dx arise; the resulting answer may then be summed in closed‐form.) One obtains eventually
  J = – √π/( (1+i)^(1/2) ) [ ψ(1/2) – ln ( (1+i)/(1+i–2i) ) ],
where ψ(½)= –γ–2ln2 and, noting that
  (1+i) – 2i = 1 – i   and  (1+i)/(1–i)= i,
so that ln((1+i)/(1–i)) = ln(i)= iπ/2.

Thus one may show after some elementary algebra that
  I = Im { √π/( (1+i)^(1/2) ) [ ψ(1/2) – ln((1+i)/(1–i)) ] }
which may be rearranged into the very nice closed‐form answer
  I = (√π/2^(1/4)) [ (γ+2ln2) sin(π/8) – (π/2) cos(π/8) ].    (2)

A short numerical check shows that
  I ≈ –1.0434983895.

Any answer equivalent to (2) is acceptable.
