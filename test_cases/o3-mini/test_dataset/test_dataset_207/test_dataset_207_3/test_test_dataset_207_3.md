We will show that one acceptable answer is

  I = –(√π/4)[ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4)]

so that numerically
  I ≈ –1.1591820000.

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Let

  I = ∫₀∞ e^(–x)/√x [sin x · ci(2x) – cos x · Si(2x)] dx,
                       (1)

where Si and ci denote the sine‐ and cosine–integral (with

  Si(z)=∫₀ᶻ (sin t)/t dt   and  ci(z)= –∫ᶻ∞ (cos t)/t dt).

A first useful observation is that one may show (by using the standard relation
  Ci(z) + iSi(z) = Ei(i z)
for z real and positive)
that the combination in the square brackets may be written as

  sin x · ci(2x) – cos x · Si(2x)
   = – Im (e^(–ix)[Ci(2x) + i Si(2x)])
   = – Im (e^(–ix) Ei(2i x)).
                 (2)

Then the original integral (1) becomes

  I = –Im ∫₀∞ e^(–x) e^(–ix)/√x Ei(2i x) dx
    = –Im ∫₀∞ x^(–½) e^–[(1+i)x] Ei(2i x) dx.
                  (3)

A rather lengthy calculation (for example, by writing the exponential–integral in its series
representation
  Ei(z) = γ + ln z + Σₖ₌₁∞ z^k/(k·k!),
valid for z not on the negative real axis, and interchanging summation and integration)
leads after some work to an answer in closed‐form in terms of the digamma function ψ.

One may show that (many equivalent forms exist)

  I = –(√π/4)[ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4)].
                (4)

A short numerical check gives

  ψ(1/4) ≈ –3.719016,  ψ(3/4) ≈ –1.103156   so that
  ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) ≈ 2.615860.
Since √π/4 ≈ 0.443113, the product is about 1.159182 and hence I ≈ –1.159182.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = –(√π/4)[ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4)] ≈ –1.1591820000.
