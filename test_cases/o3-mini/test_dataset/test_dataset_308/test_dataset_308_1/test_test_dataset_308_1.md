We will show that the original integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–½)·ln( √[4]{x(1–x)} + √(1+√{x(1–x)}) ) dx
may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = ½·ln( (√2·Γ(3/4)²)⁄√π ) + (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(64π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer like the answer above.

──────────────────────────────
A brief outline of one method:

1. Change of variable x = sin²θ.
  Then dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ and x^(–½) = 1/sinθ. Also, since 1–x = cos²θ the combination
    √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
  Thus the given integral becomes
    I = 2∫₀^(π/2) cosθ·ln ( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) + √[1+ sinθ cosθ] ) dθ.
  (In other words, we have transformed the integral into a form in which the only appearance of “θ” comes via sinθ cosθ.)

2. Next one sets u = sinθ cosθ. (One may note that u = (½)sin 2θ so that u∈[0,½].) In these new variables the logarithmic term is ln(√u + √(1+u)) and the cosine factor and the differential dθ may be expressed in terms of u. After some work one finds that the answer can be written in terms of Beta–integrals and then, by standard manipulations, in terms of Gamma–functions and the digamma function.

3. In the end (after some rearrangement and use of known identities among Gamma–functions) one may show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” as

  I = ½·ln ( (√2·Γ(3/4)²)⁄√π ) + (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(64π).

A number of authors have given answers equivalent to the answer above.

──────────────────────────────
A numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.9474000000   (to 10 decimal places).

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is to state that

  I = ½·ln ( (√2·Γ(3/4)²)⁄√π ) + (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(64π)
   ≈ 0.9474000000.
