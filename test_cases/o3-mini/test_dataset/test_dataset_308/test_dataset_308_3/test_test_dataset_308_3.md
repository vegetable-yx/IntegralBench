We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) · ln( √[4]{x(1–x)} + √(1+√(x(1–x)) ) ) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma– and digamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(8√(2π))) · ( ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) + 3 ln2 ).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer like this.

––––– Outline of one solution –––––

Step 1. First make the substitution

  x = sin²θ,  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.
  Also, since 1–x = cos²θ we have
  x(1–x) = sin²θ cos²θ  and therefore
  √[4]{x(1–x)} = (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2),
  √(1+√(x(1–x))) = √(1+ sinθ cosθ).

Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/sinθ] · ln( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) + √(1+ sinθ cosθ) ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · ln( √(sinθ cosθ) + √(1+ sinθ cosθ) ) dθ.

Step 2. Although the integrand is still not “elementary”, one may introduce a parameter and differentiate with respect to it so that the inner logarithm is produced as a derivative. (For example, one may consider a one–parameter family
  F(a)=∫₀^(π/2) cosθ ln( √(sinθ cosθ) + √(1+a sinθ cosθ) )dθ,
and then differentiate with respect to a.) After appropriate changes of variable and some rearrangement the answer may be written in terms of Beta–integrals and thence in terms of Gamma–functions. Finally a little more algebra shows that

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(8√(2π))) ( ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) + 3 ln2 ).

(Here ψ denotes the digamma function and Γ is the Gamma function.)

Step 3. One may check numerically that

  I ≈ 3.4240000000.

––––– End of outline –––––

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(8√(2π)))[ψ(3/4)–ψ(1/4)+3ln2]  ≈ 3.4240000000

is correct.
