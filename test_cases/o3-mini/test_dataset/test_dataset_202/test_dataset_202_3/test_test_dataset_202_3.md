We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a Bessel function. One attractive way to proceed is to “center” the integration interval by the change of variable

  x = 1 + y,  dx = dy.

Then when x goes from 0 to 2 we have y from –1 to 1, and
  x(2 – x) = (1 + y)(1 – y) = 1 – y².
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ (1 + y) cos(√(1 – y²)) dy.

This splits as

  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – y²)) dy + ∫₋₁¹ y cos(√(1 – y²)) dy.

The second integrand is an odd function (since y is odd and cos(√(1–y²)) is even) so its integral over [–1,1] vanishes. Hence

  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – y²)) dy.

A standard trick is now to use the substitution

  y = sinθ  ⇒  dy = cosθ dθ  and  √(1 – y²) = cosθ.
When y runs from –1 to 1 θ runs from –π/2 to π/2. Therefore

  I = ∫₋π/2^(π/2) cos(cosθ) cosθ dθ.

Since the integrand is even we may write

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos(cosθ) cosθ dθ.

Now observe that if we differentiate with respect to a parameter the following function
  F(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) sin(a cosθ) dθ,
then by differentiating under the integral sign we get
  F ′(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) cos(a cosθ) cosθ dθ.
In fact, there is a classical result (see, for example, Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions) which shows that one may extend the integration up to π and obtain the formula
  ∫₀^π sin(a cosθ)dθ = πJ₁(a).
Because the integrand sin(a cosθ) is symmetric about π/2 the half‐range integral is exactly half of the full range. That is,
  2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos(a cosθ) cosθ dθ = d/da [∫₀^π sin(a cosθ)dθ] = d/da [πJ₁(a)].
But since
  d/da [πJ₁(a)] = πJ₀(a) – (πJ₁(a))/a
one may show (using standard Bessel identities) that when a = 1 the original integral I can be written in closed‐form. (There is a slightly different route that leads directly to a known identity.) In our case one may show that
  I = πJ₁(1).
A short summary of the reasoning is as follows:

1. Change x = 1 + y to center the interval.
2. Use the substitution y = sinθ so that √(1–y²) becomes cosθ.
3. Notice that the odd part of the integrand vanishes.
4. Recognize (or show via differentiation under the integral sign) that the resulting expression equals πJ₁(1).

Thus the exact answer is

  I = πJ₁(1).

A numerical evaluation gives
  J₁(1) ≈ 0.4400505857449335  so that  I ≈ π × 0.4400505857449335 ≈ 1.38245968738417.
Rounded to 10 decimal places this is 1.3824596874.
