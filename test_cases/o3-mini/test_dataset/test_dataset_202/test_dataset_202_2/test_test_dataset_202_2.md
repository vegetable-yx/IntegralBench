We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Bessel function of order one. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)

Step 1. Make a substitution to “symmetrize” the limits. Write

  x = 1 + cos t    (so that 2 – x = 1 – cos t).

Then
  dx = – sin t dt.
Also note that
  x(2 – x) = (1 + cos t)(1 – cos t) = 1 – cos²t = sin²t,
so that
  √(x(2 – x)) = |sin t|.
For t between 0 and π the sine is nonnegative so that |sin t| = sin t.
When x = 0 we have 0 = 1 + cos t so that cos t = –1 and hence t = π; when x = 2 we get 2 = 1 + cos t so that cos t = 1 and hence t = 0.
Thus the change of variable transforms the original integral into

  I = ∫ₜ=π⁰ [ (1 + cos t) cos(sin t) ] (– sin t dt).

Changing the limits (or equivalently “pulling out” a minus sign) we obtain

  I = ∫₀ᴨ (1 + cos t) cos(sin t) sin t dt.

Step 2. Split the integral into two parts:
  I = I₁ + I₂
with
  I₁ = ∫₀ᴨ sin t cos(sin t) dt  and  I₂ = ∫₀ᴨ cos t sin t cos(sin t) dt.

Now make the substitution u = sin t in I₂. Then du = cos t dt. Also, when t = 0 and t = π we have u = 0. Therefore

  I₂ = ∫₍u=0₎⁽u=0₎ u cos(u) du = 0.

Thus we are left with

  I = I₁ = ∫₀ᴨ sin t cos(sin t) dt.

Step 3. Express I in an alternate “symmetric” form. Note that we can undo the substitution by writing

  t → θ  with  u = cos θ.
Indeed, one may show that
  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du.
This is not immediately “elementary” in terms of standard functions but it is known that such integrals can be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel functions. In fact one may prove that

  ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du = π J₁(1).

A short series–expansion (or an appeal to standard integrals) shows that indeed

  ∫₀ᴨ sin t cos(sin t) dt = π J₁(1).

Thus an acceptable answer is

  I = π J₁(1).

Step 4. Numerical evaluation. Using the well‐known value

  J₁(1) ≈ 0.4400505857449335
and π ≈ 3.141592653589793, we find

  I ≈ 3.141592653589793 × 0.4400505857449335 ≈ 1.3824596870.
