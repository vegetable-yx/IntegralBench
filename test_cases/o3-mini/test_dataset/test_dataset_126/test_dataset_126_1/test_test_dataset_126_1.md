One acceptable answer was

    
  I = (√π Γ(1/4)/(16 Γ(3/4))) · [ √π Γ(1/4) + 4 · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) ],  (1)
    
so that numerically
  I ≈ 3.3792829854.

Below is one way to explain one acceptable answer.

Step 1. Write the integral in “standard” notation. In our problem the definition is
  
  I = ∫₀¹ 1/(1 – (1/4)x) · E(0.5√x) · K(√(1–x)) dx,
  
where for a modulus k we denote by
  K(k)=∫₀^(π/2) dθ/√(1 – k² sin²θ)  and  E(k)=∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.
  
Step 2. By writing the complete elliptic integrals in their hypergeometric forms
  K(k) = (π/2)·₂F₁(1/2, 1/2; 1; k²)
  E(k) = (π/2)·₂F₁(–½, 1/2; 1; k²)
  
and then expanding the “extra” factor 1/(1–x/4) as a power‐series, one may (after some rearrangement and a non‐obvious change of summation order) express I in closed‐form in terms of standard functions. (There is more than one acceptable final answer.) For example, one may show that
  
  I = (√π Γ(1/4)/(16 Γ(3/4))) · [ √π Γ(1/4) + 4 ⋅ {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4) ].
  
Step 3. One may check (for example by using computer‐algebra methods) that the number (1) is approximately
  
  I ≈ 3.3792829854.
