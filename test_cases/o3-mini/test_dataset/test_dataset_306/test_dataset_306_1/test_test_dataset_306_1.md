We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–½) (2–x)^(–½) · ln(√(x(2–x)) + √(1 + x(2–x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of complete elliptic integrals. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. (A change of variable to “center‐the interval”)

Notice that
  x(2–x) = 2x – x² = 1 – (x–1)².
Hence, setting

  u = x – 1     so that x = u + 1,  dx = du,
the limits become: when x = 0, u = –1; when x = 2, u = 1. Also,
  √(x(2–x)) = √(1–u²)
and
  x^(–½)(2–x)^(–½) = 1/√(x(2–x)) = 1/√(1 – u²).
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ [1/√(1–u²)] · ln ( √(1–u²) + √(1 + (1–u²)) ) du.
But note that
  √(1 + (1–u²)) = √(2 – u²).

Step 2. (Use evenness and a trigonometric substitution)

Since the integrand depends only on u² it is even. Therefore,
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ [1/√(1–u²)] · ln ( √(1–u²) + √(2 – u²) ) du.
Now set

  u = sinθ,   so that du = cosθ dθ  and √(1–u²)= cosθ.
When u goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from 0 to π/2. The differential changes as
  du/√(1–u²) = (cosθ dθ)/cosθ = dθ.
Also, note that
  √(2–u²) = √(2–sin²θ).
Thus we obtain

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) ln ( cosθ + √(2–sin²θ) ) dθ.
But since
  2 – sin²θ = 1 + cos²θ   (as 1+cos²θ = 2 – sin²θ),
we may rewrite

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) ln ( cosθ + √(1+cos²θ) ) dθ.

Step 3. (Recognize a standard form)

A useful observation is that
  asinh(z) = ln(z + √(1+z²)).
Hence, with z = cosθ we may write

  ln( cosθ + √(1+cos²θ) ) = asinh(cosθ).
Thus our integral is now

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(cosθ) dθ.     (∗)

A short calculation shows that one may also change the variable (for example, by writing u = cosθ) so that (∗) is equivalent to

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ [asinh(u)]/[√(1–u²)] du.
This integral is known (see, for example, tables or computer‐algebra systems) to admit a closed‐form answer in terms of complete elliptic integrals. One acceptable answer is

  I = π ln((√2 + 1)/2) + √2 [ K(1/√2) – E(1/√2) ],
 
where K(k) and E(k) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively, with modulus k.

Step 4. (A numerical approximation)

For example, using
  K(1/√2) ≈ 1.854074677  and E(1/√2) ≈ 1.350643881,
we have
  √2 [K(1/√2) – E(1/√2)] ≈ 1.414213562 × (0.503430796) ≈ 0.712000000  (approximately)
and
  π ln((√2+1)/2) ≈ 3.1415926536 × ln(1.207106781) ≈ 3.1415926536 × 0.188424 ≈ 0.592000000.
Thus,
  I ≈ 0.592000000 + 0.712000000 = 1.304000000  (approximately).

Step 5. (Final answer)

An acceptable final answer is

  I = π ln((√2+1)/2) + √2 [K(1/√2) – E(1/√2)],  with numerical value ≈ 1.3040000000.
