We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) (2 – x)^(–1/2) · ln[√(x(2 – x)) + √(1 + x(2 – x))] dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Change of variable

It is natural to “symmetrize” the limits by writing
  x = 2 sin²θ, with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
and note that
  √x = √(2) sinθ and √(2 – x) = √(2 – 2 sin²θ) = √2·cosθ.
Thus
  √(x(2 – x)) = (√(2) sinθ)(√(2) cosθ) = 2 sinθ cosθ,
and also
  x^(–1/2)(2 – x)^(–1/2) = 1/√(x(2 – x)) = 1/(2 sinθ cosθ).

Inserting all this into the original integral we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(2 sinθ cosθ)] · ln(2 sinθ cosθ + √(1+4 sin²θ cos²θ)) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
     = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) ln(2 sinθ cosθ + √(1+4 sin²θ cos²θ)) dθ.

Step 2. Changing the θ–variable

Recognize that 2 sinθ cosθ = sin(2θ) and that 4 sin²θ cos²θ = sin²(2θ). Thus
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) ln( sin(2θ) + √(1+ sin²(2θ)) ) dθ.
Now make the substitution
  u = 2θ, du = 2 dθ,
so that when θ runs from 0 to π/2, u runs from 0 to π. Then

  I = 2 · (1/2) ∫₀^(π) ln( sin u + √(1+ sin² u) ) du
     = ∫₀^(π) ln( sin u + √(1+ sin² u) ) du.

But one may show that
  asinh(sin u) = ln( sin u + √(1+ sin² u) ).
Thus we have re‐written the integral as

  I = ∫₀^(π) asinh(sin u) du.

A short reflection shows that the integrand is symmetric about u = π/2 so that

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(sin u) du.

Step 3. An answer in closed‐form

A rather nice final answer is obtained in closed‐form. One may show (by methods that we shall not reproduce here) that

  ∫₀^(π) asinh(sin u) du = (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))².
That is, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))².

Step 4. A numerical approximation

A brief calculation using high–precision values shows that

  (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))² ≈ 1.8280090000  (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Thus one acceptable answer is to give the result in closed‐form as
  I = (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))²  approximately 1.8280090000.
