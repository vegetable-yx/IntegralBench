We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) tan(cos x) dx.

Step 1. Note that the function tan(cos x) behaves in a symmetric fashion. To expose the symmetry we split the integral into two parts:

  I = ∫₀^(π) tan(cos x) dx + ∫₍π₎^(2π) tan(cos x) dx.

Step 2. In the second integral, perform the substitution:
  Let y = x – π. Then when x = π, y = 0; when x = 2π, y = π; and dx = dy.
  Since
   cos(x) = cos(y + π) = –cos y,
the second integral becomes
  ∫₀^(π) tan(cos(y + π)) dy = ∫₀^(π) tan(–cos y) dy.
Recalling that tan is an odd function (i.e. tan(–θ) = –tan(θ)), we have
  tan(–cos y) = –tan(cos y),
so the second integral simplifies to
  –∫₀^(π) tan(cos y) dy.

Step 3. Thus, the whole integral I becomes:
  I = ∫₀^(π) tan(cos x) dx – ∫₀^(π) tan(cos x) dx = 0.

Step 4. Therefore, the exact answer is 0 and its numerical approximation is also 0 (to 10 decimal places: 0.0000000000).
