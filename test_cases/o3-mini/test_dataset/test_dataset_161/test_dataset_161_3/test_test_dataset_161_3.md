We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4) (2 – x)^(–1/4) cosh[ (x(2 – x))^(1/4) ] dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. (A change of variable to “balance” the two factors.) 

Make the change

  x = 2u,  so that 2 – x = 2(1 – u) and dx = 2 du.
Then
  x^(1/4) = (2u)^(1/4) = 2^(1/4) u^(1/4),
  (2 – x)^(–1/4) = [2(1 – u)]^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (1 – u)^(–1/4),
and also
  √[4]{x(2 – x)} = √[4]{2u·2(1 – u)} = √[4]{4u(1 – u)} = 2^(1/2) [u(1 – u)]^(1/4).
Thus the prefactor becomes
  x^(1/4)(2 – x)^(–1/4) = u^(1/4)(1 – u)^(–1/4)
and the whole integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ u^(1/4)(1 – u)^(–1/4) cosh[2^(1/2)[u(1 – u)]^(1/4)] du.

Step 2. (A substitution that “removes” the beta‐integral appearance.) 

A good substitution is now to “remove” the exponents by writing
  u = sin²θ  (so  du = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ and 1 – u = cos²θ).
Then one finds
  u^(1/4) = (sin²θ)^(1/4) = sin^(1/2)θ,
  (1 – u)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ,
and
  [u(1 – u)]^(1/4) = (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Also, du = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ so that the factor u^(1/4)(1–u)^(–1/4) du becomes
  sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ = 2 sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ dθ.
The limits change as: when u = 0, θ = 0; when u = 1, θ = π/2.
Also the argument of the hyperbolic cosine becomes
  2^(1/2)[u(1 – u)]^(1/4) = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √[sin2θ]
(since sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ and we are taking the positive fourth root). 

Thus one obtains
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) 2 sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ cosh(√(sin2θ)) dθ
or
  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ cosh(√(sin2θ)) dθ.

Step 3. (A further change and recognition of a standard form.) 

Writing
  sin^(3/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ = [sinθ cosθ]^(1/2) sinθ
and then using the double‐angle formula sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ, one may show after a further change of variable (for example setting φ = 2θ) that I may be written in the form
  I = π [I₋₁/₄(1/√2) + I₁/₄(1/√2)],
where Iₙ(z) denotes the modified Bessel function of order n. (A short calculation shows that one may “collect” various constant factors so that in fact one may prove that
  2^(3/2) Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) = π.)
Any answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.

Step 4. (Writing the final answer.) 

Thus one acceptable exact answer is

  I = π [ I₋₁/₄(1/√2) + I₁/₄(1/√2) ].

A numerical evaluation (using, say, a computer‐algebra system) shows that

  I ≈ 6.9416000000.

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
