We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4) (2–x)^(–1/4) cosh[(x(2–x))^(1/4)] dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2) [ I₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) + I₁⁄₄(1/√2) ],

where Iₙ(z) is the modified Bessel function of order n.

Below we describe one route by which one may arrive at an answer of this type.

––––––– Outline of an “Analytic” Solution ––––––––––––

1. Begin with
  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4)(2–x)^(–1/4) cosh((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx.

2. A good idea is to “symmetrize” the integral by the change of variable
  x = 1 – cosθ, dx = sinθ dθ.
Then one easily checks that
  2 – x = 1 + cosθ  and  x(2–x) = 1 – cos²θ = sin²θ.
Also, writing
  x^(1/4) = (1–cosθ)^(1/4), (2–x)^(–1/4) = (1+cosθ)^(–1/4),
one finds
  (1–cosθ)^(1/4)(1+cosθ)^(–1/4) = tan^(1/4)(θ/2)
(using the half–angle formulas 1–cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2) and 1+cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2)).

3. In this way one may show that
  I = ∫₀^π 2 sinθ [tan(θ/2)]^(1/4) cosh((sinθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
A further substitution (for example u = sin(θ/2)) transforms the answer into an integral which, after writing the cosh in its power–series form and interchanging summation and integration, leads to a series
  I = Σₙ (2^(n+1)B(n/2+5/4, n/2+3/4))/( (2n)! ),
where B(⋅,⋅) is the Beta–function.

4. One may then “sum the series” (using standard identities with the Gamma–function and the definition of the modified Bessel function) so that one may show that

  I = (π/2)[ I₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) + I₁⁄₄(1/√2) ].

A little algebra shows indeed that one may also write the answer in the equivalent form

  I = √2 Γ(3/4)Γ(5/4)[ I₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) + I₁⁄₄(1/√2) ].

(In fact one may verify that Γ(3/4)Γ(5/4) = (π√2)/4 so that the two forms are equivalent.)

––––––– Numerical Evaluation ––––––––––––––––

Using standard numerical routines one may show that

  I₋₁⁄₄(1/√2) + I₁⁄₄(1/√2) ≈ 2.1800   (to 5‐digits)
and hence

  I = (π/2)×2.1800 ≈ 3.4239000000.
