We begin by noting that the integral to be computed is

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x · 𝖣(0.5 x) dx.

A natural interpretation (which we adopt here) is that the symbol 𝖣, written in boldface, represents the derivative operator. In other words, 𝖣(0.5 x) is the derivative (with respect to x) of the function 0.5x. (Other interpretations of 𝖣 are possible if 𝖣 is defined differently, but in the absence of further context we take it as “D” meaning differentiation.) Thus we have

  𝖣(0.5 x) = d/dx (0.5 x) = 0.5.

Then the given integral reduces to

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x · 0.5 dx = 0.5 ∫₀¹ arccos x dx.

Now we calculate ∫₀¹ arccos x dx. A standard method is to use integration by parts. Let

  u = arccos x    ⇒ du = –1/√(1 – x²) dx,
  dv = dx      ⇒ v = x.

Then

  ∫ arccos x dx = x·arccos x – ∫ x · (–1/√(1 – x²)) dx
             = x·arccos x + ∫ x/√(1 – x²) dx.

We now evaluate the remaining integral: let

  J = ∫ x/√(1 – x²) dx.

Make the substitution w = 1–x², so that dw = –2x dx or, equivalently, x dx = –dw/2. Then

  J = ∫ x/√(w) dx = –½ ∫ dw/√(w) = –½ · 2√w + C = –√w + C = –√(1 – x²) + C.

Thus, we have

  ∫ arccos x dx = x·arccos x – √(1 – x²) + C.

We now evaluate from 0 to 1:

At x = 1:
  arccos(1) = 0    √(1 – 1²) = 0  → 1·0 – 0 = 0.
At x = 0:
  arccos(0) = π/2   √(1 – 0) = 1  → 0·(π/2) – 1 = –1.

Thus,
  ∫₀¹ arccos x dx = [0 – (–1)] = 1.

Returning to I, we have

  I = 0.5 · 1 = 0.5.

A numerical approximation to ten decimal places is 0.5000000000.
