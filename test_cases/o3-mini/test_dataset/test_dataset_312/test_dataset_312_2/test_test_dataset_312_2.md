We begin by noting that the notation in the integrand is
  ∫₀¹ arccos x • D(0.5x) dx.
In many texts a “Riemann–Stieltjes” integral is written in the form
  ∫ₐᵇ f(x) d(g(x))
so that if g(x) is differentiable one may write d(g(x)) = g′(x) dx. In our case the symbol D(0.5x) is understood to be the “differential” of the function g(x) = 0.5x, since its derivative is
  g′(x) = 0.5.
Thus the given integral may be rewritten as

  ∫₀¹ arccos x • d(0.5x) = ∫₀¹ arccos x • [0.5 dx] = 0.5 ∫₀¹ arccos x dx.

Now we only need to evaluate I = ∫₀¹ arccos x dx.

Step 1. Find an antiderivative of arccos x.
A standard integration formula tells us that

  ∫ arccos x dx = x arccos x − √(1 − x²) + C.

We can check this by differentiating the right‐hand side.

Step 2. Evaluate the antiderivative between 0 and 1.
At the upper limit, x = 1:
  arccos(1) = 0  and  √(1 − 1²) = 0.
Thus the antiderivative gives
  F(1) = 1·0 − 0 = 0.

At the lower limit, x = 0:
  arccos(0) = π/2  and  √(1 − 0²) = 1.
Thus the antiderivative gives
  F(0) = 0·(π/2) − 1 = -1.

Therefore,
  I = F(1) − F(0) = 0 − (−1) = 1.

Step 3. Multiply by the constant factor.
Recalling that our original integral equals 0.5 · I, we have
  Integral = 0.5 · 1 = 0.5.

Step 4. Write the final answers.
The exact answer is ½ and the numerical approximation is 0.5000000000 (10 decimal places).

Thus, the final JSON output is:
{"answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "numerical_answer": "0.5000000000"}
