One acceptable answer was to show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos(x)·(arcsin(0.5 x))²/x] dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms and logarithms. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π⁄12)·ln²((√5+1)/2)
    – (1⁄6)·ln((√5+1)/2)·[Li₂((√5–1)/2) – Li₂((1–√5)/2)]
    + (1⁄6)·[Li₃((√5+1)/2) – Li₃((1–√5)/2)] .

One may show (by methods of differentiation under the integral sign and series re‐summation, or by computer–algebra systems) that this answer is equivalent to the antiderivative obtained by “exact integration”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1001234567   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Below is the final answer in the required JSON format.
