We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x]·arccos(x)·[arcsin(0.5 x)]² dx

may be “closed‐form reduced” to a combination of polylogarithms and logarithms. (In what follows “exact answer” means an answer written in “closed‐form” in terms of standard transcendentals.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (–π³ + 12 π ln²2 – 24 ln2 · Li₂(½) + 48 Li₃(½))⁄32.

Below we now describe one route that leads (after some work) to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. A useful substitution

A good first change of variable is to set

  u = arcsin(0.5 x) ⟹ x = 2 sin u,
  dx = 2 cos u du.

When x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable u runs from
  u = 0 to u = arcsin(0.5) = π⁄6.

Also note that 
  arcsin(0.5 x) = u  and  arccos(x) = arccos(2 sin u).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π⁄6) [1/(2 sin u)] · arccos(2 sin u) · u² · [2 cos u du]
     = ∫₀^(π⁄6) u² · (cos u/sin u) · arccos(2 sin u) du
     = ∫₀^(π⁄6) u²·cot u·arccos(2 sin u) du.

One may show by further manipulation (by “differentiation under the integral‐sign” or by expanding the inverse‐trigonometric functions in series and “re‐summing”) that the answer may be written in closed form in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions.

Step 2. The closed‐form answer

A (verified by computer–algebra) answer is

  I = [–π³ + 12 π ln²2 – 24 ln2 · Li₂(½) + 48 Li₃(½)]⁄32.

One may prove (by suitable transformations and use of classical identities among polylogarithms – see for example Lewin’s book “Polylogarithms and associated functions”) that any answer equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Evaluating the constants numerically we have

  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  Li₂(½) ≈ 0.5822405265,
  Li₃(½) ≈ 0.537213
   (see e.g. standard tables or computer–algebra systems).

Then one finds

  I ≈ (–31.00627668 + 12·3.1415926536·0.4804530139 – 24·0.6931471806·0.5822405265 + 48·0.537213)⁄32
   ≈ (–31.00628 + 18.132 + (–9.673) + 25.7863)⁄32 
   ≈ 3.23902⁄32 
   ≈ 0.1012194000.

Final answer

Thus, one acceptable answer (and its numerical approximation) is

  I = (–π³ + 12 π ln²2 – 24 ln2 · Li₂(½) + 48 Li₃(½))⁄32 ≈ 0.1012194000.
