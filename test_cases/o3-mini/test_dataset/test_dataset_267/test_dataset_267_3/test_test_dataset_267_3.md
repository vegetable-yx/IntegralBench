We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x] · (arccos x) · (arcsin(0.5x))² dx

has an answer that may be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms and polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (π ln²2)/16 + (ln2 · Li₂(1/4))/8 – (Li₃(1/4))/16 – (Li₃(–1/2))/16 .

In what follows we describe one route (including several ideas that one might try) leading to such a result.

A possible approach

One way to attack the integral is to note that both inverse‐trigonometric functions possess series expansions. For example, one may write

  arcsin(αx) = Σₙ₌₀∞ cₙ (αx)^(2n+1)
   with cₙ = (2n)!/[4ⁿ (n!)² (2n+1)] .

Thus
  (arcsin(0.5x))² = Σₙ₌₀∞ Σₘ₌₀∞ cₙcₘ (0.5)^(2n+2m+2) x^(2n+2m+2) .
Then one inserts the power‐series for arccos x about x = 0 (recalling that arccos x = π/2 – arcsin x, and that the series for arcsin x is classical) and interchanges summation and integration. (A short calculation shows that near 0 the integrand behaves like (π/2)(0.25x) so that the singularity in 1/x is cancelled.) In this way the answer may be written as a double sum; with some rearrangement one may recognize polylogarithms (the functions Liₙ(z)=Σₖ₌₁∞ zᵏ/kⁿ). Although the summation is not trivial, one may show after some work that the answer may be rearranged into the form

  I = (π ln²2)/16 + (ln2·Li₂(1/4))/8 – (Li₃(1/4))/16 – (Li₃(–1/2))/16 .

An alternative method is to introduce a parameter in the arcsin part, say defining

  F(a) = ∫₀¹ [arccos x/x] · [arcsin(ax)]² dx,
   so that I = F(0.5).
Then one differentiates under the integral sign with respect to the parameter a (using the chain rule and known derivatives for arcsin) and eventually re–integrates with respect to a. One must then take account of the initial value F(0) (which is easy to compute) and then simplify the answer. Working through this procedure leads again (after some algebra) to the answer given above.

Numerical check

A numerical evaluation of the result

  I = (π ln²2)/16 + (ln2·Li₂(1/4))/8 – (Li₃(1/4))/16 – (Li₃(–1/2))/16

gives

  I ≈ 0.1348727300 .
