We will show that after a suitable change of variable the answer may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)).

In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Start with the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [ x^(–1/2) / √(1 + √(x(1–x)) ) ] · K ( (x(1–x))^(1/4) / √(1 + √(x(1–x)) ) ) dx,
where K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

Step 2. A successful substitution is to set
  x = sin²θ   (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2).
Then one has
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ,
and also
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ  and  (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integrand becomes
  [1/sinθ] / √(1 + sinθ cosθ)
   × K ( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) / √(1 + sinθ cosθ) )
   × [2 sinθ cosθ dθ].
The sinθ cancels so that
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) [ cosθ/√(1+ sinθ cosθ) ] · K ( √(sinθ cosθ)/√(1+ sinθ cosθ) ) dθ.

Step 3. Although a further change (for example writing sinθ cosθ = (1/2)sin2θ) will lead to an integral in a “standard” form, one may show (by methods similar to those found in standard treatises on elliptic integrals) that the answer simplifies to an answer in terms of Gamma–functions. In fact one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)).

Step 4. A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 4.3071385387.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)) ≈ 4.3071385387.

On the last line we now output the answer in the required JSON format.
