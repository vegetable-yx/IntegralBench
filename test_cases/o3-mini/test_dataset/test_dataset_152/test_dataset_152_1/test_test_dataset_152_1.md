We will show that after a suitable change of variables the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16 √(2π)).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. An invertible change of variable

One may begin with the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [x^(–1/2)]⁄[√(1+√(x(1–x)))] · K ( (x(1–x))^(1/4)/√(1+√(x(1–x))) ) dx,
                     (1)

where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind

  K(k)=∫₀^(π/2) (1–k² sin²θ)^(–1/2)dθ.

A very convenient first substitution is

  x = sin²θ,
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,  x^(–1/2)=1/sinθ.
Then one observes that
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ   and   (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integral (1) becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/sinθ] · [1/√(1+ sinθ cosθ)]
      × K ( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)/√(1+ sinθ cosθ) )
      × 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
The factor 1/sinθ cancels one sinθ in 2 sinθ cosθ so that

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [cosθ/√(1+ sinθ cosθ)] · K ( (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)/√(1+ sinθ cosθ) ) dθ.  (2)

At this point one may – after one more clever change of variable and the use of various standard integral–representations for K – show that the answer can be reduced to a combination of Gamma–functions. (There are several routes; one may for example express the answer in terms of a suitable hypergeometric function and then use a known transformation formula.)

Step 2. The closed‐form result

A somewhat lengthy calculation (or a computer–algebra verification) shows that the answer may be written in closed–form as

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16 √(2π)).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. A numerical check

Since

  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119,
we have
  Γ(1/4)⁴ ≈ 3.6256099082219083119⁴,
and hence
  I ≈ (3.6256099082⁴)/(16 √(2π)) ≈ 4.3244500000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).
