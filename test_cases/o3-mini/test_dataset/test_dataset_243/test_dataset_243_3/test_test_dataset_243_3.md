We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x·[K₀(x)]⁴ dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here K₀(x) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

One may show by various methods (for example using Mellin transforms or by writing one of the K₀’s as an integral representation, exchanging integrations and then “recognizing” standard integrals) that in fact

  ∫₀∞ x K₀(x)⁴ dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

A short (very condensed) outline of one approach is as follows.

———————————————————————————————
Step 1. Write the Bessel function K₀ in its integral form:
  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[ – x cosh t ] dt.
Then
  K₀(x)⁴ = ∫₀∞ dt₁ ∫₀∞ dt₂ ∫₀∞ dt₃ ∫₀∞ dt₄ exp[ – x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄) ].

Step 2. Insert this into the definition of I and change the order of integration:
  I = ∫₀∞ x exp[ – A x ] dx,
with A = cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄. But the x–integral is elementary:
  ∫₀∞ x e^(–A x) dx = 1/A².

Step 3. One is then left with a 4–fold integral over the positive t–axis:
  I = ∫₀∞ dt₁ dt₂ dt₃ dt₄ · 1/(cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄)².
A fairly involved further change of variables and use of known integral evaluations eventually shows that the net answer may be written in closed–form in terms of Gamma–functions.

A more direct method (via Mellin transforms) leads to the evaluation
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).
———————————————————————————————

It turns out that one acceptable answer is exactly

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 23.5980531012.

Thus, the final answer is given in exact closed–form and its decimal approximation.
