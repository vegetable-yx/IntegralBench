We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x·[K₀(x)]⁴ dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here K₀(x) is the modified Bessel function of order zero.) A result that has appeared in the literature is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

One acceptable answer is therefore

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

Below we describe one route by which one may arrive at this answer.

1. A Brief Outline of One Way to Derive the Answer

A very general technique for evaluating integrals of the form

  I(n;λ,μ,…) = ∫₀∞ x⁽μ⁾ [Kₙ(x)]ᵖ dx

is to use an appropriate Mellin–Barnes representation (see, e.g., the classic tables of integrals by Gradstein & Ryshik or formulas found in papers by Bailey, Borwein, et al.). In our case one may proceed as follows.

Step (a): Write a representation for K₀(x). One well‐known representation is

  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt.
                  (1)

Thus one has

  [K₀(x)]⁴ = ∬…∫₀∞ exp[–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄)] dt₁ dt₂ dt₃ dt₄.

Step (b): Interchange integration (justified by absolute convergence) so that

  I = ∫₀∞ x·exp(–Ax) dx,  where A = cosh t₁+cosh t₂+cosh t₃+cosh t₄,
    = 1/A²       (since ∫₀∞ x e^(–Ax) dx = 1/A²).

Then

  I = ∬…∫₀∞ [1/(cosh t₁+cosh t₂+cosh t₃+cosh t₄)²] dt₁ dt₂ dt₃ dt₄.

Step (c): Finally one shows (by a combination of suitable changes of variables and an appeal to known multidimensional integrals or via a Mellin transform technique) that the four‐fold integral above may be written in closed–form; the answer one finds is equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

For further details one may consult, for example, some of the work on Bessel moments (see, e.g., Bailey et al.) where many integrals of this type are evaluated.

2. Numerical Approximation

A numerical evaluation of

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²)

using that Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119 and π ≈ 3.141592653589793 gives

  I ≈ 23.6679243000

(rounding to 10 decimal places).
