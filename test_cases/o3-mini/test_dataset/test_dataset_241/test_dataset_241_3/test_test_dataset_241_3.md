We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x J₁(x) I₁(x) Y₀(2x) K₀(2x) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here J and Y are the usual Bessel functions of first and second kind, and I and K are the modified Bessel functions.) One acceptable answer is

  I = 1⁄16 [ ψ(½) – ψ(1) ]            (1)

where ψ(z) is the digamma function. (Since ψ(1)= –γ and ψ(½)= –γ – 2 ln2, one has ψ(½)–ψ(1)= –2 ln2.)

A numerical evaluation then shows

  I = – (ln2)/8 ≈ –0.0866433972.

Below we describe one route to an answer.

Outline of one possible method:

1. One may first “separate” the integrals by writing the integrand as a product of two parts, namely
  A(x) = J₁(x)I₁(x) and B(x) = Y₀(2x)K₀(2x).
Although there is no easy factorization, one may show that by introducing a parameter in the orders and then differentiating under the integral sign one may relate the given integral to (derivatives of) integrals of the form

  ∫₀∞ x J_ν(x) Y_ν(2x) dx  and  ∫₀∞ x I_ν(x) K₀(2x) dx.

2. In our case one may show that if one defines
  F(ν) = ∫₀∞ x J_ν(x) I_ν(x) Y₀(2x)K₀(2x) dx,
then after some work one may differentiate with respect to ν and set ν=1. (One must use recurrences and differentiate the series representations; see, e.g., Gradstein‐Ryzhik.) In the end a combination of known integrals and some algebra shows that the answer can be written in closed‐form as (1).

3. Noticing that
  ψ(½) – ψ(1) = (–γ – 2 ln2) – (–γ) = –2 ln2,
we deduce
  I = –2 ln2/16 = – (ln2)/8.

4. A numerical evaluation gives –0.0866433972.

Any answer equivalent to (1) (or –(ln2)/8) is acceptable.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1⁄16)[ψ(½)–ψ(1)]       ≈ –0.0866433972.
