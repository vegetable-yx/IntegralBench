We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) ln(√(1–x) – √x) dx

can be expressed in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = – (π + 2)/8.

Below we describe one route to that answer.

Step 1. Make the substitution x = sin²θ.
• Then, dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
• When x = 0, θ = 0; when x = ½, sin²θ = ½ so that θ = π/4.
• Also note
  √(1 – x) = √(1 – sin²θ) = cosθ  and  √x = sinθ.
Thus the integrand becomes
  ln(√(1–x) – √x) = ln(cosθ – sinθ).

Then
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) ln(cosθ – sinθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Step 2. Write cosθ – sinθ in a “nice” form.
Since
  cosθ – sinθ = √2 cos(θ + π/4),
we may write
  ln(cosθ – sinθ) = ln(√2 cos(θ + π/4))
         = ½ ln2 + ln(cos(θ + π/4)).

So
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) [½ ln2 + ln(cos(θ + π/4))] · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
It is convenient to separate the integral:
  I = ln2 · ∫₀^(π/4) sinθ cosθ dθ + 2∫₀^(π/4) ln(cos(θ + π/4)) sinθ cosθ dθ.
The first integral is elementary. In fact, note that
  ∫₀^(π/4) sinθ cosθ dθ = ½∫₀^(π/4) sin2θ dθ.
Since
  ∫ sin2θ dθ = –½ cos2θ,
one easily finds
  ∫₀^(π/4) sin2θ dθ = –½[cos(π/2) – cos0] = –½[0 – 1] = ½,
and hence
  ∫₀^(π/4) sinθ cosθ dθ = ½ · ½ = ¼.
Thus the “ln2‐term” contributes (ln2)/4.

Step 3. A change of variable now cleans up the second integral.
Set
  u = θ + π/4.
Then when θ runs from 0 to π/4, u runs from π/4 to π/2.
Also writing sinθ cosθ in terms of u (note that θ = u – π/4) one may show (using standard trig identities) that
  sinθ cosθ dθ = –½ cos2u d u.
Thus the second term becomes
  2∫_(u=π/4)^(π/2) ln(cos u) · [–½ cos2u] du = –∫_(π/4)^(π/2) cos2u ln(cos u) du.
Call this term K so that
  I = (ln2)/4 – K            (1)

Step 4. One may show by other methods (for example, by writing cos2u = 2cos²u – 1 and using known integrals or by differentiating a suitable parameter–dependent integral) that
  K = (π + 2 + 2 ln2)/8.
Then from (1) one deduces
  I = (ln2)/4 – [(π + 2 + 2 ln2)/8]
     = [2 ln2 – (π + 2 + 2 ln2)]/8
     = – (π + 2)/8.

(There are several routes to evaluate K. One acceptable answer is the answer stated above.)

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
Now,
  I = – (π + 2)/8 ≈ – (3.1415926536 + 2)/8 ≈ – 5.1415926536/8 ≈ – 0.6426990817.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the numerical value is –0.6426990817.

Thus, the final answer is given in exact form as –(π+2)/8 and numerically approximately –0.6426990817.

Finally, we output the result in the requested JSON format:
