We wish to compute

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [ln(sin x)]⁄[cos² x] dx.

A very efficient strategy is to use integration by parts. To do so, we set

  u = ln(sin x)  and  dv = dx/cos² x.

Then we need to compute du and v:

1. Differentiate u:
  u = ln(sin x) ⟹ du = (cos x/sin x) dx = cot x dx.
2. Integrate dv:
  dv = dx/cos² x ⟹ v = ∫ dx/cos² x = tan x,
 since d/dx(tan x) = 1/cos² x.

Now, the integration‐by‐parts formula gives:
  I = [u · v] evaluated from 0 to π/2 – ∫₀^(π/2) v du
    = [ln(sin x) tan x]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) tan x · cot x dx.

Notice that tan x · cot x = 1 (for x where both are defined). Thus,
  I = [ln(sin x) tan x]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) 1 dx
    = [ln(sin x) tan x]₀^(π/2) – (π/2).

We now evaluate the boundary term [ln(sin x) tan x] from x=0 to x=π/2.

At x = π/2:
 sin(π/2) = 1 so ln(sin(π/2)) = 0, and tan(π/2) is infinite.
Thus we must take a limit as x → π/2. Let t = (π/2 – x) so that when x → π/2, t → 0.
 Then,
  tan x = tan(π/2 – t) = cot t ≈ 1/t  (for small t),
  ln(sin x) = ln(sin(π/2 – t)) = ln(cos t) ≈ ln(1 – t²/2) ≈ –t²/2.
So their product behaves as
  ln(sin x) tan x ≈ (–t²/2) · (1/t) = –t/2 → 0.
Thus the contribution at x = π/2 is 0.

At x = 0:
 sin x → 0 so ln(sin x) → –∞ and tan x → 0.
Using the limit as x → 0, sin x ≈ x and tan x ≈ x, so
  ln(sin x) tan x ≈ ln(x) · x → 0,
because x ln x → 0 as x → 0.

Thus, the boundary term evaluates to 0 – 0 = 0.

So the integral becomes:
  I = 0 – (π/2) = –π/2.

For the numerical approximation, note that
  –π/2 ≈ –1.5707963268  (rounded to 10 decimal places).
