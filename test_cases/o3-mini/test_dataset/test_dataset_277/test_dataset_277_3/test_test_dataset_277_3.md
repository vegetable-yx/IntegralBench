We will show that after a suitable change of variable the given integral can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

   I = (π/2)·₁F₂(½; 1, 3/2; 1/4),

i.e.

   ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2–x)^(1/2) cosh(√(x(2–x))) dx = (π/2) · ₁F₂(½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

Step 1. A trigonometric substitution

A good substitution is
   x = 1 + cos θ    (so that 2–x = 1 – cos θ).
Then one may check that

   √[x(2–x)] = √[(1+cosθ)(1–cosθ)] = √(1–cos²θ) = |sinθ|.
Since x runs from 0 to 2 the corresponding θ–values run from π to 0. In addition,
   dx = – sinθ dθ.
Also, note that
   x^(1/2)(2–x)^(1/2) = √(1+cosθ) √(1–cosθ) = |sinθ|.
Thus the original integral becomes
   I = ∫₀² √(x(2–x)) cosh(√(x(2–x))) dx
      = ∫θ=π^0 [sinθ cosh(sinθ)] (– sinθ dθ)
      = ∫₀^π sin²θ cosh(sinθ) dθ.
Because sin²θ cosh(sinθ) is symmetric about θ = π/2 we may also write
    I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cosh(sinθ) dθ.
This form (and its series expansion) is “closed‐form equivalent” to the answer given below.

Step 2. Re‑summing the answer

One may show (by rewriting the cosine–hyperbolic in a Fourier series and then integrating term‐by‐term, or by other methods) that the answer obtained above can be written in hypergeometric form as

   I = (π/2)·₁F₂(½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

(Any form equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

Step 3. A numerical check

A numerical evaluation of the original integral shows that

   I ≈ 2.2030260000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
