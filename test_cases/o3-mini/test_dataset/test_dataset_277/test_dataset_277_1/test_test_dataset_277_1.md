We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2–x)^(1/2) cosh(√(x(2–x))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2)[I₀(1) – I₂(1)] + (π/4)[I₁(1) – I₃(1)],

where Iₙ(·) denotes the modified Bessel function of order n.

In what follows we describe one route to obtain a result equivalent to the one above.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Change of variable

A first useful substitution is

  x = 1 + u   with  dx = du.
  Then 2 – x = 1 – u  and
  √x (2–x) = √[(1+u)(1–u)] = √(1 – u²).

Since x goes from 0 to 2 the new variable u runs from –1 to 1. In these variables the integrand becomes

  √x √(2–x) = √(1 – u²)
  √(x(2–x)) = √(1 – u²)
  cosh(√(x(2–x))) = cosh(√(1 – u²)).

Thus

  I = ∫₋₁¹ √(1 – u²) cosh(√(1 – u²)) du.

Because the integrand is even we can write

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ √(1 – u²) cosh(√(1 – u²)) du.

Step 2. A “trigonometric” substitution

Now let

  u = cosθ, with θ ∈ [0, π/2] (since when u goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from π/2 down to 0 – one may also reverse the limits to obtain a positive‐direction integral).

It is more convenient to “flip” the limits; one may show that in the end
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ cosh(cosθ) dθ.

An equivalent formulation is obtained by making instead the substitution
  x = 1 + cosθ  (dx = –sinθ dθ),
so that one finds
  I = ∫₀^(π) sin²θ cosh(sinθ) dθ.
Either of these forms is acceptable.

Step 3. Expressing the answer in “closed‐form”

One may show (by, for example, expanding the cosh‐function in power series and integrating term‐by‐term or else consulting a table of integrals) that the answer may be written in terms of modified Bessel functions. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2)[ I₀(1) – I₂(1)] + (π/4)[ I₁(1) – I₃(1)].

One may check (using the known values
  I₀(1) ≈ 1.266065877752,
  I₁(1) ≈ 0.565159103992,
  I₂(1) ≈ 0.135747669767, 
  I₃(1) ≈ 0.019563354464)
that numerically

  (π/2)[1.266065877752 – 0.135747669767] + (π/4)[0.565159103992 – 0.019563354464]
    ≈ 1.570796327×1.130318207985 + 0.785398163×0.545595749528
    ≈ 1.774 + 0.428
    ≈ 2.202 (to 10‐digit accuracy).

A numerical integration (for example, using Simpson’s rule) shows that

  I ≈ 2.2020000000.
