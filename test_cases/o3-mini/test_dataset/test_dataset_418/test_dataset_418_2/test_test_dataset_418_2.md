We start by writing the integral as a sum over intervals where the ceiling function remains constant. For x in the interval [n – 1, n] with n ∈ ℕ (n ≥ 1), we have:
  • ⌈x⌉ = n,
  • {x} = x – (n – 1).

Changing the variable to u = x – (n – 1) (so that u ∈ [0, 1]), we get dx = du and the integrand becomes:
  { x }^(⌈x⌉) / (1 + ⌈x⌉) = u^n / (1 + n).

Thus, the integral becomes a sum:
  I = Σₙ₌₁^∞ ∫₀¹ [u^n / (1+n)] du.

Since ∫₀¹ u^n du = 1/(n+1), we get:
  I = Σₙ₌₁^∞ [1 / (n+1)] * [1 / (n+1)] = Σₙ₌₁^∞ 1/(n+1)².

By changing the index (let m = n + 1), the sum becomes:
  I = Σₘ₌₂^∞ 1/m² = ζ(2) – 1,
where ζ(2) = π²/6.

Thus, the exact answer is:
  I = π²/6 – 1.

Numerically, we have:
  π²/6 ≈ 1.6449340668 ⇒ I ≈ 1.6449340668 – 1 = 0.6449340668.
