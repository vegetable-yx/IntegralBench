We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ [x / (eˣ - 1)] dx.

Step 1. Write the series representation for 1/(eˣ - 1):

  1/(eˣ - 1) = Σₙ₌₁∞ e⁻ⁿˣ, (for x > 0).

So the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀∞ x (Σₙ₌₁∞ e⁻ⁿˣ) dx
    = Σₙ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x e⁻ⁿˣ dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the inner integral. Recall that

  ∫₀∞ x e⁻ᵃˣ dx = 1/a²  (for a > 0).

Taking a = n, we have

  ∫₀∞ x e⁻ⁿˣ dx = 1/n².

Thus,

  I = Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/n² = ζ(2).

Step 3. It is known that ζ(2) = π²/6. Therefore, the exact answer is

  I = π²/6.

Step 4. The numerical value is computed as follows. π² ≈ 9.869604401089358, so

  I ≈ 9.869604401089358/6 ≈ 1.6449340668482264.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this becomes 1.6449340668.

Thus, the final result is:

{"answer": "\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}", "numerical_answer": "1.6449340668"}
