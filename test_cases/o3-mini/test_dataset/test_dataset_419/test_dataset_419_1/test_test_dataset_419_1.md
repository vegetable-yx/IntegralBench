We start by expressing the integrand as a series. Notice that

  1/(e^x − 1) = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ e^(−nx).

Hence the integral becomes

  ∫₀∞ [x/(e^x − 1)] dx = ∫₀∞ x (∑ₙ₌₁∞ e^(−nx)) dx = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x e^(−nx) dx.

We can interchange the sum and the integral for convergence reasons. Now, evaluate the inner integral. For n > 0, we have

  ∫₀∞ x e^(−nx) dx = 1/n².

Thus, the sum becomes

  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/n² = ζ(2).

It is known that ζ(2) = π²/6. Therefore, the exact value of the integral is

  ∫₀∞ [x/(e^x − 1)] dx = π²/6.

For the numerical approximation, note that

  π² ≈ 9.8696044011,
  π²/6 ≈ 1.64493406685.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is 1.6449340669.
