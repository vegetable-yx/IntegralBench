We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₁ᵉ (cos(ln x))/x dx.

Step 1. Change of variable:
Let u = ln x. Then, the derivative du/dx = 1/x, or equivalently, dx = x du. Also, when x = 1, u = ln 1 = 0 and when x = e, u = ln e = 1.

Substituting into the integral:
  I = ∫ (cos u)/x · x du = ∫ cos u du,
with new limits from u = 0 to u = 1.

Step 2. Integrate with respect to u:
The integral of cos u is sin u, so
  I = sin u |₀¹ = sin(1) – sin(0).

Since sin(0) = 0, we have:
  I = sin(1).

Step 3. Numerical approximation:
Using a calculator, sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848 (to 10 decimal places).

Thus, the final answer is:

{"answer": "\\sin(1)", "numerical_answer": "0.8414709848"}
