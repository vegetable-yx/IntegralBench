We start by writing the function inside the absolute value as
  x³ - x = x(x² - 1) = x(x - 1)(x + 1).

Its zeros are at x = –1, 0, and 1. These are the points where the sign of x³ - x may change.

Step 1. Determine the sign of x³ – x in the various intervals:
 • For x < –1, for example x = –2:
  (–2)³ – (–2) = –8 + 2 = –6 (negative).
 • For –1 < x < 0, for example x = –0.5:
  (–0.125) – (–0.5) = 0.375 (positive).
 • For 0 < x < 1, for example x = 0.5:
  0.125 – 0.5 = –0.375 (negative).
 • For x > 1, for example x = 2:
  8 – 2 = 6 (positive).

Thus,
 • On [–4, –1] the function is negative so |x³ – x| = –(x³ – x) = –x³ + x.
 • On [–1, 0] it is positive so |x³ – x| = x³ – x.
 • On [0, 1] it is negative so |x³ – x| = -(x³ – x) = x – x³.
 • On [1, 4] it is positive so |x³ – x| = x³ – x.

Note that since x³ – x is an odd function, its absolute value |x³ – x| is even. Therefore, we can simplify the integral over [–4, 4] by computing twice the integral over [0, 4]:
  ∫₋₄⁴ |x³ – x| dx = 2 ∫₀⁴ |x³ – x| dx.

Since the sign changes at x = 1 in the interval [0, 4], we break the integral into two pieces:
  2 [ ∫₀¹ (x – x³) dx + ∫₁⁴ (x³ – x) dx ].

Step 2. Evaluate the integrals separately.

For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1:
  ∫₀¹ (x – x³) dx = [x²/2 – x⁴/4]₀¹ = (½ – ¼) = ¼.

For 1 ≤ x ≤ 4:
  ∫₁⁴ (x³ – x) dx = [x⁴/4 – x²/2]₁⁴.
Evaluate at x = 4:
  (4⁴)/4 – (4²)/2 = 256/4 – 16/2 = 64 – 8 = 56.
Evaluate at x = 1:
  (1⁴)/4 – (1²)/2 = ¼ – ½ = –¼.
Thus,
  ∫₁⁴ (x³ – x) dx = 56 – (–¼) = 56 + ¼ = 225/4.

Now add the segments:
  ∫₀⁴ |x³ – x| dx = ¼ + 225/4 = (1 + 225)/4 = 226/4 = 113/2.

Multiplying by 2 to account for symmetry:
  ∫₋₄⁴ |x³ – x| dx = 2 × (113/2) = 113.

Step 3. Numerical approximation:
  113.0000000000 (rounded to ten decimal places).
