We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₋₄⁴ |x³ – x| dx.

Step 1. Find the zeros of the inside function:
  x³ – x = x (x² – 1) = 0 ⟹ x = –1, 0, 1.

Step 2. Determine the sign of f(x) = x³ – x on each interval:
 • For x ∈ [–4, –1]: Choose x = –2 → (–8 + 2 = –6) negative.
 • For x ∈ [–1, 0]: Choose x = –0.5 → ((–0.125) + 0.5 = 0.375) positive.
 • For x ∈ [0, 1]: Choose x = 0.5 → (0.125 – 0.5 = –0.375) negative.
 • For x ∈ [1, 4]: Choose x = 2 → (8 – 2 = 6) positive.

Thus, the absolute value of the function is given by:
  |x³ – x| =
    –(x³ – x) = –x³ + x  on [–4, –1] and [0, 1],
    x³ – x      on [–1, 0] and [1, 4].

Step 3. Write the integral as a sum:
  I = ∫₋₄⁻¹ (–x³ + x) dx +
    ∫₋₁⁰ (x³ – x) dx +
    ∫₀¹ (–x³ + x) dx +
    ∫₁⁴ (x³ – x) dx.

Step 4. Compute the antiderivatives:
 For F₁(x) = ∫ (–x³ + x) dx = –(x⁴/4) + (x²/2).
 For F₂(x) = ∫ (x³ – x) dx = x⁴/4 – (x²/2).

Now, evaluate in pieces:

1. I₁ from x = –4 to –1:
 F₁(–1) = –((–1)⁴/4) + ((–1)²/2) = –(1/4) + (1/2) = 1/4.
 F₁(–4) = –(256/4) + (16/2) = –64 + 8 = –56.
 I₁ = F₁(–1) – F₁(–4) = 1/4 – (–56) = 1/4 + 56 = (1 + 224)/4 = 225/4.

2. I₂ from x = –1 to 0:
 F₂(0) = 0⁴/4 – 0²/2 = 0.
 F₂(–1) = (1/4) – (1/2) = –1/4.
 I₂ = F₂(0) – F₂(–1) = 0 – (–1/4) = 1/4.

3. I₃ from x = 0 to 1:
 F₁(1) = –(1/4) + (1/2) = 1/4.
 F₁(0) = 0.
 I₃ = F₁(1) – F₁(0) = 1/4.

4. I₄ from x = 1 to 4:
 F₂(4) = (256/4) – (16/2) = 64 – 8 = 56.
 F₂(1) = (1/4) – (1/2) = –1/4.
 I₄ = F₂(4) – F₂(1) = 56 – (–1/4) = 56 + 1/4 = (224 + 1)/4 = 225/4.

Step 5. Sum up the four parts:
  I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ + I₄ = (225/4) + (1/4) + (1/4) + (225/4)
        = (225 + 1 + 1 + 225)/4 = 452/4 = 113.

Thus, the exact value of the integral is 113.

Step 6. Numerical approximation:
  113.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).

Finally, the result in the required JSON format is:

{"answer": "$113$", "numerical_answer": "113.0000000000"}
