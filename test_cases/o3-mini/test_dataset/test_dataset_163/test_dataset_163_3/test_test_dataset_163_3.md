We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀∞ [x²/(eˣ–1)]·[2³sinh(½x) – sinh(¼x)] dx
can be written in closed‐form in terms of the Riemann and Hurwitz zeta functions.

Step 1. Write the integrand in series form

Since
  1/(eˣ–1) = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ e^(–nx)
(for x > 0) we may interchange summation and integration (by uniform convergence) so that

  I = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x² e^(–nx) [8 sinh(½x) – sinh(¼x)] dx.

We define for a given real a (with n > a so that the integrals converge)
  I(n,a) = ∫₀∞ x² e^(–nx) sinh(ax) dx.
Using the definition
  sinh(ax) = (e^(ax) – e^(–ax))/2,
we obtain
  I(n,a) = (1/2) [∫₀∞ x² e^(–(n–a)x) dx – ∫₀∞ x² e^(–(n+a)x) dx].
But a standard formula gives
  ∫₀∞ x² e^(–px) dx = 2/p³  (for p > 0).
Thus,
  I(n,a) = (1/2)[2/(n–a)³ – 2/(n+a)³] = 1/(n–a)³ – 1/(n+a)³.

So the original integral becomes

  I = 8 ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/(n–½)³ – 1/(n+½)³] – ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/(n–¼)³ – 1/(n+¼)³].

Step 2. Express the sums in terms of Hurwitz zeta functions

Recall that for s > 1 and a not a negative integer
  ζ(s,a) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/(n+a)ˢ.
In our sums the index n starts at 1 so that, for example,
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n–d)³ = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m+1–d)³ = ζ(3,1–d).
Thus, we can write

  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n–½)³ = ζ(3,1–½) = ζ(3,½),
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+½)³ = ζ(3,1+½) = ζ(3,3/2),
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n–¼)³ = ζ(3,1–¼) = ζ(3,3/4),
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+¼)³ = ζ(3,1+¼) = ζ(3,5/4).

Therefore, our original integral is

  I = 8[ζ(3,½) – ζ(3,3/2)] – [ζ(3,3/4) – ζ(3,5/4)].

It is also known that ζ(3,½) = (2³ – 1) ζ(3) = 7 ζ(3) so that an equivalent answer is

  I = 56 ζ(3) – 8 ζ(3,3/2) – ζ(3,3/4) + ζ(3,5/4).

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using standard numerical values (with Apéry’s constant ζ(3) ≈ 1.202056903159594)
and numerical approximations for the Hurwitz zeta functions one finds that

  I ≈ 62.0149665770  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).
