We begin by considering the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [cos(x) / (2 - cos²(x))] dx.

Step 1. Use the substitution:
  Let u = sin(x). Then, the derivative is du = cos(x) dx.
  When x = 0, u = sin(0) = 0; and when x = π/2, u = sin(π/2) = 1.
Thus, the integral becomes:
  I = ∫₀¹ [1 / (2 - cos²(x))] du.

Step 2. Express cos²(x) in terms of u:
  Using the identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1, we have cos²(x) = 1 - sin²(x) = 1 - u².
Substitute this into the denominator:
  2 - cos²(x) = 2 - (1 - u²) = 1 + u².

Now the integral is:
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+u²)] du.

Step 3. Compute the integral:
  The antiderivative of 1/(1+u²) is arctan(u). Therefore,
  I = [arctan(u)] from 0 to 1 = arctan(1) - arctan(0) = (π/4) - 0 = π/4.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
  The numerical approximation for π/4 is approximately 0.7853981634 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
