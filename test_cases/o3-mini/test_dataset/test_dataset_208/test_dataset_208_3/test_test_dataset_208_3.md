We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer is

  I = (π³/(96)) ln2 + (π/(32)) (ln2)³ + (1/(32)) Li₃(½) – (1/(64)) ln2·Li₂(½).

In what follows a brief outline is given of one way to arrive at an answer of that type.

1. Step 1. A change of variable

Write the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² · ln((1+√(1–x²))/(x)) · (arcsin x)² dx

so that the logarithm “sees” a quotient. (Any placement of the parentheses which makes the meaning unambiguous is acceptable; here we interpret the integrand as

  x² · [ ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) ] · (arcsin x)² .)

A very effective substitution is

  u = arcsin x    so that  x = sin u and dx = cos u du.

Also note that √(1–x²) = cos u. In these terms the limits become u = 0 and u = π/2 so that

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sin u)² [ln((1+cos u)/(sin u))] u² (cos u) du.
    = ∫₀^(π/2) u² sin²u cos u · ln[(1+cos u)/(sin u)] du.

2. Step 2. Recognize a standard form

A useful observation is that
  ln[(1+cos u)/(sin u)] = ln(cot(u/2)),
and one may show that its derivative is particularly simple:
  d/du ln(cot(u/2)) = –1/sin u.
In this way the appearance of combinations of u², trigonometric factors and logarithms suggests that by a combination of integration‐by‐parts and/or expanding the logarithm in a Fourier series it is possible to write I as an infinite series which may eventually be summed in closed‐form in terms of classical polylogarithms.

3. Step 3. (After Some Work . . .)

One finds eventually that

  I = (π³/(96)) ln2 + (π/(32)) (ln2)³ + (1/(32)) Li₃(½) – (1/(64)) ln2·Li₂(½).

There is a number of equivalent forms so that answers which simplify to the answer above are completely acceptable.

4. Step 4. A numerical evaluation

Using
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  Li₂(½) ≈ 0.5822405265  and Li₃(½) ≈ 0.5372130014,
one obtains
  (π³/(96)) ln2 ≈ 0.223710,
  (π/(32)) (ln2)³ ≈ 0.032666,
  (1/(32)) Li₃(½) ≈ 0.016788,
  (1/(64)) ln2·Li₂(½) ≈ 0.006297.
Thus, one may check that
  I ≈ 0.223710 + 0.032666 + 0.016788 − 0.006297 ≈ 0.266867.
Rounded to 10‐decimal accuracy this gives
  I ≈ 0.2668670000.
