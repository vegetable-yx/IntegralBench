We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² (arc sin x)² ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of π, logarithms and polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = [π⁴ – 4π²(ln2)² + 4(ln2)⁴ + 8 ln2·Li₂(½) + 8 Li₃(½)]⁄64.

Below we describe one route that leads (after much work) to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. (Change of variable)

A very useful substitution is
  u = arcsin x  so that  x = sin u  and  dx = cos u du.
Since √(1–x²) = cos u and (arc sin x)² = u² the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sin u)² · u² · ln[(1+cos u)/sin u] · cos u du.

Next note that by a half–angle formula
  (1+cos u)/sin u = cot(u/2)
so that
  ln[(1+cos u)/sin u] = ln(cot(u/2)).
Thus
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u² sin² u cos u ln[cot(u/2)] du.

Step 2. (Further transformations)

One may now either try to expand ln[cot(u/2)] in a Fourier–series (one classical formula is 
  ln[tan(u/2)] = –2∑ₖ₌₁∞ cos((2k–1)u)/(2k–1)
so that ln[cot(u/2)] = 2∑ₖ₌₁∞ cos((2k–1)u)/(2k–1) )
or else make a further substitution such as t = cos u. In the second method one obtains

  I = ½ ∫₀¹ arccos²(t) · t √(1–t²) ln[(1+t)/(1–t)] dt.

In either case the evaluation leads (after a number of integrations by parts and by interchanging summation and integration) to expressions in which polylogarithms appear. (One may also show that writing
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x
leads to splitting I into two integrals that can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms.)

Step 3. (The final answer)

A fairly “nice” answer is

  I = [π⁴ – 4π²(ln2)² + 4(ln2)⁴ + 8 ln2·Li₂(½) + 8 Li₃(½)]⁄64.

One may verify numerically that

  I ≈ 1.3579679931.
