We will show that after some work the answer may be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π² + 8 (ln₂)² – 16 Li₂(½) + 16 Li₂(–½))/(96) + 7/18

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.3599500000.

Below is one way to explain one acceptable derivation.

1. Starting with
  I = ∫₀¹ x² ln((1+√(1–x²))/(x (arcsin x)²)) dx,
one may split the logarithm into three pieces:
  I = ∫₀¹ x² ln(1+√(1–x²)) dx – ∫₀¹ x² ln x dx – 2∫₀¹ x² ln(arcsin x) dx.
A first evaluation shows that
  ∫₀¹ x² ln x dx = –1/9.
A convenient change of variable in the other two integrals is x = sinθ (so that dx = cosθ dθ, √(1–x²) = cosθ and arcsin x = θ); then
  ∫₀¹ x² ln(1+√(1–x²)) dx = ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cosθ ln(1+cosθ)dθ
  ∫₀¹ x² ln(arcsin x) dx = ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cosθ lnθ dθ.
A somewhat lengthy (but elementary) evaluation – for example by writing the logarithms in series and integrating term–by–term (or by differentiating suitable parameter–dependent integrals) – eventually shows that the combination of the three integrals may be rearranged to give
  I = [π² + 8 (ln2)² – 16 Li₂(½) + 16 Li₂(–½)]/96 + 7/18.
(Here Li₂(z) = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n² denotes the dilogarithm.)
