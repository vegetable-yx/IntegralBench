We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from x=–1 to 1 [ sin(√x) / (sinh(√x) + sin(√x)) ] dx.

Because the square root function for negative x will be complex, it is convenient to split the integration domain into two parts: one for x ≥ 0 (where √x is real) and one for x < 0 (where we interpret √x as having its principal complex value).

Step 1. Write I as the sum

  I = I₁ + I₂,   where
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ [ sin(√x) / (sinh(√x) + sin(√x)) ] dx,
  I₂ = ∫₋₁⁰ [ sin(√x) / (sinh(√x) + sin(√x)) ] dx.

Step 2. Deal with I₂ (x from –1 to 0).
Let x = –t with t running from 0 to 1. Then dx = – dt. The substitution gives
  √x = √(–t) = i√t,
where the principal branch is used.

Thus, using the standard identities
  sin(i a) = i sinh(a)  and  sinh(i a) = i sin(a),
we have
  sin(√x) = sin(i√t) = i sinh(√t),
  sinh(√x) = sinh(i√t) = i sin(√t).

Substituting into the integrand:
  [ sin(√x) / (sinh(√x) + sin(√x)) ] becomes
    [i sinh(√t)] / [i sin(√t) + i sinh(√t)]
    = sinh(√t) / [sin(√t) + sinh(√t)].

Also, under x = –t the limits change from t=1 (when x = –1) to t=0 (when x = 0), and the minus sign from dx reverses the order back to t=0 to 1. Hence,
  I₂ = ∫₀¹ [ sinh(√t) / (sin(√t) + sinh(√t)) ] dt.

Step 3. Change variable in both integrals to “u” by letting u = √(·).
For I₁: Let x = u² so that when x runs from 0 to 1, u runs from 0 to 1. Then dx = 2u du, and
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ [ sin(u) / (sinh(u) + sin(u)) ] · 2u du
    = 2∫₀¹ [ u sin(u) / (sinh(u) + sin(u)) ] du.

For I₂: In the t-integral use the substitution t = u²; here when t runs from 0 to 1, u runs from 0 to 1, and dt = 2u du. Then
  I₂ = ∫₀¹ [ sinh(u) / (sin(u) + sinh(u)) ] · 2u du
    = 2∫₀¹ [ u sinh(u) / (sin(u) + sinh(u)) ] du.

Step 4. Combine I₁ and I₂:
  I = I₁ + I₂ = 2∫₀¹ u [ sin(u) / (sinh(u) + sin(u)) + sinh(u) / (sinh(u) + sin(u)) ] du.
Observe that the sum in the integrand becomes
  [ sin(u) + sinh(u) ] / [sin(u) + sinh(u)] = 1.
Hence,
  I = 2∫₀¹ u du = 2 · [½ u²] evaluated from 0 to 1 = 1² – 0 = 1.

Step 5. Write the exact result and provide a numerical approximation.
The exact answer is 1 and numerically this is 1.0000000000.
