We start with the integral

  I = ∫₋₁⁰ 5(x⁶ + x)⁴ dx.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand by factoring:
  x⁶ + x = x(x⁵ + 1).

Thus,
  (x⁶ + x)⁴ = [x(x⁵ + 1)]⁴ = x⁴ (x⁵ + 1)⁴.

So the integral becomes:
  I = 5∫₋₁⁰ x⁴ (x⁵ + 1)⁴ dx.

Step 2. Use the substitution:
  Let t = x⁵ + 1.
  Then dt/dx = 5x⁴ ⟹ dt = 5x⁴ dx ⟹ x⁴ dx = dt/5.

Determine the new limits:
  When x = –1: t = (–1)⁵ + 1 = –1 + 1 = 0.
  When x = 0: t = 0⁵ + 1 = 1.

Thus, the integral becomes:
  I = 5∫ₜ₌₀¹ (t)⁴ · (dt/5) = ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt.

Step 3. Evaluate the new integral:
  ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt = [t⁵/5]₀¹ = 1/5 – 0 = 1/5.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
  1/5 = 0.2, and rounded to 10 decimal places, it is 0.2000000000.
