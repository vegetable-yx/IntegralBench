We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(4√(2π)))·[ψ(5/4) – ψ(3/4)]    (1)

where
 • Γ(·) is the Gamma–function, and
 • ψ(·) is the digamma–function (that is, ψ(z) = d/dz ln Γ(z)). 

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.3638194653.

Below we describe one route that leads (after some clever changes of order of integration and series summation) to an answer equivalent to (1). (Any method that leads – after proper justification – to an answer equivalent to (1) is acceptable.)

Step 1. One may start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln((1 + 0.5√x)/(1 – 0.5√x)) K(√(1 – x)) dx,
                (2)

where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. (It is sometimes convenient to change the variable by writing u = √x so that (2) becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ u ln((1 + 0.5 u)/(1 – 0.5 u)) K(√(1 – u²)) du.)

Step 2. One may then introduce a “parameter‐differentiation” device. For example, define

  I(a) = ∫₀¹ ln((1 + a√x)/(1 – a√x)) K(√(1 – x)) dx , 0 ≤ a < 1.
                     (3)

A short calculation shows that
  d/da ln((1 + a√x)/(1 – a√x)) = 2√x/(1 – a² x).

Thus
  I′(a) = 2∫₀¹ (√x/(1 – a²x)) K(√(1 – x)) dx.
Writing 1/(1 – a²x) as a power–series and interchanging summation and integration produces (after some work) a series for I′(a) which may be integrated (with I(0)=0) back in the parameter a. In our case one may show that when a = 0.5 the answer (after some further transformations, and using standard summation formulas – see, e.g., formulas 8.36.8 and 8.36.9 in the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions) may be written in the form (1).

Step 3. One may check (by using known values for Γ(1/4) and ψ(5/4) – ψ(3/4)) that an equivalent answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(4√(2π)))·[ψ(5/4) – ψ(3/4)]   (1)
 with numerical value approximately 1.3638194653.

Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct.

For example, one acceptable final answer (in our desired JSON format) is:

{"answer": "\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\Bigl[\\psi(5/4)-\\psi(3/4)\\Bigr]", "numerical_answer": "1.3638194653"}
