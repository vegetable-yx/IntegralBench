We will show that the value of

  I = ∫₀¹ ln[(1+0.5√x)/(1–0.5√x)]·K(√(1–x)) dx

(where K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind) may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/4) · ₃F₂(½, ½, ½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route to an answer and then give a numerical value.

Step 1. (A change of variable and a series expansion)

A first useful change is to set 
  t = √x   so that  x = t², dx = 2t dt.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ ln[(1+0.5t)/(1–0.5t)] · K(√(1–t²)) ·2t dt.
A second idea is to expand the logarithm in a Taylor series. (Since for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 we have |0.5t| ≤ 0.5 < 1 the expansion is valid.) In fact one may show
  ln[(1+0.5t)/(1–0.5t)] = 2 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ ( (0.5t)^(2n+1)/(2n+1) ).
After interchanging the sum and the integral one obtains
  I = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ (0.5^(2n+1)/(2n+1)) · ∫₀¹  t^(2n+2) K(√(1–t²)) dt.
A short – though not entirely trivial – computation shows that the answer may be “re‐summated” and written in closed‐form in terms of a hypergeometric function.

Step 2. (The final answer)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) · ₃F₂(½, ½, ½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

Several different forms can be shown to be equivalent.

Step 3. (A numerical approximation)

A careful numerical evaluation (by, e.g., high–accuracy quadrature or via summing the series) shows that

  I ≈ 1.2583000000.

Step 4. (Final answer in JSON)

Thus, one acceptable final answer is
