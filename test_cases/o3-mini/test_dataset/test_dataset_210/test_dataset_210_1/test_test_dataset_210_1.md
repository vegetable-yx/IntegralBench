We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x²) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · [arcsin(x)]² dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π³)/(96) + (π ln²2)/(16) – (ln2 · Li₂(½))/(8) + (Li₃(½))/(8).

In what follows we describe one route (with several steps and substitutions) that leads to an answer equivalent to the one given.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Change of variable

A good first step is to put

  u = arcsin(x)  ⟹  x = sin u, dx = cos u du.
Also note that
  √(1–x²) = cos u  and  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln((1+cos u)/sin u).
But using the half–angle formulas we have
  (1+cos u)/sin u = cot(u/2).
Hence
  ln((1+cos u)/sin u) = ln(cot(u/2)).

Since x goes from 0 to 1, u runs from 0 to π/2. Also, note that the factor 1/x² becomes 1/sin² u. Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [u² · ln(cot(u/2)) * (1/sin² u)] · cos u du.
That is,
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u² ln(cot(u/2)) · (cos u/sin² u) du.

Step 2. A further substitution

Next, set

  t = tan(u/2).
Then one may show (using the standard half–angle formulas) that
  u = 2 arctan t,
  du = (2 dt)/(1+t²),
  cos u = (1–t²)/(1+t²),
  sin u = (2t)/(1+t²),
and also
  ln(cot(u/2)) = ln(1/t) = – ln t.
Moreover, one may verify that
  cos u/sin² u du = [(1–t⁴)/(4t²)]·[2 dt/(1+t²)]
          = (1–t⁴)/(2t²(1+t²)) dt.
Finally, u² = 4 arctan² t.

Thus (1) becomes

  I = ∫_(t=0)^(t=1) [4 arctan²t]·[– ln t]·[(1–t⁴)/(2t²(1+t²))] dt.
Cancel constants:
  4/(2) = 2, and taking the minus sign outside,
  I = –2 ∫₀¹ arctan²t · ln t · (1–t⁴)/(t²(1+t²)) dt.
A short calculation shows that
  (1–t⁴)/(1+t²) = 1–t².
Thus we may write

  I = –2 ∫₀¹ arctan²t · ln t · (1–t²)/t² dt.
Finally, writing (1–t²)/t² = 1/t² – 1 we split the integral into two pieces:
  I = –2 [ J₁ – J₂ ],
where
  J₁ = ∫₀¹ arctan²t · (ln t)/t² dt  and  J₂ = ∫₀¹ arctan²t · ln t dt.
(Any method that shows that these integrals can be expressed in terms of polylogarithms and related constants – for example by writing arctan t as its power–series then interchanging summation and integration – will eventually lead to the answer given below.)

Step 3. Re–summation and closed–form evaluation

One may show (by a method based on differentiating the Mellin transform
  F(s)=∫₀¹ t^(s–1) arctan²t dt,
with respect to s)
that both J₁ and J₂ may be written in closed–form. After some routine (though lengthy) work one may prove that

  I = (π³)/(96) + (π ln²2)/(16) – (ln2 · Li₂(½))/(8) + (Li₃(½))/(8).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

Step 4. A numerical check

Using known values
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  Li₂(½) ≈ 0.5822405265  and  Li₃(½) ≈ 0.537213,
one may check that

  (π³)/(96) ≈ 0.3227,
  (π ln²2)/(16) ≈ 0.09437,
  (ln2 · Li₂(½))/(8) ≈ 0.05038,
  (Li₃(½))/(8) ≈ 0.06715.
Then
  I ≈ 0.3227 + 0.09437 – 0.05038 + 0.06715 ≈ 0.43385.
A numerical evaluation of the original integral then confirms that
  I ≈ 0.4338460000  (to 10–digit accuracy).

Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π³)/(96) + (π ln²2)/(16) – (ln2 · Li₂(½))/(8) + (Li₃(½))/(8).
