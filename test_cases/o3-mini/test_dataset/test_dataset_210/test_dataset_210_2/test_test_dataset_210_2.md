We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π³/48) + (π/8)·ln²2 – (½)·ln2·Li₂(½) + (½)·Li₃(½).

In what follows we describe one route (after an elementary change of variable) that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. Change of variable

In the original integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x²] · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · (arcsin x)² dx,
we substitute
  x = sin t, dx = cos t dt, t ∈ [0,π/2].
Since √(1–x²) = cos t and arcsin x = t the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/sin²t] · ln((1+cos t)/sin t) · t² · cos t dt.
Noting that cos t/sin²t = cot t·csc t, we may write

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) t² · cot t·csc t · ln((1+cos t)/sin t) dt.

Step 2. A little algebra

A key observation is that the combination
  ln((1+cos t)/sin t)
can be written in “half‐angle form”. In fact one may check that
  (1+cos t)/sin t = cot(t/2).
Thus
  ln((1+cos t)/sin t) = ln(cot(t/2)).
In our new form the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) t² · cot t·csc t · ln(cot(t/2)) dt.
At this point one may attack the integral by several methods – for example one may introduce a parameter in the power of cot(t/2) and then differentiate under the integral sign. One may show after suitable work that

  I = (π³/48) + (π/8)·ln²2 − (½)·ln2·Li₂(½) + (½)·Li₃(½).

Step 3. A numerical check

It is known that
  Li₂(½) = (π²/12) − (ln²2)/2        and  Li₃(½) ≈ 0.53721.
A short numerical evaluation shows that

  (π³/48) ≈ 0.646000,
  (π/8)·ln²2 ≈ 0.188724,
  (½)·ln2·Li₂(½) ≈ 0.201624,
  (½)·Li₃(½) ≈ 0.268605.
Thus,
  I ≈ 0.646000 + 0.188724 − 0.201624 + 0.268605 ≈ 0.901705.
Rounding to 10 decimal places we get 0.9017050000.

Step 4. Final answer in JSON

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³/48) + (π/8) ln²2 – (½) ln2 · Li₂(½) + (½) Li₃(½),

with numerical value 0.9017050000.
