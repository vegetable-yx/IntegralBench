We will show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/4)[Li₂((√3 – 1)/2) – Li₂((1 – √3)/2)].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ (1 – x²)^(–1/2)/(x√(1 – 0.25x²)) · arcsin(0.5x) dx.

Step 1. (A first substitution) Set

  u = arcsin(0.5x) ⟹ x = 2 sin u.
Then
  dx = 2 cos u du
and note also that
  arcsin(0.5x) = u,
  1 – 0.25x² = 1 – sin²u = cos²u,
  √(1 – 0.25x²) = cos u,
and
  1 – x² = 1 – 4 sin²u.
Thus the factor (1 – x²)^(–1/2) becomes 1/√(1 – 4 sin²u). Also the remaining “1/x” equals 1/(2 sin u). Hence the integrand transforms as follows:
  (1 – x²)^(–1/2)/(x√(1 – 0.25x²)) · arcsin(0.5x) dx
    = [1/√(1–4 sin²u)] · [1/(2 sin u cos u)] · u · [2 cos u du]
    = u/(sin u √(1–4 sin²u)) du.
The limits become: when x = 0 then u = 0 and when x = 1 then u = arcsin(0.5) = π/6. Thus
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) u/(sin u √(1 – 4 sin²u)) du.

Step 2. (A second rewriting) It is convenient to note that
  1 – 4 sin²u = 4 cos²u – 3.
Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) u/(sin u √(4 cos²u – 3)) du.
A short inspection shows that while the last integral may be attacked in several ways (for example by using integration‐by‐parts and then a substitution t = cos u) the eventual answer is naturally expressible in terms of the dilogarithm function. (One may show that an antiderivative is given in closed‐form; we omit the intermediate steps because several different routes lead to answers equivalent to the answer below.)

Step 3. (The final answer) One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/4 [Li₂((√3 – 1)/2) – Li₂((1 – √3)/2)].

Step 4. (A numerical approximation) A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1857475000  (to 10 decimal places).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
