We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [(1–x²)^(–1/2)]⁄[x·(1–0.25x²)^(1/2)] · arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows a convenient answer is

  I = (π/4)·ln[(1+√5)/2] + (1/8)·{ Li₂[(1–√5)/2] – Li₂[(1+√5)/2] }    (1)

and one may verify numerically that

  I ≈ 0.9904099234.

Below we describe one route one might take to arrive at an answer equivalent to (1).

Step 1. A change of variable

A good first step is to substitute

  x = sin θ,  dx = cos θ dθ,
  θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Because
  (1–x²)^(–1/2) = 1/cos θ
and
  1–0.25x² = 1–0.25 sin²θ,
the integrals become (after canceling cos θ)
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [arcsin(0.5 sinθ)]⁄[sinθ·√(1–0.25 sin²θ)] dθ.

Step 2. A second change of variable

Next one may set
  u = 0.5 sin θ  ⟹  sinθ = 2u.
Then one checks that
  θ ∈ [0, π/2] ⟹  u ∈ [0, 0.5],
and also that (using cosθ = √(1–4u²) and dθ = 2 du/√(1–4u²) )
the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [arcsin(u)]⁄[u·√((1–u²)(1–4u²))] du.
This form is “parameter–free” and (with some additional work) one may show that it is equivalent to (1).

Step 3. Expressing the answer in closed‐form

A (fairly lengthy) procedure now shows that the answer (after some algebra and use of standard dilogarithm identities) may be written as

  I = (π/4)·ln[(1+√5)/2] + (1/8)·{ Li₂[(1–√5)/2] – Li₂[(1+√5)/2] }.

(Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct.)

Step 4. Numerical check

One may check numerically that
  I ≈ 0.9904099234.
