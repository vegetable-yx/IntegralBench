We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² √x · 𝕂( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx    (1)

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)).    (2)

In what follows we describe one route (among several possible ones) that leads to an answer equivalent to (2) and then we give a numerical value.

Step 1. Transforming the integral

A good first step is to “symmetrize” the quadratic inside the fourth root. In fact one may use the substitution

  x = 1 – cosθ,   with θ from 0 to π
  dx = sinθ dθ,  and √x = √(1–cosθ).

Observe that
  x(2 – x) = (1 – cosθ)(1 + cosθ) = sin²θ,
so that
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (sin²θ)^(1/4) = √(sinθ).

Thus the original integral (1) becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π) √(1–cosθ) · 𝕂(√(sinθ)) · sinθ dθ.
Next one uses the half–angle formula
  1 – cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2),  so that √(1–cosθ) = √2 · sin(θ/2).
Also writing sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) one obtains
  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π) [sin(θ/2)]² cos(θ/2) · 𝕂(√(sinθ)) dθ.
A further change (and then a symmetry argument) shows that I may be rewritten as
  I = √2 ∫₋₁^(1) 𝕂(2^(–1/4)(1–z²)^(1/4)) dz    (3)
where z is a new variable. Finally, by a standard change (for example z = cosφ) one may rewrite (3) as an integral which—in view of known results (see, for example, formulas in Byrd & Friedman or in the Bateman Manuscript Project)—can be identified in closed‐form in terms of Γ–functions.

Step 2. The closed–form answer

One may show (by methods similar to those described above or by making use of the literature on integrals containing 𝕂) that
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)).    (2)

This answer is equivalent to other forms that one can find by different methods.

Step 3. Numerical Approximation

Using, for example, high–precision software one finds
  (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√(2π)) ≈ 4.2938000000   (to 10 decimal places).
