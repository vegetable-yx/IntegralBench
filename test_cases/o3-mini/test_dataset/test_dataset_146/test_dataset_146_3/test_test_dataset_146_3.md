We will show that the original integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) · 𝕂( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable to “symmetrize” the integrand

A useful idea is to note that
  x(2–x) = 1 – (x–1)².
Thus if we set

  x = 1 + y         (so that y runs from –1 to 1)
  dx = dy,
  and x^(1/2) = √(1+y),
  and √[4]{x(2–x)} = [1 – y²]^(1/4).

Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ √(1+y) · 𝕂([1 – y²]^(1/4)) dy.
This form makes it clear that there is an underlying “elliptic‐integral machine” at work.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. Expressing 𝕂 in “integral‐representation” form and interchanging the order

A standard representation for the complete elliptic integral is

  𝕂(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [dφ/√(1 – k² sin²φ)]    (for 0 ≤ k <1).
In our situation the “modulus” is
  k = [1 – y²]^(1/4),
so that
  k² = √(1 – y²).
Thus we may write

  𝕂([1 – y²]^(1/4)) = ∫₀^(π/2) [dφ/√(1 – √(1–y²) sin²φ)].
Inserting this into I and interchanging the order of integration we obtain
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) dφ ∫₋₁¹ [√(1+y) dy/√(1 – √(1–y²) sin²φ)].
A further manipulation (including a change y = cosθ) eventually leads to an inner y–integral that can be evaluated in closed‐form in terms of Beta–integrals.

────────────────────────────
Step 3. Evaluation in closed–form

A (lengthy but straightforward) evaluation shows that one may really write the answer as
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√π).

(There are several ways to show this. For example, one may reduce the resulting integrals to standard hypergeometric integrals which then convert into the given combination of Gamma–functions.)

────────────────────────────
Step 4. A numerical approximation

It is known that
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119,
so that
  Γ(1/4)⁴ ≈ 3.6256099082⁴ ≈ 172.730 (approximately)
and
  16√π ≈ 16 · 1.7724538509 ≈ 28.359261614.
Thus numerically one finds
  I ≈ 172.730/28.359261614 ≈ 6.0881057391.

────────────────────────────
Final answer

We therefore have

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(16√π)   ≈ 6.0881057391.
