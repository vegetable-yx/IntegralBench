We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₍₁/√2₎¹ (arcsin(x) / x³) dx.

Step 1. Substitute u = arcsin(x). Then
  x = sin(u)  and  dx = cos(u) du.
Also, when x = 1/√2, then u = arcsin(1/√2) = π/4, and when x = 1, then u = π/2.
Substitute into the integrand:
  arcsin(x) = u  and  x³ = sin³(u).
Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) [ u / sin³(u) ] cos(u) du.

Step 2. Rewrite the integrand:
  I = ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) u · [cos(u) / sin³(u)] du.
Notice that the derivative of 1/sin²(u) is
  d/du [1/sin²(u)] = –2 cos(u)/sin³(u),
so we have
  cos(u)/sin³(u) = –(1/2) d/du [1/sin²(u)].
Thus, the integral becomes
  I = –(1/2) ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) u d[1/sin²(u)].

Step 3. Integrate by parts.
Let
  v = u  ⇒ dv = du,
  and dw = d[1/sin²(u)]  ⇒ w = 1/sin²(u).
Then,
  ∫ u dw = u·w – ∫ w du.
Thus,
  I = –(1/2) [u·(1/sin²(u))|₍π/4₎^(π/2) – ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) 1/sin²(u) du].

Examine the boundary term:
 At u = π/2: sin(π/2) = 1 ⇒ 1/sin²(π/2) = 1.
 At u = π/4: sin(π/4) = √2/2 ⇒ sin²(π/4) = 1/2 ⇒ 1/sin²(π/4) = 2.
Thus,
  u/sin²(u)|₍π/4₎^(π/2) = ( (π/2)·1 ) – ( (π/4)·2 ) = (π/2) – (π/2) = 0.

So the integral reduces to
  I = –(1/2)[0 – ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) 1/sin²(u) du] = (1/2) ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) csc²(u) du.

Step 4. Integrate csc²(u).
We know that ∫ csc²(u) du = –cot(u), so
  ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) csc²(u) du = [–cot(u)]₍π/4₎^(π/2)
    = [–cot(π/2) + cot(π/4)].
Since cot(π/2) = 0 and cot(π/4) = 1, we obtain
  ∫₍π/4₎^(π/2) csc²(u) du = 1.

Thus,
  I = (1/2) · 1 = 1/2.

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
The exact result is 1/2, which numerically is 0.5. To 10 decimal places, this is 0.5000000000.
