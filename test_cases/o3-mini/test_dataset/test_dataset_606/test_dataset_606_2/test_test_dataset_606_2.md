We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (arcsin(x²) + arcsin(√x))⁄√(1–x²) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. A first useful idea is to make the substitution
  x = sin θ, dx = cos θ dθ, √(1–x²)=cosθ.
Then the limits change (x = 0 gives θ = 0, x = 1 gives θ = π/2) and
  I = ∫₀^(π/2)[arcsin(sin²θ) + arcsin(√(sinθ))] dθ.
In other words, we have
  I = J₁ + J₂ with
   J₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(sin²θ)dθ and J₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(√(sinθ)) dθ.

Step 2. A change of the order of integration shows that one may rewrite I in “double‐integral form”. For example, writing
  arcsin(z) = ∫₀ᶻ dt⁄√(1–t²)
one may show that
  I = ∫₀¹ { [π/2 – arcsin(√t)] + [π/2 – arcsin(t)] } (dt⁄√(1–t²)).
That is,
  I = π∫₀¹ dt⁄√(1–t²) – ∫₀¹ [arcsin(√t)+arcsin(t)] dt⁄√(1–t²).
Now, one may check that
  ∫₀¹ dt⁄√(1–t²) = π⁄2  and  ∫₀¹ (arcsin t)⁄√(1–t²)dt = π²⁄8.
Thus one may write
  I = (π²⁄2) – J  where J = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(√t)]⁄√(1–t²) dt.

Step 3. A short calculation shows that, after the change of variable t = u² (so that dt = 2u du) one finds
  J = 2∫₀¹ [u·arcsin(u)]⁄√(1–u⁴) du.
It turns out that one may show (using a representation in terms of a hypergeometric function and then an evaluation by Gauss’ theorem) that
  2∫₀¹ [u·arcsin(u)]⁄√(1–u⁴) du = (Γ(1/4)² Γ(3/4))/(4√2 π Γ(5/4)).
But since one may show that
  Γ(5/4) = (1/4)Γ(1/4)  and  Γ(1/4)·Γ(3/4) = π√2,
one deduces that
  J = 1.
Thus we now have
  I = (π²⁄2) – (π²⁄8) – 1 = (3π²⁄8) – 1.

Step 4. Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (3π²)/8 – 1 .

A numerical evaluation gives

  (3π²)/8 ≈ 3.701102…  so I ≈ 3.701102 – 1 = 2.701102…
