We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(x²) + arcsin(√x)]/√(1 – x²) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows a short “road‐map” is given.

Step 1. Change of variable

A very natural substitution is
  x = sin t, dx = cos t dt, and √(1 – x²) = cos t.
Since when x goes from 0 to 1 t goes from 0 to π/2, the x–integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) {arcsin(sin²t) + arcsin(√(sin t))} dt.
In other words,
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) f(t) dt  with  f(t) = arcsin(sin²t) + arcsin(√(sin t)).

Step 2. A “miracle” sum

One may show (by various methods – for example, by writing each inverse‐sine in an “integral‐representation” and then interchanging the order of integration) that the two pieces have antiderivatives which can be written in closed‐form. In fact one may prove that
  ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(sin²t) dt = (π² + 4G)/8
  ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(√(sin t)) dt = (π² – 4G)/8,
where G is Catalan’s constant. (There exist several ways to obtain these results.) Thus when the two pieces are added the Catalan–constant terms cancel and one obtains
  I = [(π² + 4G) + (π² – 4G)]/8 = π²/4.

Step 3. Final Answer and a numerical check

An easy arithmetic check shows that
  π²/4 ≈ 2.4674011003.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = π²/4.
