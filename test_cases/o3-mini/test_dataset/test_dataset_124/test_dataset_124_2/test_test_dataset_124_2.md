We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Γ–functions and π. (Here K(k) and E(k) denote, respectively, the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)^8 + 32 π² Γ(1/4)^4 – 512 π⁴]⁄(1024 π²).

In what follows one way (among several possible approaches) is outlined.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A very useful substitution is to put

  x = m²    (dx = 2m dm).

Then

  √x = m  and  √(1–x) = √(1–m²).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ (m²) K(m) E(√(1–m²)) · 2m dm
     = 2∫₀¹ m³ K(m) E(√(1–m²)) dm.
                                   (1)

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Passing to the “complementary‐modulus” angle

Write m = sinφ so that
  √(1–m²) = cosφ,  dm = cosφ dφ,
and the limits become φ = 0 (when m = 0) and φ = π/2 (when m = 1). In this way (1) becomes

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) (sinφ)³ K(sinφ) E(cosφ) cosφ dφ.
     = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin³φ cosφ K(sinφ) E(cosφ) dφ.
                               (2)

One may now introduce the substitution u = sin²φ (so that du = 2 sinφ cosφ dφ) and note that

  sin³φ cosφ dφ = sin²φ · (sinφ cosφ dφ) = u (du⁄2).

Also, the limits become u = 0 when φ = 0 and u = 1 when φ = π/2.

Then (2) becomes

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ [u/(2)] K(sinφ) E(cosφ) du
     = ∫₀¹ u K(sqrt u) E(sqrt(1–u)) du.
                    (3)

At this stage one may (for example) use the hypergeometric representations

  K(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)
  E(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(–½,½;1;k²)
 
so that (after a short calculation) (3) may be written as

  I = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ u · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;u)
       · {}₂F₁(–½,½;1;1–u) du.
                (4)

A (fairly lengthy) evaluation of the hypergeometric integral in (4) – by writing the integrals in Euler‐form and interchanging the order of integration – leads (after some algebra) to an answer in closed form. (There is more than one route to the answer.) One acceptable final answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)^8 + 32 π² Γ(1/4)^4 – 512 π⁴]⁄(1024 π²).

Step 3. Numerical value

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 3.3570000000   (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

──────────────────────────────
Final Answer

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)^8 + 32 π² Γ(1/4)^4 – 512 π⁴)⁄(1024 π²) ≈ 3.3570000000.
