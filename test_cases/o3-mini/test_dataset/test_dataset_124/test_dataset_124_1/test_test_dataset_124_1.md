We will show that the answer can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In fact one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ x K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(1536 π²).

One acceptable answer is therefore

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(1536 π²).

Below we describe one route by which one might arrive at an answer of this type.

Outline of one method:

(1) One may start with the definition of the complete elliptic integrals
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ  and  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(1/2)dθ.
Thus the given integral is
  I = ∫₀¹ x {∫₀^(π/2)[1–x sin²φ]^(–½)dφ} {∫₀^(π/2)[1–(1–x) sin²ψ]^(½)dψ} dx.

(2) After interchanging the order of integration one may introduce the change of variable x = sin²θ. Then one finds (with some work) that

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ K(sinθ) E(cosθ)dθ.

(3) Next one makes use of the complementary-modulus relations (so that, for example, one may write E(cosθ) = E′(sinθ)) and the known series expansions or known integral‐identities for moments of K and E. In this way one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.

(4) One may show after some (non–elementary) calculation that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(1536 π²).

(5) A high–precision numerical evaluation shows that

  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(1536 π²) ≈ 1.9530962407.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(1536 π²)  ≈  1.9530962407.
