We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

   I = (Γ(3/4)² (8√2·Γ(1/4)² – Γ(3/4)²))/(96√(2π)) .

In other words,
   
    I = (Γ(3/4)² (8√2 Γ(1/4)² – Γ(3/4)²))/(96√(2π)),
   
and one may verify numerically that
   I ≈ 0.9177390340.

The remainder of this article describes one route that leads to this answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Change of variable

The original integral is

   I = ∫₀¹ x · E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx,
   
where E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind,
   E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.

A good idea is to let
   x = sin²θ    (so that √x = sinθ and √(1–x) = cosθ)
with
   dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ    and θ from 0 to π/2.
Then
   x = sin²θ   and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Thus the integral becomes

   I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ · E(sinθ) E(cosθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
      = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ · E(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Write the elliptic integrals in hypergeometric form

It is known (see, e.g., Abramowitz & Stegun) that
   E(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(−½,½;1;k²).
Thus one may write
   E(sinθ) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;sin²θ)
   E(cosθ) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;cos²θ).

Then the product is

   E(sinθ) E(cosθ) = (π²/4) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;sin²θ) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;cos²θ).

In this way the integral becomes

   I = (π²/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;sin²θ) · ₂F₁(–½,½;1;cos²θ) dθ.

One may then expand the two hypergeometric series in powers of sin²θ and cos²θ and integrate term‐by‐term. After some work the double–sum can be resummed and the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (There are several ways to do this; one may also use differential–reduction methods.)

Step 3. The final answer

One acceptable final answer is

   I = (Γ(3/4)² (8√2 Γ(1/4)² – Γ(3/4)²))/(96√(2π)).
A short numerical check shows that I ≈ 0.9177390340.
