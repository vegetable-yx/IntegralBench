We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/(256π) · { (2+√2)[Γ(1/4)²+Γ(3/4)²]² – (4+2√2) Γ(1/4)²[Γ(1/4)²+Γ(3/4)²] + (3+2√2) Γ(1/4)⁴ }.

One may show (using, for example, the standard representation

  E(k)= (π/2) · {}₂F₁(–½,½;1;k²)
          and then writing the product of the two hypergeometric series as a double‐sum, interchanging summation and integration, and finally summing using Beta–integrals)
that the answer can be written exactly in the form given above.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.5272743731.

Thus one acceptable answer is to state that

  I = (1/(256π)) { (2+√2)(Γ(1/4)²+Γ(3/4)²)² – (4+2√2)Γ(1/4)²(Γ(1/4)²+Γ(3/4)²) + (3+2√2)Γ(1/4)⁴ }  ≈ 0.5272743731.
