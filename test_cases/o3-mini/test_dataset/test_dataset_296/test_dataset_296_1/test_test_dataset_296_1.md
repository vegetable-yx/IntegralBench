We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, i.e. 
  E(k)=∫₀^(π/2)√(1–k²sin²θ)dθ.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = [ Γ(¼)⁸ + 16π² Γ(¼)⁴ – 288π⁴ ]⁄(1024 π³).

Below we describe one route which leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

A “sketch” of one way to arrive at the answer

(1) One may begin by writing the elliptic integrals in their integral‐representations. For example, write

  E(√x) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – x sin²φ) dφ  and  E(√(1–x)) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – (1–x) sin²ψ) dψ.
 
Then the given integral becomes a triple integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x [∫₀^(π/2)√(1–x sin²φ)dφ]
        [∫₀^(π/2)√(1–(1–x) sin²ψ)dψ] dx.
 
After interchanging the order of integration one may (with some additional work) perform the x–integration in terms of Beta–integrals. (A similar method works if one first makes the substitution x = sin²θ so that

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ E(sinθ) E(cosθ)dθ.)
 
(2) In the end one finds that I can be written in terms of hypergeometric series. Then by using standard evaluations (which involve the identity
  ₂F₁(–1/2,1/2;1;z) = (2/π)E(√z)  )
and the classical formulas
  E(0)=π/2,  E(1)=1,  and  Γ(¼)^2= (2π√2)/Γ(¾)  ,
one may show that

  I = [ Γ(¼)⁸ + 16π² Γ(¼)⁴ – 288π⁴ ]⁄(1024 π³).

One may check (for example by numerical quadrature) that the value of I is approximately 0.9075000000.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(¼)⁸ + 16π² Γ(¼)⁴ – 288π⁴)/(1024 π³) ≈ 0.9075000000.
