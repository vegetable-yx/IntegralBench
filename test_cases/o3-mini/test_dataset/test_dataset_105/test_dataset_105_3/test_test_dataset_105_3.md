We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀² x · arcsin(0.5√(x(2 – x))) dx.

Step 1. (A change of variable to “center” the integrand)

Let
  u = x – 1  so that  x = u + 1  and  dx = du.
When x = 0, u = –1 and when x = 2, u = 1. Also observe that

  x(2 – x) = (u + 1)(2 – (u + 1)) = (u + 1)(1 – u) = 1 – u².
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ (1 + u) · arcsin(0.5√(1 – u²)) du.

We now split the integrand into two parts:
  I = ∫₋₁¹ arcsin(0.5√(1 – u²)) du + ∫₋₁¹ u·arcsin(0.5√(1 – u²)) du.
Notice that the second integrand is odd (since u is odd and the other factor is even) and the integration is over [–1, 1]. Hence its contribution vanishes and we are left with

  I = ∫₋₁¹ arcsin(0.5√(1 – u²)) du.

Since the integrand is even we can write

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5√(1 – u²)) du.

Step 2. (A trigonometric substitution)

Make the substitution
  u = cosθ,  so that  du = –sinθ dθ.
When u goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from π/2 to 0; reversing the limits we have

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(0.5 sinθ) (sinθ dθ).

Thus, we now need to evaluate
  J = ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ · arcsin(0.5 sinθ) dθ,
so that I = 2J.

Step 3. (Integration by parts)

Let
  U = arcsin(0.5 sinθ)  so that  dU = [0.5 cosθ] / √(1 – 0.25 sin²θ) dθ,
and let
  dV = sinθ dθ  so that  V = –cosθ.
Then, by integration by parts,
  J = [U·V]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) V dU.

Evaluate the boundary term:
  At θ = π/2: sinθ = 1 so U = arcsin(0.5) = π/6 and cos(π/2) = 0, so U·V = 0.
  At θ = 0: sinθ = 0 so U = 0 and cos(0) = 1, so U·V = 0.
Thus
  J = 0 + ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · [0.5 cosθ/√(1 – 0.25 sin²θ)] dθ
    = 0.5 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ / √(1 – 0.25 sin²θ) dθ.
Therefore,
  I = 2J = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ / √(1 – 0.25 sin²θ) dθ.

Step 4. (Changing variable again)

Make the substitution
  u = sinθ  so that  du = cosθ dθ.
Then cos²θ dθ = cosθ (cosθ dθ) = cosθ du and since cosθ = √(1 – u²) (for θ in [0, π/2]) we obtain
  I = ∫₀¹ √(1 – u²) / √(1 – 0.25 u²) du
    = ∫₀¹ √((1 – u²)/(1 – u²/4)) du.
It is convenient to write this as
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ √((1 – u²)/(4 – u²)) du.

Step 5. (Recognizing a standard form)

It turns out that the integral
  L = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/√(1 – m sin²θ)dθ
has a known closed‐form in terms of the complete elliptic integrals K(m) and E(m). In fact, one may show that

  ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/√(1 – m sin²θ) dθ = [E(m) – (1–m) K(m)]/m.
In our case m = 1/4. Hence, our I (which we already had in the form of this integral) is given by
  I = [E(1/4) – (1–1/4)K(1/4)]/(1/4)
    = 4 [E(1/4) – (3/4) K(1/4)]
    = 4E(1/4) – 3K(1/4).

This is an acceptable exact answer.

Step 6. (Numerical Approximation)

Standard numerical approximations for the complete elliptic integrals with parameter m = 1/4 are:
  K(1/4) ≈ 1.6857503548126  and  E(1/4) ≈ 1.4674622093394.
Thus,
  I ≈ 4×1.4674622093394 – 3×1.6857503548126
    ≈ 5.8698488373576 – 5.0572510644378
    ≈ 0.8125977729198.

Rounding to 10 decimal places, we have I ≈ 0.8125977729.
