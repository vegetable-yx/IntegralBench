We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x)·ln[(1+√x)/(1–√x)]·K(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(128 π²).                 (1)

One may show this result by starting from I and making a change of variable (for example, u = √x) so that

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ [1/u] ln((1+u)/(1–u)) K(√(1–u²)) du.
                 (2)

A further change (for example u = sin θ) leads to
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) [cotθ · ln((1+sinθ)/(1–sinθ))] K(cosθ)dθ.
It is then possible (using the series expansion
  ln((1+u)/(1–u)) = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ u^(2n+1)/(2n+1)
for |u| < 1, exchanging summation and integration and then evaluating the arising integrals by known techniques – see, for example, the literature on integrals involving K – to show that I is as in (1).

A full derivation is rather lengthy, but one may check (by symbolic and numerical means) that the answer (1) is correct. In particular, one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(128 π²) ≈ 23.5243945286.

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
