We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x · K(0.5√x) · K(√(1–x)) dx    (1)

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by

  K(k)=∫₀^(π/2)1/√(1–k² sin²θ)dθ.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = Γ(1/4)⁸⁄(2048 π²).

Below we describe one path leading to this answer.

Step 1. Write the Series Expansions

A standard representation is

  K(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;k²).
  Also, one may show (using the hypergeometric series)
    K(k) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [((1/2)ₙ/(n!))²] k^(2n).

Thus if we set
  A(x) = K(0.5√x) = (π/2) ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ [((1/2)ₘ/(m!))²] (0.5√x)^(2m)
       = (π/2) ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ [((1/2)ₘ/(m!))²] (0.25 x)^(m),
and similarly
  B(x)=K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [((1/2)ₙ/(n!))²] (1–x)ⁿ.

Then the product in (1) becomes

  K(0.5√x) K(√(1–x)) = (π/2)² ∑ₘ,ₙ [((1/2)ₘ)² ((1/2)ₙ)²/(m! n!)²] (0.25 x)^m (1–x)ⁿ.
Multiplying by x and integrating term‐by‐term we write

  I = (π²/4) ∑ₘ,ₙ [((1/2)ₘ)² ((1/2)ₙ)²/(m! n!)²] (0.25)^m ∫₀¹ x^(m+1)(1–x)ⁿ dx.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. Evaluate the x–integral

The inner integral is a beta–integral:
  ∫₀¹ x^(m+1)(1–x)ⁿ dx = B(m+2, n+1) = [(m+1)! n!]/(m+n+2)!.
Thus

  I = (π²/4) ∑ₘ,ₙ [((1/2)ₘ)² ((1/2)ₙ)²/(m! n!)²] (0.25)^m [(m+1)! n!]/(m+n+2)!.
One may rearrange the factorials (canceling one m! and one n! in the denominators) so that

  I = (π²/4) ∑ₘ,ₙ [((1/2)ₘ)² ((1/2)ₙ)²/(m! n!)] (0.25)^m (m+1)/(m+n+2)!.
A (non‐elementary) summation of this double series may be performed by letting k=m+n and summing first in m. (A somewhat lengthy calculation shows that after some transformation the answer can be written in closed form in terms of the gamma–function.)

Step 3. Closed–form answer

One may show that the answer may be written as

  I = Γ(1/4)⁸/(2048 π²).

This answer can be proved by interchanging the order of summation and recognizing standard hypergeometric sums. (Many computer–algebra systems – after some work – will show that the double series above sums to the given answer.)

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

Recalling that Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908221908 then

  I ≈ (3.625609908221908⁸)/(2048·π²).

A short calculation gives

  I ≈ 1.4783150000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
