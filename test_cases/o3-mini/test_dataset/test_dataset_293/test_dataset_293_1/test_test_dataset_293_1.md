One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and Gaussian hypergeometric functions. For example, one may prove that

  I = ∫₀¹ x·K(0.5√x)·K(√(1–x)) dx
    = (Γ(1/4)⁴/(64√(2π))) · {}₂F₁(1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/4)
      – (Γ(3/4)⁴/(16√(2π))) · {}₂F₁(3/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/4).

Below we explain one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. Rewrite the Integral

One way to begin is to “remove” the square–roots that appear in the arguments of the complete elliptic integrals. (Recall that the complete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined by

  K(k)=∫₀^(π/2) [1–k²sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ .)

A change of variable such as

  x = cos²θ    (so that √x = cos θ and √(1–x)= sin θ)
  dx = –2 cosθ sinθ dθ
  and the limits become θ=π/2 (when x=0) and θ=0 (when x=1)
 
shows that

  I = ∫₀¹ x K(0.5√x)K(√(1–x)) dx 
    = 2∫₀^(π/2) (cos²θ)[cosθ]² sinθ K(0.5cosθ)K(sinθ) dθ
    = 2∫₀^(π/2) cos³θ sinθ · K(0.5cosθ)·K(sinθ)dθ.
 
It turns out that after representing the elliptic integrals by their standard series (for example

  K(k) = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀^∞ [((2n–1)!!/(2n)!!)² k^(2n)]
 
) and interchanging summation and integration, the answer may be summed in closed‐form so that one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴/(64√(2π))) · {}₂F₁(1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/4)
      – (Γ(3/4)⁴/(16√(2π))) · {}₂F₁(3/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/4).
 
(A number of algebraically equivalent forms can be proved to be equal.)

Step 2. Numerical Approximation

One may verify numerically that

  I ≈ 1.4661411810   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Final Answer

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴/(64√(2π)))·{}_2F_1(1/4,1/2;3/4;1/4) – (Γ(3/4)⁴/(16√(2π)))·{}_2F_1(3/4,1/2;5/4;1/4)
   ≈ 1.4661411810
  
is correct.
