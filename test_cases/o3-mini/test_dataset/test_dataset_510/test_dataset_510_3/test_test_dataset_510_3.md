To solve the integral

  I = ∫₀^(5π/2) [dx/(2 + cos x)],

we first notice that the integrand is periodic with period 2π. Therefore, we can split the integral as follows:

  I = ∫₀^(2π) [dx/(2 + cos x)] + ∫_(2π)^(5π/2) [dx/(2 + cos x)].

Since the function is 2π-periodic, the second term is the same as

  ∫₀^(π/2) [dx/(2 + cos x)].

Step 1. Evaluate ∫₀^(2π) [dx/(2 + cos x)]:

A standard result for integrals of the form

  ∫₀^(2π) [dx/(a + b cos x)] = (2π/√(a² − b²)),  (where |a|>|b|),

applies here with a = 2 and b = 1. Thus,

  ∫₀^(2π) [dx/(2 + cos x)] = 2π/√(4 − 1) = 2π/√3.

Step 2. Evaluate ∫₀^(π/2) [dx/(2 + cos x)]:

Make the substitution u = tan(x/2); then
  dx = 2 du/(1 + u²)
and the cosine transforms as
  cos x = (1 − u²)/(1 + u²).

Thus, the denominator becomes

  2 + cos x = 2 + (1 − u²)/(1 + u²) = [2(1 + u²) + 1 − u²]⁄(1 + u²) = (3 + u²)/(1 + u²).

The integral transforms to

  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) [dx/(2 + cos x)]
    = ∫_(u=0)^(tan(π/4)=1) [2 du/(1 + u²)]⁄[(3 + u²)/(1 + u²)]
    = 2∫₀^1 du/(3 + u²).

Now, note that

  ∫ du/(3 + u²) = (1/√3) arctan(u/√3).

Therefore,

  I₂ = 2/√3 [arctan(1/√3) − arctan(0)].
Since arctan(1/√3) = π/6,
  I₂ = 2/√3 (π/6) = π/(3√3).

Step 3. Combine the results:

  I = (2π/√3) + (π/(3√3)) = (6π/(3√3)) + (π/(3√3)) = 7π/(3√3).

Thus, the exact answer is
  I = 7π/(3√3).

Step 4. Numerical approximation:

Using π ≈ 3.141592653589793 and √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772,
  numerical value = (7×3.141592653589793)/(3×1.7320508075688772) ≈ 21.991148575128552/5.196152422706632 ≈ 4.2334245730.
