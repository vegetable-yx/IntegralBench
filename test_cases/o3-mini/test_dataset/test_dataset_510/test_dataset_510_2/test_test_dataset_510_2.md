We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(5π/2) 1/(2 + cos x) dx.

Step 1. Use Periodicity

Since cos x is periodic with period 2π, we split the integral as follows:
  I = ∫₀^(2π) 1/(2+cos x) dx + ∫_(2π)^(5π/2) 1/(2+cos x) dx.
By periodicity, if we shift the second interval,
  ∫_(2π)^(5π/2) 1/(2+cos x) dx = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(2+cos x) dx.
Thus, we have
  I = I₁ + I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₀^(2π) 1/(2+cos x) dx  and  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(2+cos x) dx.

Step 2. Evaluate I₁

A standard formula for integrals of the form
  ∫₀^(2π) dx/(a + b cos x),
when a > |b|, is
  ∫₀^(2π) dx/(a+b cos x) = 2π/√(a² – b²).
Here, a = 2 and b = 1 so that a² – b² = 4–1 = 3. Hence,
  I₁ = 2π/√3.

Step 3. Evaluate I₂

For the integral
  I₂ = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(2+cos x) dx,
we use the known antiderivative for
  ∫ dx/(a+cos x) = (2/√(a²–1))·arctan(√((a–1)/(a+1))·tan(x/2)) + C,
with a = 2. Note that √(2²–1) = √3 and
  √((2–1)/(2+1)) = √(1/3) = 1/√3.
Thus, the antiderivative becomes
  F(x) = (2/√3)·arctan((1/√3)·tan(x/2)) + C.
Evaluating from x = 0 to x = π/2:

• At x = π/2: tan(π/4) = 1 so that
  F(π/2) = (2/√3)·arctan(1/√3) = (2/√3)·(π/6) = π/(3√3).
• At x = 0: tan(0) = 0 and thus F(0) = 0.

It follows that
  I₂ = π/(3√3).

Step 4. Combine the Results

Thus, the full integral is
  I = I₁ + I₂ = (2π/√3) + (π/(3√3)) = (6π + π)/(3√3) = (7π)/(3√3).

Step 5. Provide a Numerical Approximation

Now, approximate the value:
  √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772 ⇒ 3√3 ≈ 5.196152422706632,
  7π ≈ 21.991148575128552.
Thus,
  I ≈ 21.991148575128552 / 5.196152422706632 ≈ 4.2321601690.
