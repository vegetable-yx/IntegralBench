We wish to calculate

  I = ∫₁∞ (log x)/(x²) dx.

Step 1. Integration by parts

Let
  u = log x  ⇒  du = (1/x) dx,
  dv = 1/x² dx  ⇒  v = ∫1/x² dx = -1/x.

Then using the formula

  ∫ u dv = [uv]₁∞ - ∫₁∞ v du,

we have

  I = [(-log x)/x]₁∞ - ∫₁∞ [ -1/x ⋅ 1/x dx ] 
    = [(-log x)/x]₁∞ + ∫₁∞ 1/x² dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the boundary term

For the term [(-log x)/x] evaluated at x → ∞:
  limₓ→∞ (-log x)/x = 0    (since log x grows slower than x)

At x = 1:
  log 1 = 0  ⇒  (-log1)/1 = 0.

Thus, the boundary term is 0 - 0 = 0.

Step 3. Evaluate the remaining integral

Now, we calculate
  ∫₁∞ 1/x² dx.

The antiderivative is
  ∫ 1/x² dx = -1/x + C.

Evaluating from 1 to ∞:
  [ -1/∞ ] - [ -1/1 ] = 0 + 1 = 1.

Thus, I = 0 + 1 = 1.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

The exact result is 1, which numerically approximates to 1.0000000000.
