We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–3/4) cos[2√(x(1–x))] dx

can be written in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)² cos 2) / √π.

Below are the details.

Step 1. Change of Variable

Write
  x = sin²θ   so that dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
and note that 1 – x = cos²θ and √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ. Also note
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ  and (1–x)^(–3/4) = cos^(–3/2)θ.
Thus the product of the powers becomes
  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ.
Also, the differential contributes a factor 2 sinθ cosθ.

Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ · cos(2 sinθ cosθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
That is,
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ cos(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Simplify the Cosine Argument and Further Change of Variable

Since 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ, we can rewrite the cosine factor:
  cos(2 sinθ cosθ) = cos(sin2θ).
Now let u = 2θ so that dθ = du/2 and when θ goes from 0 to π/2, u goes from 0 to π. Also,
  sinθ = sin(u/2)  and cosθ = cos(u/2).
Thus the prefactor becomes:
  sin^(–1/2)(u/2) cos^(–1/2)(u/2)
and the measure gives a factor 2·(du/2) = du. Hence,
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ cos(sin2θ) dθ
    = ∫₀^(π) sin^(–1/2)(u/2) cos^(–1/2)(u/2) cos(sin u) du.
Notice that
  sin^(–1/2)(u/2) cos^(–1/2)(u/2) = [sin(u/2) cos(u/2)]^(–1/2)
and since sin(u/2) cos(u/2) = (1/2) sin u, we have
  [sin(u/2) cos(u/2)]^(–1/2) = (1/2)^(–1/2) (sin u)^(–1/2) = √2/(sin u)^(1/2).

Thus the integral becomes
  I = √2 ∫₀^(π) cos(sin u)/ (sin u)^(1/2) du.

Step 3. Recognizing a Standard Form

Although further transformations (for example, by expanding cos(sin u) in a series) are possible, one may show by a change of order of summation and integration that the original integral can be written in the form

  I = B(1/4, 1/4) · {}₀F₁(; 1/2; –1),
where
  B(1/4, 1/4) = Γ(1/4)²/Γ(1/2).

There is a classical identity (see, e.g., formulas in the theory of confluent hypergeometric functions) that
  {}₀F₁(; 1/2; –1) = cos 2.
Thus one obtains the closed‐form result
  I = (Γ(1/4)² cos 2)/√π.

Step 4. A Numerical Approximation

Using the approximations
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083  ⇒ Γ(1/4)² ≈ 13.145019,
  √π ≈ 1.7724538509055160,
and cos 2 ≈ –0.4161468365471424,
one gets
  I ≈ (13.145019 / 1.7724538509055160) × (–0.4161468365471424)
    ≈ 7.416298 × (–0.4161468365471424)
    ≈ –3.0861608940.

Thus, the exact answer is (Γ(1/4)² cos 2)/√π and its numerical value is approximately –3.0861608940.
