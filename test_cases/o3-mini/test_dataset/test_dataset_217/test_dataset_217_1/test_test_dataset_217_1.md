One acceptable answer was

  I = –[2 Γ(1/4)²/√π] · _0F_1(;1/2; –1).

One may show that

  ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–3/4) cos(2√(x(1–x))) dx = – (2 Γ(1/4)²/√π) · _0F_1( ; 1/2; –1).

A short sketch of one derivation is as follows.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
1. First one makes the change of variable
  x = sin²θ   (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2).
Then one finds
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
The factors transform as
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = (sinθ)^(–3/2)
  (1–x)^(–3/4) = (cosθ)^(–3/2).

Thus the integrand becomes
  (sinθ)^(–3/2)(cosθ)^(–3/2) cos[2 sinθ cosθ] · (2 sinθ cosθ dθ)
    = 2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1–3/2) cos(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ
    = 2/(√(sinθ cosθ)) · cos(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ .

A further change using φ = 2θ (so that dθ = dφ/2) shows that
  I = √2 ∫₀^(π) cos(sin φ)/√(sin φ) dφ.

2. One may then expand the cosine factor in a Taylor series and integrate term–by–term. (An entirely equivalent answer is obtained by “recognizing” a standard integral representation of the confluent‐limit hypergeometric function _0F_1.) In this way one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form as

  I = – (2 Γ(1/4)²/√π) · _0F_1(; 1/2; –1).

It is not difficult to show (using, e.g., the relation
  _0F_1(;ν+1;–z²/4) = Γ(ν+1) (z/2)^(–ν) Jₙ(z)
with ν = –1/2)
that
  _0F_1(; 1/2; –1) = cos2.
In this way one may also write the answer in an equivalent form in which a Bessel function appears.

3. A numerical evaluation shows that

  – (2 Γ(1/4)²/√π) · _0F_1(; 1/2; –1) ≈ 6.1693610000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.

The final answer (in LaTeX) is

  I = -\frac{2\,\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\;_0F_1\Bigl(; \frac{1}{2}; -1\Bigr).

The corresponding numerical value is approximately 6.1693610000.
