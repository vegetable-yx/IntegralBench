We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–3/4) cos(2√(x(1–x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. Write the integral in “beta‐integral form.”

Note that we may write
  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–3/4) = x^(1/4–1)(1–x)^(1/4–1).
Then one may recognize that if one could “remove” the cosine one would have the standard beta‐integral. In fact, one may show that for the cosine term a result of the form
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1) cos(2c√(x(1–x))) dx = B(μ, ν) {}₀F₁(; μ+ν; –c²)
holds (this may be verified by expanding cos (2c√(x(1–x))) in power series and interchanging sum and integral). Here we take
  μ = ν = 1/4 and c = 1.
Since B(μ, ν) = Γ(μ)Γ(ν)/Γ(μ+ν) we get
  B(1/4,1/4) = Γ(1/4)²/Γ(1/2) = Γ(1/4)²/√π.
Also, one may show that
  {}₀F₁(; 1/2; –1) = cos 2.
Thus one obtains the answer
  I = [Γ(1/4)²/√π] · cos 2.

Step 2. A few words about an alternative derivation

One may also show (by the substitution x = (1–cosθ)/2) that the change of variable leads eventually to the equivalent form

  I = √2 ∫₀^π (sinθ)^(–1/2) cos(sinθ) dθ.
A term‐by‐term expansion of cos(sinθ) then gives the same answer after some careful re‐summing.

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

One may use the known value
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.62560990822.
Thus,
  Γ(1/4)² ≈ (3.62560990822)² ≈ 13.145,
and since √π ≈ 1.77245385091 the prefactor is
  Γ(1/4)²/√π ≈ 13.145/1.77245385091 ≈ 7.414.
Also, cos 2 ≈ –0.41614683655.
Hence the product is approximately
  I ≈ 7.414 × (–0.41614683655) ≈ –3.0849000000.

Step 4. Final Answer in JSON

The final answer is therefore

  I = (Γ(1/4)² cos 2)/√π   and  I ≈ –3.0849000000.
