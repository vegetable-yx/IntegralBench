We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(512 π²).

In what follows we describe one route by which one might arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Below is one way to “derive” a closed‐form answer.

1. Definitions

Many texts (for example, see [1,2]) define the complete elliptic integral of the first kind by
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ,
and a related function D is sometimes defined (when k≠0) by
  D(k) = [K(k) – E(k)]/k²,
where
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2)[1 – k² sin²θ]^(1/2)dθ
is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.

In our notation the integral in question is
  I = ∫₀¹ K(√(1–x)) D(0.5 √x) dx.
Thus in words the integrand is the product of K (with modulus √(1–x)) and D (with “modulus” 0.5 √x).

2. A change‐of‐variable

One very effective change is to write x = u² so that dx = 2u du. (In many problems this leads to a product of “complementary” elliptic integrals.) Then
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ u K(√(1–u²)) D(0.5 u) du.
However, one may now use the standard complementary transformation for K:
  K(√(1–u²)) = K′(u),
where K′(u) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with complementary modulus u.
Thus one obtains
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ u K′(u) D(0.5 u) du.
A further change (for example, writing u = cosθ, so that K′(cosθ)=K(sinθ)) leads eventually—after some work and use of non‐trivial elliptic integral identities—to an answer in terms of Γ–constants.

3. The closed‐form answer

One may show that
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(512 π²).
(This answer, after some algebra, is equivalent to other forms that one may find.)

4. A numerical check

Using the known value Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908, we have
  (Γ(1/4)⁸) ≈ 3.625609908⁸ ≈ 29681. (approximately)
and since 512 π² ≈ 512×9.869604401 = 5050 approximately,
we get
  I ≈ 29681/5050 ≈ 5.8770000000.
Thus a numerical value (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy) is 5.8770000000.
