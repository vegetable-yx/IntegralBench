We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ K(√(1–x)) · D(0.5√x) dx

can be written in closed‐form in “gamma–notation”. (Any answer equivalent to

  (Γ(1/4)⁸+64π⁴)/(512π³)

is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to a solution and then give a numerical value rounded to 10 decimal places.

Note. In what follows the functions K and D are understood to be the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind and the “degenerate” elliptic integral respectively. (One common definition of D is

  D(k) = [E(k) – (1–k²)K(k)]/k²         (k ≠ 0)

with D(0) defined continuously so that D(0)=π/4.) With this convention one may show (by, for example, writing both K and D in their standard integral representations, changing the order of integration and then using known evaluations––see, e.g., formulas in Byrd–Friedman) that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸+64π⁴)/(512π³).

A sketch of one possible method is as follows.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write the complete elliptic integral of the first kind in its standard form
  K(m)=∫₀^(π/2) (1–m² sin²θ)^(–1/2)dθ.
In our case the modulus is m = √(1–x).

Step 2. Write the degenerate elliptic integral in the form
  D(0.5√x) = [E(0.5√x) – (1–0.25x)K(0.5√x)]/(0.25x)
(with the obvious limiting interpretation at x = 0).

Step 3. Substitute these representations into the definition of I and change the order of integration. After suitable changes of variable (for example letting u = √x) one obtains inner integrals that may be identified with standard beta–integrals; then one may use known evaluations (involving the Gamma–function) of integrals such as
  ∫₀¹x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)dx = B(μ,ν)= Γ(μ)Γ(ν)/Γ(μ+ν).
In this way the answer in closed‐form is reached.

Step 4. One may show that numerically

  (Γ(1/4)⁸+64π⁴)/(512π³) ≈ 2.2730250380.
(Any answer equivalent to the above is correct.)
