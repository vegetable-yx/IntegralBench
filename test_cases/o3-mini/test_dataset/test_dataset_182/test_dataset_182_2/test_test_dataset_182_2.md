We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1) √(4 – x²) · arctan(x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Below is one possible solution.

Step 1. (A Change of Variable)

A very natural substitution is

  x = 2 sin θ     ⇒ dx = 2 cos θ dθ,  and √(4 – x²) = 2 cos θ.
When x runs from 0 to 2, θ runs from 0 to π/2. Also,
  x^(–1) = 1/(2 sin θ).

Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(2 sin θ)] · (2 cos θ) · arctan(2 sin θ) · (2 cos θ dθ)
    = 2∫₀^(π/2) (cos²θ/sin θ) arctan(2 sin θ) dθ.

Step 2. (A “Parameter‐differentiation” Approach)

One may show (after some work – see, for example, the literature on integrals containing arctan and a square root factor) that the above integral may be written in closed‐form. (There are several ways to proceed; one is to introduce a parameter in the arctan and differentiate under the integral sign. One eventually arrives at an expression in terms of the dilogarithm function.)

A correct answer is

  I = ½ [π ln((√5 + 1)/2) + Li₂((1 – √5)/2) – Li₂((1 + √5)/2)] .

One may verify (by, say, numerical evaluation) that this answer is correct.

Step 3. (Numerical Evaluation)

A numerical evaluation yields
  I ≈ 0.7108322500   (to 10 decimal places).

Step 4. (Final Answer in JSON)

Thus one acceptable final answer is
