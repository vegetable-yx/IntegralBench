We start with the integral

  I = ∫ from -1 to 1 of x² · ∛(x³ + 1) dx.

Step 1. Use the substitution u = x³ + 1, so that du/dx = 3x², or x² dx = du/3.

Step 2. Change the limits: when x = -1, u = (-1)³ + 1 = 0; when x = 1, u = 1³ + 1 = 2. The integral becomes

  I = (1/3)∫ from 0 to 2 of u^(1/3) du.

Step 3. Integrate u^(1/3):

  ∫ u^(1/3) du = (3/4) u^(4/3).

Thus, I = (1/3)*(3/4)[u^(4/3)] evaluated from 0 to 2 = (1/4)*(2^(4/3) - 0) = 2^(4/3)⁄4.

Step 4. Compute the numerical approximation. Since 2^(4/3) ≈ 2.519842099789746, we have

  I ≈ 2.519842099789746/4 ≈ 0.6299605249474365.

Rounding to 10 decimal places, we obtain: 0.6299605249
