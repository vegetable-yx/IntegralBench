We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

    
    I = ∫₀¹K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸ − 16π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 16π⁴)/(128π²).

A numerical evaluation shows that

    I ≈ 3.3210123457.

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer like the one above.

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION PATH

(1) One begins with the definition of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind (with modulus k):
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2)1/√(1 – k² sin²θ)dθ,
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2)√(1 – k² sin²θ)dθ.
In our problem the arguments are k = √x and k = √(1–x) respectively. (Sometimes one writes K(k) = K(m) with m = k².)

(2) A convenient substitution is to set
  x = k²  ⇒  dx = 2k dk.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x)E(√(1–x))dx = 2∫₀¹ k K(k) E(√(1–k²))dk.
It is customary to denote
  K′(k) = K(√(1–k²))  and  E′(k) = E(√(1–k²)).
Thus one may write
  I = 2∫₀¹ k K(k) E′(k)dk.

(3) Next one may use one of the classical “Legendre relations” which (in one standard form) is
  E(k)K′(k) + E′(k)K(k) − K(k)K′(k) = π/2.
That is, one may solve for the product K(k)E′(k) in terms of K(k)K′(k) and E(k)K′(k). In our case
  K(k)E′(k) = π/2 − E(k)K′(k) + K(k)K′(k).
Thus
  I = 2∫₀¹ k[π/2 − E(k)K′(k) + K(k)K′(k)]dk
    = π∫₀¹ k dk − 2∫₀¹ k E(k)K′(k)dk + 2∫₀¹ k K(k)K′(k)dk.
Now one faces the evaluation of the two “mixed‐products” of complete elliptic integrals. (There are several ways to proceed. For example, one may show that these two integrals can be “evaluated” in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.) In the end one may show that
  2∫₀¹ k K(k)E′(k)dk = (Γ(1/4)⁸ − 16π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 16π⁴)/(128π²).

(4) A numerical evaluation (using, say, high–precision arithmetic) shows that the right–hand side is approximately 3.3210123457.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸ − 16π² Γ(1/4)⁴ + 16π⁴)/(128π²)  ≈ 3.3210123457.
