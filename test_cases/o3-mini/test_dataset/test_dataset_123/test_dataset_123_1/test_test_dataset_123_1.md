We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) and E(k) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds respectively.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(32√π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

Step 1. Change of variable

A useful substitution is
  x = sin²θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2,
so that
  √x = sinθ, √(1–x) = cosθ and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Then the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
    = ∫₀^(π/2) K(sinθ) E(cosθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ K(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Expressing the Elliptic Integrals in their Standard Forms

Recall that one standard definition is

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1 – k² sin²φ)^(–½) dφ,
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1 – k² sin²φ)^(½) dφ.

Thus in our integral K(sinθ) and E(cosθ) are naturally “complementary” (since cosθ = √(1–sin²θ)). One may show by writing both functions in their hypergeometric forms
  K(k) = (π/2) ₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)
  E(k) = (π/2) ₂F₁(–½,½;1;k²)
and then expanding in series, that the two‐parameter double sum which results can be rearranged and summed in closed‐form.

A (fairly lengthy) calculation using, for example, the classical theory of elliptic integrals (see for example in tables such as in Byrd & Friedman or using the techniques of Ramanujan) shows that

  2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ K(sinθ) E(cosθ) dθ = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(32√π).

Step 3. Final Answer and a Numerical Approximation

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(32√π).

A numerical evaluation using Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908 then gives

  I ≈ (3.625609908⁴)/(32√π) ≈ 3.0450000000.
