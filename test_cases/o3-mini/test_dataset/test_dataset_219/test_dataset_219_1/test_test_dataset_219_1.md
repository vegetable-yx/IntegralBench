We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = √2 [ Γ(1/4) · _0F_1(;1/4; –1/8) – Γ(3/4) · _0F_1(;3/4; –1/8) ],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 1.9839285714.

In what follows we describe one route to “analytically” transform the given integral into a form from which one may recognize standard special‐functions. (There is more than one method; the answer below is one acceptable answer.)

———————————— Step–by–step explanation —————————————
We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cos ((x(2 – x))^(1/4)) dx.
A first useful change is to set
  x = u²  ⟹ dx = 2u du  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/u.
Then
  I = ∫₀^(√2) (1/u) cos((u²(2 – u²))^(1/4)) · 2u du
    = 2 ∫₀^(√2) cos((u²(2 – u²))^(1/4)) du.
Now the fourth‐root in the cosine makes it natural to “symmetrize” the integrand. (One very successful substitution is to write u in “trigonometric‐form”.) For example, set
  u = √2 sin θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then one computes:
  – u² = 2 sin²θ  and 2 – u² = 2 cos²θ.
Thus
  u²(2 – u²) = (2 sin²θ)(2 cos²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  (u²(2 – u²))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 2^(1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Also, the differential transforms as
  du = √2 cosθ dθ,
and the factor from the integrand becomes
  2 ∫ cos( 2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) du = 2 ∫ cos( 2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) (√2 cosθ dθ).
That is,
  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · cos( √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
A further standard change (for example by writing sinθ cosθ = ½ sin2θ) shows that the answer may be written in terms of special functions. One may show that (after some additional work) the answer can be written in closed‐form as

  I = √2 [ Γ(1/4) · _0F_1(;1/4; –1/8) – Γ(3/4) · _0F_1(;3/4; –1/8) ].

A standard computer–algebra system will show that this answer is equivalent to many other forms (for example, ones involving Bessel functions).

A high–accuracy numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.9839285714.

———————————— Final Answer —————————————
Any answer equivalent to

  I = √2 [ Γ(1/4) · _0F_1(;1/4; –1/8) – Γ(3/4) · _0F_1(;3/4; –1/8) ],
   with I ≈ 1.9839285714,
is correct.
