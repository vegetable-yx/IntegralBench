We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₁^(π/3) sec(x) [tan(x) log(x) + 1/x] dx.

Step 1. Recognize the Integrand as a Derivative

Notice that if we define
  F(x) = log(x) sec(x),
then by the product rule, we have
  F′(x) = (d/dx)(log(x)) · sec(x) + log(x) · (d/dx)(sec(x))
       = (1/x) sec(x) + log(x) sec(x) tan(x).

That is exactly our integrand.

Step 2. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Since F′(x) equals the integrand, we may write
  I = F(π/3) − F(1).

Computing F(π/3):
  F(π/3) = log(π/3) sec(π/3).

But sec(π/3) = 1/cos(π/3) = 1/(1/2) = 2. So,
  F(π/3) = 2 log(π/3).

Computing F(1):
  F(1) = log(1) sec(1) = 0 · sec(1) = 0  (since log(1) = 0).

Thus,
  I = 2 log(π/3) − 0 = 2 log(π/3).

Step 3. Numerical Approximation

We now approximate the result numerically. Noting that
  π ≈ 3.141592653589793 ⇒ π/3 ≈ 1.047197551196598.
Then using a calculator,
  log(π/3) ≈ 0.04611759718.
Thus,
  I ≈ 2 × 0.04611759718 ≈ 0.09223519436.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this gives
  I ≈ 0.0922351944.
