We start with the integral

  I = ∫₁^(π/3) sec(x) (tan(x) log(x) + 1/x) dx.

Notice that if we define
  f(x) = log(x) sec(x),
then its derivative is
  f′(x) = (d/dx(log(x))) sec(x) + log(x) d/dx(sec(x))
       = (1/x) sec(x) + log(x) sec(x) tan(x).

This is exactly the integrand of I. Thus we have

  I = f(π/3) − f(1) = log(π/3) sec(π/3) − log(1) sec(1).

Since log(1) = 0 and sec(π/3) = 2 (because cos(π/3) = 1/2), it follows that

  I = 2 log(π/3).

Now, to provide a numerical approximation, we compute:
  I ≈ 2 · log(π/3).

Using π ≈ 3.1415926536 we have
  π/3 ≈ 1.0471975512,
thus
  log(1.0471975512) ≈ 0.04611759718.
Multiplying by 2 gives
  I ≈ 0.09223519436.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, I ≈ 0.0922351944.
