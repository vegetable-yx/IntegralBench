We start with the integral

  I = ∫₁^(π/3) sec(x) [tan(x) log(x) + (1/x)] dx.

Notice that if we differentiate f(x) = log(x) sec(x), we obtain

  f '(x) = (d/dx)[log(x)] sec(x) + log(x) (d/dx)[sec(x)]
     = (1/x) sec(x) + log(x) sec(x) tan(x).

This exactly matches the integrand. Hence,

  I = [log(x) sec(x)] evaluated from x = 1 to x = π/3.

Evaluating at the limits:

At x = π/3: sec(π/3) = 1/cos(π/3) = 1/(1/2) = 2, so we have log(π/3) sec(π/3) = 2 log(π/3).

At x = 1: log(1) = 0, so log(1) sec(1) = 0.

Thus, the exact answer is

  I = 2 log(π/3).

For the numerical approximation, we note that
  π/3 ≈ 1.0471975512,
so log(π/3) ≈ 0.046117597, and therefore
  I ≈ 2 × 0.046117597 ≈ 0.092235194.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical approximation is 0.0922351940.
