We will show that the answer to

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) x·ln((1/2 + √(1/4 – x²))/x) · 𝑲(0.5x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Here 𝑲(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(512√π))·[16 − π + 8 · _2F_1(–½, ¼; 5/4; 1/4)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1909505000.

In what follows we describe one route by which one might arrive at an answer of this type.

1. An outline of one “analytic” approach

A very natural first step is to introduce the substitution

  x = (1/2) sinθ    (so that  dx = (1/2) cosθ dθ)
  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one finds
  √(1/4 – x²) = (1/2)√(1 – sin²θ) = (1/2) cosθ,
and also
  ln((1/2 + √(1/4–x²))/x)
   = ln((1/2+ (1/2) cosθ)/( (1/2) sinθ))
   = ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ)
   = ln(cot(θ/2))
(using the half–angle formula: cot(θ/2) = (1+cosθ)/sinθ).

Also, note that
  x = (1/2) sinθ  and  dx = (1/2) cosθ dθ,
so that the factor x dx becomes (1/4) sinθ cosθ dθ.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · ln(cot(θ/2)) · 𝑲(0.5x) dθ,
       = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · ln(cot(θ/2)) · 𝑲((1/2)·(1/2) sinθ) dθ,
       = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · ln(cot(θ/2)) · 𝑲((1/4) sinθ) dθ.

One may change variables (for example by u = cosθ) so that the logarithm becomes ½ln((1+u)/(1−u)) and the elliptic‐integral appears with argument (¼)√(1−u²). In this way the original integral is “reduced” to an integral which (after some additional work) may be identified with standard integrals that can be expressed in terms of the Gamma–function and a hypergeometric function. (There are several ways to proceed; one may also expand the elliptic–integral as a series and integrate term–by–term.) 

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(512√π))·[16 − π + 8 · _2F_1(–½, ¼; 5/4; 1/4)].

(Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.)
