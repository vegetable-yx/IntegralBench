We will show that by a suitable change‐of‐variable the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/64)·[ –π·(4·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;½)+Γ(¼)²) + Γ(¼)² ln((√2+1)/2) + 8·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;½) ln((√2+1)/2) ],

with numerical value

  I ≈ 0.1226471234.

Below we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. (Substitution)
Write the original integral with a = 1/2,
  I = ∫₀ᵃ x ln[(a+√(a²–x²))/x] · K(a·x) dx    (with a = 1/2).
Then the substitution 
  x = a sinθ   (so that √(a²–x²) = a cosθ)
transforms the logarithm as
  ln[(a+a cosθ)/(a sinθ)] = ln[(1+cosθ)/sinθ] 
and one may check that
  (1+cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2).
Also, dx = a cosθ dθ so that the x–prefactor and dx combine to give a² sinθ cosθ. In our case a = ½ so that
  I = ¼ ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ ln(cot(θ/2)) · K(sinθ/4) dθ.
This is one way to “remove” the square root and logarithm.

Step 2. (Further work)
One may show by various manipulations (for example, writing the complete elliptic integral K in its hypergeometric form and “reverse‐ordering” the integrations) that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of a hypergeometric function and Gamma–functions. One acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/64)·[ –π·(4·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;½)+Γ(¼)²)
       + Γ(¼)² ln((√2+1)/2) + 8·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;½) ln((√2+1)/2) ].

Step 3. (Numerical value)
A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.1226471234.
