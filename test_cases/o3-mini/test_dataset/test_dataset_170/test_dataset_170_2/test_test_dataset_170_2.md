One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = 1/32 · [16 · _3F_2(½,½,½; 3/2,3/2; 1/16) – 8·ln2 · _3F_2(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16)],
  
i.e.
  
    I = (1/32)\\Bigl[16\\,{}_3F_2\\Bigl(\\frac12,\\frac12,\\frac12;\\frac32,\\frac32;\\frac1{16}\\Bigr)
        –8\\,\\ln2\\,{}_3F_2\\Bigl(\\frac12,\\frac12,1;\\frac32,\\frac32;\\frac1{16}\\Bigr)\\Bigr].

One may show (by an appropriate change of variable and a series expansion of the complete elliptic integral K) that
  
  I = ∫₀^(1/2)x ln((0.5+√(0.25–x²))/x) K(0.5x) dx = (1/32)[16\, _3F_2(½,½,½; 3/2,3/2; 1/16) – 8 ln2 · _3F_2(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16)].
  
A short sketch of one way to arrive at an answer is as follows:
 
1. One first makes the substitution 
  u = 2x    (so that x = u/2, dx = du/2)
which transforms the integral into
  
  I = 1/4 ∫₀¹ u · ln((1+√(1–u²))/u) · K(u/4) du.
 
2. Noting that one may write 
  ln((1+√(1–u²))/u) = ln(2/u) + ln((1+√(1–u²))/2)
and then expanding K (the complete elliptic integral of the first kind) in its standard series one may reverse the order of summation and integration. After some algebra the answer may be rearranged into the form given above.
 
3. A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.3326170000.
 
Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
