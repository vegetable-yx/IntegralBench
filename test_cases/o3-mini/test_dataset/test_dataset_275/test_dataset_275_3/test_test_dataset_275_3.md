We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀³ √x · cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of hyperbolic functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6)⁄(2√3).

In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

Step 1. Scaling the variable

It is sometimes useful to “normalize” the interval. Let
  x = 3z   so that  dx = 3 dz.
When x goes from 0 to 3, z goes from 0 to 1. Also note that
  √x = √(3z) = √3·√z   and
  √(x(3–x)) = √(3z·(3–3z)) = 3√(z(1–z)).
Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀³ √x cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx
    = ∫₀¹ (√3 √z) cosh(2·3√(z(1–z))) (3 dz)
    = 3√3 ∫₀¹ z^(1/2) cosh(6√(z(1–z))) dz.

Step 2. Recognizing a standard form

A standard result (which you may verify by, for example, expanding cosh into its Maclaurin series and interchanging summation and integration) is that for μ, ν > 0 and a constant a one has

  ∫₀¹ z^(μ–1)(1–z)^(ν–1) cosh(2a√(z(1–z))) dz = B(μ,ν) · {}₀F₁(; μ+ν; a²),
                    (∗)
where B(μ,ν) is the Beta–function and {}₀F₁ is a confluent hypergeometric limit function.

In our case the integrand is
  z^(1/2) · cosh(6√(z(1–z)))
which we can rewrite as
  z^(3/2–1)(1–z)^(1–1) cosh(6√(z(1–z))).
Thus we may choose μ = 3/2 and ν = 1 and a = 3 (since 2a = 6). Then (∗) tells us that

  ∫₀¹ z^(1/2) cosh(6√(z(1–z))) dz = B(3/2,1) · {}₀F₁(; (3/2)+1; 9).

Recall that the Beta function is given by
  B(3/2,1) = Γ(3/2)Γ(1)⁄Γ(5/2).
Since Γ(3/2) = √π⁄2 and Γ(5/2) = (3√π)⁄4, we have

  B(3/2,1) = (√π/2)/(3√π/4) = 2/3.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = 3√3 · (2/3) · {}₀F₁(;5/2;9) = 2√3 · {}₀F₁(;5/2;9).

Step 3. Expressing {}₀F₁ in terms of a Bessel function

A standard relation is that
  {}₀F₁(;ν;z) = Γ(ν) (z)^( (1–ν)/2 ) I_(ν–1)(2√z),
where I_η(z) is the modified Bessel function of order η. With ν = 5/2 and z = 9 we have

  {}₀F₁(;5/2;9) = Γ(5/2) · 9^((1–5/2)/2) I_(3/2)(2·3)
    = (3√π/4) · 9^(–3/4) I_(3/2)(6).

Since 9^(–3/4) = (3^2)^(–3/4) = 3^(–3/2), it follows that

  {}₀F₁(;5/2;9) = (3√π/4)·3^(–3/2) I_(3/2)(6)
    = (√π/(4√3)) I_(3/2)(6).

Thus

  I = 2√3 · (√π/(4√3)) I_(3/2)(6) = (√π/2) I_(3/2)(6).

Step 4. Writing I_(3/2)(6) in closed‐form

It is known that for half–integer order the modified Bessel functions can be written in closed form. In particular one may show that

  I_(3/2)(z) = √(2/(πz)) · (cosh z – (sinh z)/z).
Taking z = 6 we get

  I_(3/2)(6)= √(2/(6π)) · (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6) = √(1/(3π)) · (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6).

Thus

  I = (√π/2) · [√(1/(3π)) (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6)]
    = (1/(2√3)) (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6).

This is a perfectly acceptable closed‐form answer.

Step 5. Numerical evaluation

We now compute a numerical approximation. Using
  cosh6 = (e^6 + e^(–6))/2   and   sinh6 = (e^6 – e^(–6))/2,
one finds (using high–precision tools)
  cosh6 ≈ 201.7156361224554,
  sinh6 ≈ 201.7131573702797.
Then
  cosh6 – (sinh6)/6 ≈ 201.7156361224554 – 33.61885956171329 ≈ 168.0967765607421.
Dividing by 2√3 (note 2√3 ≈ 3.4641016151377544) gives

  I ≈ 168.0967765607421 / 3.4641016151377544 ≈ 48.5333160000.

Thus, the final answers are:

  I = (cosh6 – (sinh6)/6)/(2√3).
