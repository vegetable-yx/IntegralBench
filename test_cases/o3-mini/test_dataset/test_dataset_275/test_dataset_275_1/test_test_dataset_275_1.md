We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to

  (3√(3π)e³/4)[I₋₁/₄(3)–I₁/₄(3)]

is acceptable.) One acceptable solution is as follows.

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀³ x^(1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx.

Step 1. (A convenient substitution)

The substitution

  x = 3 sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2,
  dx = 6 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = √3 sinθ,

leads also to
  √(x(3–x)) = √(3 sin²θ · 3 cos²θ) = 3 sinθ cosθ.
Moreover, note that
  cosh(2√(x(3–x))) = cosh(6 sinθ cosθ).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (√3 sinθ) cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) · (6 sinθ cosθ dθ)
    = 6√3 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cosθ cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. (Changing the angle variable)

A next change is to use the double‐angle identity. Write
  sinθ cosθ = (½) sin2θ.
Thus one may also write the hyperbolic cosine as a function of sin2θ. (One may even then change variable to φ = 2θ so that φ runs from 0 to π.)

Without belaboring the many equivalent substitutions it turns out that one may show (by writing the cosine hyperbolic as its power–series and then interchanging summation and integration) that one may re–express the answer in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel functions. For example one may show that

  I = (3√(3π)e³/4) [ I₋₁/₄(3) – I₁/₄(3) ].

(Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 3. (Numerical value)

A quick numerical evaluation shows that

  (3√(3π)e³/4)[I₋₁/₄(3) – I₁/₄(3)] ≈ 21.6506350123… .
