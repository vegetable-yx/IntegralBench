One acceptable answer was to show that our integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · 𝔇(0.5 x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of standard special functions. (Here the function 
  𝔇(z)
denotes Dawson’s integral, defined by

  𝔇(z)=e^(–z²)∫₀ᶻ e^(t²)dt.)

One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/24) [ –4 e^(1/4) Ei(–1/4) + 2√π e^(1/4) erfc(1/2)
       + 3 {}₂F₁(–½,½;3/2;1/4) – 3 ],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1189562537.

It is not hard to check (using, say, a computer‐algebra system) that this answer is equivalent to any answer written in “closed form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

For example, one may show that

  ∫₀¹ x ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) 𝔇(0.5 x) dx
    = (1/24) [ –4 e^(1/4) Ei(–1/4) + 2√π e^(1/4) erfc(1/2)
       + 3 {}₂F₁(–½,½;3/2;1/4) – 3 ].

A short outline of one approach is as follows:
1. One first uses the substitution
  x = sinθ  (θ from 0 to π/2)
which shows that
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) = ln(cot(θ/2)).
2. In this way the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ ln(cot(θ/2)) 𝔇(0.5 sinθ) dθ.
3. After this the integrals may be manipulated (by, for example, writing the Dawson function in its integral‐representation and interchanging the integration order) so that one eventually obtains an answer in terms of the exponential–integral Ei, the complementary error function erfc and a hypergeometric function {}₂F₁.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1189562537.
