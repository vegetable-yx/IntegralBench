One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of standard special functions. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/8) [ –e^(1/4) Ei(–1/4) + 2 ln 2 + 2γ − 2 · _2F_1(–½, ½; 3/2; –1/4) ],

i.e. in LaTeX‐notation

  I = \frac{1}{8}\Bigl[-e^{\frac{1}{4}}\Ei\Bigl(-\frac{1}{4}\Bigr)+2\ln2+2\gamma-2\,_2F_1\Bigl(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2};\frac{3}{2};-\frac{1}{4}\Bigr)\Bigr].

One may show (by a suitable change of variable, for example x = sin θ, and then “un‐winding” the resulting integrals by first writing the Dawson function in its defining integral form and interchanging integrations) that the original integral

  I=\int_{0}^{1}x\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\;\mathbf{D}(0.5x)dx

can be expressed in this way. (Here Ei(z) denotes the exponential‐integral, γ is Euler’s constant, and _2F_1 is the Gauss hypergeometric function. Note that the function D(·) in the integrand is taken to be the Dawson function.) 

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1190500000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
