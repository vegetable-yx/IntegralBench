We will show that the given integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x ln((1 + √(1 – x²))/x) · 𝔻(0.5x) dx
can be written in a simpler form. In our case the notation 𝔻(0.5x) is understood to denote the differential d(0.5x); that is, 
  d(0.5x) = 0.5 dx.
Thus we may rewrite the integral as

  I = ∫₀¹ x ln((1 + √(1 – x²))/x) · d(0.5x)
    = 0.5 ∫₀¹ x ln((1 + √(1 – x²))/x) dx.

We now call

  J = ∫₀¹ x ln((1 + √(1 – x²))/x) dx,
so that I = 0.5 J.

Step 1. Write the logarithm as a difference. Notice that

  ln((1 + √(1 – x²))/x) = ln(1 + √(1 – x²)) − ln x.

Thus

  J = ∫₀¹ x ln(1 + √(1 – x²)) dx − ∫₀¹ x ln x dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the simpler second integral.
The integral

  I₂ = ∫₀¹ x ln x dx

can be computed by integration by parts (or by recalling a standard formula). In fact one finds

  I₂ = [x²/2 (ln x − 1/2)]₀¹ = (1/2·(0 − 1/2)) = −1/4.

Step 3. Evaluate the first integral.
Denote

  I₁ = ∫₀¹ x ln(1 + √(1 – x²)) dx.
It is advantageous to make the substitution

  x = sin θ,  so that  dx = cos θ dθ  and  √(1 – x²) = cos θ.
When x runs from 0 to 1, θ runs from 0 to π/2. Then

  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ ln(1 + cosθ) cosθ dθ
    = ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ ln(1 + cosθ) dθ.

Now set u = cosθ so that du = − sinθ dθ. When θ = 0, u = 1 and when θ = π/2, u = 0. Then

  I₁ = ∫₍u=1₎^(0) u ln(1 + u) (−du)
    = ∫₀¹ u ln(1 + u) du.

We now compute

  I₁ = ∫₀¹ u ln(1 + u) du.
Use integration by parts. Let

  v = ln(1 + u)  ⇒  dv = 1/(1 + u) du,
  dw = u du    ⇒  w = u²/2.
Then

  I₁ = [u²/2 · ln(1 + u)]₀¹ − ∫₀¹ (u²/2)·(1/(1 + u)) du
    = (1/2 ln2) − (1/2) ∫₀¹ (u²/(1 + u)) du.

To evaluate the remaining integral we perform polynomial division:
  u²/(1+u) = u − 1 + 1/(1+u).
Thus

  ∫₀¹ u²/(1+u) du = ∫₀¹ (u − 1) du + ∫₀¹ 1/(1+u) du.
Now, compute each piece:
  ∫₀¹ (u − 1) du = [u²/2 − u]₀¹ = (1/2 − 1) = −1/2,
  ∫₀¹ 1/(1+u) du = [ln(1+u)]₀¹ = ln 2.
So, the integral is
  ∫₀¹ u²/(1+u) du = −1/2 + ln 2.
Thus

  I₁ = 1/2 ln 2 − (1/2)(−1/2 + ln 2)
    = 1/2 ln 2 − 1/2 ln 2 + 1/4
    = 1/4.

Step 4. Combine the pieces.
Recall that

  J = I₁ − I₂ = (1/4) − (−1/4) = 1/2.
And then

  I = 0.5 J = 0.5 · (1/2) = 1/4.

Thus the exact answer is 1/4.

Step 5. Provide the numerical approximation.
Since 1/4 = 0.25, when rounded to 10 decimal places we have 0.2500000000.
