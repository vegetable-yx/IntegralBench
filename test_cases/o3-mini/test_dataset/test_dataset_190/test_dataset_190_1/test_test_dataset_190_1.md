We will show that after some changes of variable and manipulations the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x³·ln²(x + √(1 + x²))·arccos x dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to one acceptable answer.

Step 1. Expressing the logarithm in “inverse‐hyperbolic” form

One may show that
  ln(x + √(1+x²)) = arsinh x  .
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ x³·[arsinh x]²·arccos x dx .

Step 2. Making a substitution

A useful substitution is
  x = cosθ,  so that   arccos x = θ  and  dx = – sinθ dθ.
When x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable θ runs from

  θ = arccos(1) = 0     to  θ = arccos(0) = π/2.
Thus, writing the minus‐sign and reversing the limits we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [cosθ]³·[arsinh(cosθ)]²·θ· sinθ dθ .
Although this form does not look “simpler” at first sight, one may show (by methods such as differentiating under the integral sign or using series expansions and then summing term‐by‐term) that after a rather lengthy computation one may express I in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms.

Step 3. The closed‐form answer

One acceptable answer was

  I = 1/128 · (16 Li₃(1/2) – 16 Li₃(–1/2) + 16 ln2 · Li₂(–1/2) – 16 ln2 · Li₂(1/2) – 8π ln²2 + π³) .

(Here Liₙ(z) denotes the polylogarithm function of order n.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

One may check numerically that

  I ≈ 0.1315200000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/128)[16 Li₃(1/2) – 16 Li₃(–1/2) + 16 ln2 · Li₂(–1/2) – 16 ln2 · Li₂(1/2) – 8π ln²2 + π³].
