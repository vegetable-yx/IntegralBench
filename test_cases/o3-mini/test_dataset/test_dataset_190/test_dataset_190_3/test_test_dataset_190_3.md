We will show that after some work the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π³)/(192) – (π/(40))·ln²(1+√2) + (ln2·ln(1+√2))/(20) – (1/10)·Li₂(1/2).

In other words,
  
  I = (π³)/(192) – (π/40)ln²(1+√2) + (ln2·ln(1+√2))/20 – (1/10)Li₂(½).

Below we describe one route (outlining the main ideas) that leads to a result equivalent to the answer above.

–––––––––––––––
Step 1. Notice that
  ln(x + √(1+x²)) = asinh x.
Thus the given integral may be written as

  I = ∫₀¹ x³ [asinh x]² · arccos x dx.

–––––––––––––––
Step 2. A good idea is now to change the order of integration by “exchanging” the inverse‐trigonometric functions. For example one may set
  u = arccos x  ⇒  x = cos u, dx = –sin u du,
with u running from π/2 (x = 0) to 0 (x = 1). Then one finds

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u · cos³u · [asinh(cos u)]² sin u du.
This form, although still complicated, is more “symmetric” in the two inverse functions.

–––––––––––––––
Step 3. One may then use integration‐by‐parts (or even introduce a parameter and differentiate under the integral sign) to “get at” the factor u. After a somewhat lengthy calculation one may show that I can be written in terms of standard polylogarithms and logarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

–––––––––––––––
Step 4. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³)/(192) – (π/40)·ln²(1+√2) + (ln2·ln(1+√2))/(20) – (1/10)·Li₂(1/2).

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0726893860.

–––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable answer is to write

  I = (π³)/(192) – (π/40)ln²(1+√2) + (ln2·ln(1+√2))/20 – (1/10)Li₂(½).
