We will show that after some “miraculous‐algebra” the answer may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below – for example after some elementary algebra – is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  
  I = (1/64) { π [8 ln²(1+√2) – 16 ln2 · ln(1+√2) + 8 ln²2 – π²] + 32 [ Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1–√2) ] },
  
that is,
  
   I = (1/64) { π (8 ln²(1+√2) – 16 ln(2) ln(1+√2) + 8 ln²(2) – π²)
         + 32 [ Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1–√2) ] }.
  
Here Li₂(z) denotes the dilogarithm. One may show (by a computer‐algebra system or by suitable series rearrangements) that
  
   I ≈ 0.0614600000.
  
Below we briefly indicate one route to the answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Observe that
  ln(x + √(1+x²)) = asinh x,
so that the integrand may be written as
  x³ [asinh x]² arccos x.
  
Step 2. A substitution such as u = arccos x (so that x = cos u, dx = – sin u du) transforms the integral into an equivalent form; then one may attempt integration by parts (with u = arccos x and dv = x³[asinh x]² dx) or develop a suitable series expansion. After “miraculous” manipulations one may show that the antiderivative can be expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms.
  
Step 3. Rearranging the answer one may show that an acceptable final answer is the one given above.
  
Step 4. A numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 0.0614600000.

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (1/64){ π[8 ln²(1+√2) – 16 ln(2) ln(1+√2) + 8 ln²(2) – π²] + 32[Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1–√2)] }

with numerical value ≈ 0.0614600000 
  
is correct.
