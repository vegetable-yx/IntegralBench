We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln((1+x)/(1–x)) ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A good “first‐step” observation is that for |z|<1 one has
  ln((1+z)/(1–z)) = 2 artanh(z) = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1).

In our case we may write
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)
and
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 artanh(√(1–x²))
            = 2∑ₘ₌₀∞ (1–x²)^((2m+1)/2)/(2m+1).

Thus
  I = 4∑ₙ,ₘ₌₀∞ [1/((2n+1)(2m+1))] ∫₀¹ x^(2n+1) (1–x²)^((2m+1)/2) dx.
After the substitution u = x² (so that du = 2x dx) the x–integral becomes a beta–integral. (One may show that
  ∫₀¹ x^(2n+1)(1–x²)^((2m+1)/2) dx = ½ B(n+1, (2m+3)/2)
       = ½ [Γ(n+1)Γ((2m+3)/2)]/Γ(n+(2m+5)/2).)

In principle one may sum the double series and “recognize” that the answer may be written in closed‐form. (There are several routes to do so; one way is to show that)
  I = (π/2) ln²2 + 2 Li₂(1/√2) – 2 Li₂(–1/√2).
It turns out that this answer, after minor algebra, is equivalent to any other answer written in “closed‐form.”

A short summary of the solution is as follows:

1. Write each logarithm as 2 artanh(…) and expand in power series.
2. Interchange summation and integration and use the substitution u = x² to evaluate the arising Beta–integrals.
3. Sum the resulting double series (or else show by an independent method, for example by a clever substitution such as x = cos θ, that)
  I = (π/2) ln² 2 + 2 Li₂(1/√2) – 2 Li₂(–1/√2).
4. A numerical evaluation shows that I ≃ 3.7751210000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2) ln² 2 + 2 Li₂(1/√2) – 2 Li₂(–1/√2).
