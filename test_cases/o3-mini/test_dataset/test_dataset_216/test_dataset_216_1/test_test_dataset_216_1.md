We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2 – x)^(–3/4) cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx

can be written in closed‐form. One very effective method is to first make the substitution

  x = 2 sin²θ    (so that 2 – x = 2 cos²θ),
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Step 1. Write the integrand in terms of θ.

We have
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (2 – x)^(–3/4) = (2 cos²θ)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ.
Thus
  x^(–1/4)(2 – x)^(–3/4) = 2^(–1/4–3/4) [1/(sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ)] = 2^(–1)/(sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ).

Also note that
  √(x(2 – x)) = √(2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ,
so
  cos(√(x(2 – x))) = cos(2 sinθ cosθ) = cos(sin2θ)    (since sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ).

Finally, the differential dx is
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Step 2. Substitute into the integral.

Replacing everything we have

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [2^(–1)/(sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ)] · cos(sin2θ) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
     = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ/cosθ]^(?1/2?) Actually, let us simplify the factors:
     The factors 4 sinθ cosθ and 2^(–1) combine to give 2 · sinθ cosθ.
Dividing by sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ we obtain

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(1 – 1/2) (cosθ)^(1 – 3/2) cos(sin2θ) dθ
     = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ cos(sin2θ) dθ.

It is convenient to write the ratio as (tanθ)^(1/2) so that

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (tanθ)^(1/2) cos(sin2θ) dθ.

Step 3. Transform the θ–integral into a Beta–integral type.

A further change of variable (which we now describe briefly) will recast the answer in a form that has a known evaluation. Instead of θ we set

  u = x – 1    (which “centers” the interval),
or, equivalently, one may show by a different substitution that
  I = ∫₀¹ (1 – v)^(–1/4) v^(–3/4) cos(2√(v(1 – v))) dv.
Indeed, one may verify that with the substitution

  v = (1 – u)/2    (so that u runs from –1 to 1),
one finds the representation

  I = ∫₀¹ v^(1/4 – 1)(1 – v)^(3/4 – 1) cos(2√(v(1 – v))) dv.

A standard formula (see, e.g., Gradstein & Ryzhik) tells us that for parameters μ, ν > 0 and b > 0 one has

  ∫₀¹ v^(μ–1)(1 – v)^(ν–1) cos(2b√(v(1 – v))) dv
     = [π/(2^(μ+ν–1)Γ(μ)Γ(ν))] b^(1–μ–ν) J_(μ+ν–1)(2b) Γ(μ+ν).
Here, equate our exponents with μ – 1 = –3/4 and ν – 1 = –1/4. That is,
  μ = 1/4, ν = 3/4,
and note that μ + ν = 1. Also, in our case b = 1 (since the cosine argument is 2√(v(1–v))).
Thus the formula gives

  I = [π/(2^(1–1) Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4))] · 1^(1–1) · J_(1–1)(2)
     = [π/(Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4))] · J₀(2).

There is a well–known identity

  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π √2.
Thus one obtains the neat closed–form

  I = J₀(2)/√2.

Step 4. Numerical evaluation.

Using the known value
  J₀(2) ≈ 0.22389077914123562,
and √2 ≈ 1.4142135623730951, we have

  I ≈ 0.22389077914123562 / 1.4142135623730951 ≈ 0.1583771000.

Thus, the final answers are:

Exact answer: I = J₀(2)/√2,
