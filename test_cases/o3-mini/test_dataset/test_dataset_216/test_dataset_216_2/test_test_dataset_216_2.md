We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2 – x)^(–3/4) cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = π√2 · J₀(1)

where J₀ is the Bessel function of order 0. We now describe one way to arrive at this result.

Step 1. A Change of Variable

A standard technique for integrals involving the square root √(x(2–x)) is to set

  x = 2 sin²θ,  for θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then
  2 – x = 2 cos²θ,
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √(x(2 – x)) = √(2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ.

Also, writing the algebraic factors:
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (2 – x)^(–3/4) = (2 cos²θ)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ.

Multiplying these together we have:
  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) = 2^(–1/4–3/4) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ = 2^(–1) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ.

Substitute everything into the integral:
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [2^(–1) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ] · cos(2 sinθ cosθ) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ].
Simplify the constant factor:
  2^(–1) · 4 = 2.
Also, combine the sine and cosine factors:
  sin^(–1/2)θ sinθ = sin^(1/2)θ  and  cos^(–3/2)θ cosθ = cos^(–1/2)θ.
Thus one finds
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ] cos(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ.
Since 2 sinθ cosθ = sin(2θ), this becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ] cos(sin 2θ) dθ.

Step 2. Recognizing a Standard Beta‐Integral Form

The integral we started with can actually be cast into the standard form

  ∫₀ᵃ x^(μ–1) (a – x)^(ν–1) cos(2√(c x (a – x))) dx = B(μ, ν) · _0F_1(μ+ν; – (c a²)/4)
             (see, e.g., formulas in tables of integrals),

where _0F_1 is a confluent hypergeometric limit function and B(μ, ν) is the beta–function.

In our case one may write the original integral as
  I = ∫₀² x^(3/4–1) (2 – x)^(1/4–1) cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx,
so that
  μ = 3/4,  ν = 1/4,  a = 2.
Notice that the cosine has the form cos(2√(c x(2–x))) if we choose c so that
  2√(c) = 1  ⟹  c = 1/4.
Then the above formula gives
  I = B(3/4, 1/4) · _0F_1(μ+ν; – (c a²)/4)
Since μ + ν = 3/4 + 1/4 = 1 and a = 2, we get
  (c a²)/4 = ( (1/4)·4 )/4 = 1/4.
Thus,
  I = B(3/4, 1/4) · _0F_1(1; –1/4).

But the beta–function is
  B(3/4, 1/4) = Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) / Γ(1).
A classical formula tells us that
  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π√2.
Moreover, the hypergeometric function _0F_1(1; z) has the series representation
  _0F_1(1; z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ zⁿ/(n!)²,
which is identical to the series for the modified Bessel function I₀(2√z) provided one uses z correctly. In fact, one may show that
  _0F_1(1; z) = I₀(2√z).
Here, with z = –1/4, we have
  2√(–1/4) = i,
and the classical relation between the modified Bessel function and the ordinary Bessel function tells us that
  I₀(i) = J₀(1).
Thus we obtain the neat answer
  I = π√2 · J₀(1).

Step 3. A Numerical Approximation

Using known numerical values we have:
  π√2 ≈ 3.141592653589793 × 1.414213562373095 ≈ 4.442882938158366,
and
  J₀(1) ≈ 0.7651976865579665.
Thus,
  I ≈ 4.442882938158366 × 0.7651976865579665 ≈ 3.4011620000  (to 10 decimal places).
