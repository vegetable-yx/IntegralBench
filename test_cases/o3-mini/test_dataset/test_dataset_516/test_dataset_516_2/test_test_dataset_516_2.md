We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀∞ [tanh(x) / exp(x)] dx = ∫₀∞ tanh(x)e^(–x) dx.

Step 1. Write tanh(x) in a convenient form.
Recall that
  tanh(x) = 1 – 2/(exp(2x) + 1).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀∞ e^(–x) dx – 2∫₀∞ [e^(–x)/(exp(2x) + 1)] dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the first term.
The integral is straightforward:
  ∫₀∞ e^(–x) dx = [–e^(–x)]₀∞ = 1.

So we have

  I = 1 – 2I₁,
  where I₁ = ∫₀∞ e^(–x)/(1 + exp(2x)) dx.

Step 3. Transform I₁ via substitution.
Let u = e^x so that when x = 0, u = 1 and when x → ∞, u → ∞.
Also, dx = du/u and note that e^(–x) = 1/u and exp(2x) = u². Thus, I₁ becomes

  I₁ = ∫₍u=1₎^(∞) [1/u] / [1 + u²] · (du/u) = ∫₁∞ du/(u²(1 + u²)).

Step 4. Partial fractions for the integrand.
Notice that we can decompose:
  1/(u²(1+u²)) = 1/u² – 1/(1+u²).
This is verified by writing
  1/u² – 1/(1+u²) = (1+u² – u²)/(u²(1+u²)) = 1/(u²(1+u²)).

So
  I₁ = ∫₁∞ [1/u² – 1/(1+u²)] du.

Step 5. Integrate term by term.
First term:
  ∫ du/u² = –1/u.
Second term:
  ∫ du/(1+u²) = arctan(u).

Thus,
  I₁ = [–1/u – arctan(u)] evaluated from u = 1 to u → ∞.

Compute the limits:
• As u → ∞: –1/u → 0 and arctan(u) → π/2. So the upper limit is [0 – π/2] = –π/2.
• At u = 1: –1/1 – arctan(1) = –1 – (π/4).

Thus,
  I₁ = (–π/2) – (–1 – π/4) = –π/2 + 1 + π/4 = 1 – (π/4).

Step 6. Substitute back into I.
We had
  I = 1 – 2I₁ = 1 – 2(1 – π/4) = 1 – 2 + (π/2) = (π/2) – 1.

Thus, the exact answer is

  I = (π/2) – 1   [Exact Answer].

Step 7. Numerical approximation.
We have
  π/2 ≈ 1.5707963268,
so  I ≈ 1.5707963268 – 1 = 0.5707963268.

The final result in the required JSON format is:
