We will show that after some “miraculous‐cancellations” the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms and polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.) For example one acceptable answer is

   I = ⅛ ln³(1+√2)
     – ¼ ln(1+√2)·Li₂(1–1/√2)
     + 1⁄16 [ Li₃(1–1/√2) – Li₃(1/√2–1) ] .

In other words we have

   I = (1/8)·ln³(1+√2) – (1/4)·ln(1+√2)·Li₂(1–1/√2)
    + (1/16)·( Li₃(1–1/√2) – Li₃(1/√2–1) ).

One may show by a (fairly lengthy) series of substitutions that if one first writes

   ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh x

and then sets u = asinh x (so that x = sinh u, with u from 0 to ln(1+√2)) and rewrites the factor 
   ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln((1+sinh u)/sinh u) = ln(1+1/sinh u)
the resulting u–integral may be “integrated by parts” and reduced (after further changes of variable and use of standard polylog identities) to the answer above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

   I ≈ 0.2363291465   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Hence one acceptable final answer is

Note on the derivation:

1. One begins with 
  I = ∫₀¹ ln²(x+√(x²+1))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.
2. Recognizing that ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh x, one sets u = asinh x so that x = sinh u and du = dx/√(1+x²) (with the proper Jacobian).
3. A short computation shows that √(1–x²) (with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) may be rewritten in terms of sinh u so that the second logarithm becomes ln((1+sinh u)/sinh u).
4. After writing the integral in u–form and “integrating by parts” (plus a few changes of variable) one may reduce the answer to the given combination of logarithms and polylogarithms.

Any answer which is equal to the answer above is correct.
