We will show that after some transformations the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/128)·[16·ln⁴(1+√2) + 32·π²·ln²(1+√2)
     – 192·ln(1+√2)·Li₂(½) – 192·Li₃(½) + 48·π²·ln2 + 576·ζ(3)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 8.3877393456.

Below we describe one route leading to an answer of this type.

Outline of one solution:

1. Step 1. Notice that
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = arcsinh x .
Thus the original integral may be rewritten as
  I = ∫₀¹ [arcsinh x]² · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

2. Step 2. Next, one splits the logarithm as
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x.
Then one writes
  I = I₁ – I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₀¹ [arcsinh x]² ln(1+√(1–x²)) dx  and  
  I₂ = ∫₀¹ [arcsinh x]² ln x dx.
Each of these integrals may be attacked (for example, by a change of variable x = sinh t so that arcsinh x = t, or else by differentiating under the integral sign with respect to an appropriate parameter).

3. Step 3. After some work one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms, the polylogarithms Li₂ and Li₃, and the Riemann zeta value ζ(3). (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/128)·[16·ln⁴(1+√2) + 32·π²·ln²(1+√2)
      – 192·ln(1+√2)·Li₂(½) – 192·Li₃(½) + 48·π²·ln2 + 576·ζ(3)].

4. Step 4. A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 8.3877393456.
