We want to compute
  I = ∫₀ᴨ cos(x + cos x) dx.

Step 1. Show that the integrand is antisymmetric about x = π/2.

Let f(x) = cos(x + cos x). Replace x by π – x. Then
  f(π – x) = cos((π – x) + cos(π – x)).
But cos(π – x) = –cos x, so
  f(π – x) = cos((π – x) – cos x)
       = cos(π – (x + cos x)).
Now, using the identity
  cos(π – θ) = –cos θ,
we obtain
  f(π – x) = – cos(x + cos x) = –f(x).

That is, f(π – x) = – f(x) so the integrand is antisymmetric about x = π/2.

Step 2. Use symmetry of the integration region.

Since the interval [0, π] is symmetric about π/2 and the integrand is an odd function (with respect to the midpoint π/2), the positive contributions cancel the negative contributions. Hence, the integral is zero:
  I = 0.

Step 3. Numerical approximation.

The numerical value of 0 is 0.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).

Thus, the final answer is:
