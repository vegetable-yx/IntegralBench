One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and a (generalized) hypergeometric function. For example one acceptable answer was

  
  \[
  \int_{0}^{2}\frac{1}{x^2}J_{2.5}(x)J_{0.5}(2-x)\,dx
  =
  -\frac{\Gamma\Bigl(-\frac14\Bigr)\;_1F_2\Bigl(-\tfrac14; \tfrac14,\tfrac32; -1\Bigr)}
  {8\,\Gamma\Bigl(\frac54\Bigr)}
  +\frac{\Gamma\Bigl(\frac14\Bigr)\;_1F_2\Bigl(\tfrac14; \tfrac34,\tfrac54; -1\Bigr)}
  {8\,\Gamma\Bigl(\frac74\Bigr)}.
  \]

One acceptable solution proceeds roughly as follows.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Write the orders in “half–integer form”. Notice that
  • J₂.₅(x)=J₅∕₂(x) and 
  • J₀.₅(2−x)=J₁∕₂(2−x).
Using the classical formulas
  \[
  J_{1/2}(z)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}}\sin z,\quad
  J_{3/2}(z)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}}\Bigl(\frac{\sin z}{z}-\cos z\Bigr),
  \]
one may show (by standard methods – for example using the formula
  \[
  J_{n+1/2}(z)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}}\Bigl[\Bigl(\frac{1}{z}\frac{d}{dz}\Bigr)^n\sin z\Bigr]
  \]
with n=2) that
  \[
  J_{5/2}(z)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}}
  \left[\Bigl(\frac{3}{z^2}-1\Bigr)\sin z-\frac{3\cos z}{z}\right].
  \]
Then the integrand may be written in “elementary‐function form”. (One must check that the factor x^(–2) is exactly canceled by the small–x behavior since J₅∕₂(x) ~ x^(5/2) as x→0.)
  
Step 2. By writing the two Bessel functions in “series‐form” and interchanging the order of summation and integration one may show that the answer can be written in closed–form in terms of hypergeometric functions. One acceptable answer was
  \[
  \int_{0}^{2}\frac{1}{x^2}J_{5/2}(x)J_{1/2}(2-x)\,dx
  =-\frac{\Gamma\Bigl(-\frac14\Bigr)\;_1F_2\Bigl(-\tfrac14; \tfrac14,\tfrac32; -1\Bigr)}
  {8\,\Gamma\Bigl(\frac54\Bigr)}
  +\frac{\Gamma\Bigl(\frac14\Bigr)\;_1F_2\Bigl(\tfrac14; \tfrac34,\tfrac54; -1\Bigr)}
  {8\,\Gamma\Bigl(\frac74\Bigr)}.
  \]
(There are several different – but equivalent – ways of writing the answer.) 
  
Step 3. A high–precision numerical evaluation shows that
  \[
  \int_{0}^{2}\frac{1}{x^2}J_{2.5}(x)J_{0.5}(2-x)\,dx\approx 0.0515700000\;.
  \]
