One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function. For example, one correct answer was

   
  I = (√π/(2^(9/2) Γ(11/2))) · [15 · _1F_2(5/2; 7/2, 11/2; –1) – 8 · _1F_2(3/2; 5/2, 7/2; –1)].

That is, one may show that

   
  ∫₀² (1/x²) J₂.₅(x) J₀.₅(2 – x) dx 
    = (√π/(2^(9/2) Γ(11/2))) · [15 · _1F_2(5/2; 7/2, 11/2; –1) – 8 · _1F_2(3/2; 5/2, 7/2; –1)].

One may prove this by writing the half‐integer Bessel functions in “elementary” form

  J₁/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) sin z        and
  J₅/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) [(3 sin z)/z² – (3 cos z)/z – sin z],
 
then writing the integrand as
  1/x² · J₅/₂(x) · J₁/₂(2 – x)
and then expanding in series and using the Beta–integral to sum term–by–term. (Any method which leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

A numerical evaluation of the answer gives

  I ≈ 0.0447900000   (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Note that there is more than one acceptable form for the “exact” answer.
