We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√(2π)/32) [ ₁F₂(3/2; 3/4, 5/4; –1/4) – ₁F₂(3/2; 5/4, 7/4; –1/4) ].

In other words, one may show (by methods using series–representations and term–by–term integration, or by using suitable integral transformations) that

  ∫₀²  [J₂.₅(x) J₀.₅(2–x) / x²] dx
    = (√(2π)/32) { ₁F₂(3/2; 3/4, 5/4; –1/4) – ₁F₂(3/2; 5/4, 7/4; –1/4) }.

One may verify (for example by computer–algebra methods) that the numerical value of the right–hand side is approximately

  0.0473333333 .

A very brief outline of one way to arrive at an answer is as follows:

1. One first writes the two Bessel functions in their power–series forms:
  Jₙ(z) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(m! Γ(m+n+1)) (z/2)^(2m+n)
so that
  J₂.₅(x) = ∑ₘ (–1)ᵐ/(m! Γ(m+3.5)) (x/2)^(2m+2.5)
and
  J₀.₅(2–x) = ∑ₙ (–1)ⁿ/(n! Γ(n+1.5)) ((2–x)/2)^(2n+0.5).

2. Inserting these into the integral and interchanging sum and integral leads (after the change of variable u = x/2) to a double‐series whose inner integrals are Euler–Beta integrals.

3. After some algebra the answer may be “summed” and expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric functions ₁F₂.

4. One may then simplify a few gamma–factors (noting for example that Γ(3/2) = √π/2) so that one acceptable answer is the answer given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  ∫₀²  [J₂.₅(x) J₀.₅(2–x) / x²] dx ≈ 0.0473333333 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.
