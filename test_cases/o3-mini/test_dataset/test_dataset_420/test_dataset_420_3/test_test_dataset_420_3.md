We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) min{ sin x, cot x } dx.

Step 1. Find the point where sin(x) = cot(x).

Since cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x), set
  sin x = cos x/sin x  ⟹  sin²x = cos x.
For x ∈ (0, π/2) we are allowed to divide by cos x (which is positive) by writing
  tan²x = 1,
so that
  tan x = 1  ⟹  x = π/4.

Step 2. Split the integral at x = π/4.

For 0 ≤ x < π/4, testing x = 30°:
  sin 30° = 0.5 and cot 30° = (cos 30°)/(sin 30°) ≈ (0.8660)/(0.5) ≈ 1.732;
hence min{sin x, cot x} = sin x.

For π/4 < x ≤ π/2, testing x = 60°:
  sin 60° ≈ 0.8660 and cot 60° = (cos 60°)/(sin 60°) = (0.5)/(0.8660) ≈ 0.5774;
so in this region min{sin x, cot x} = cot x.

Thus, we have

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) sin x dx + ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) cot x dx.

Step 3. Compute the first integral.

∫ sin x dx = –cos x + C.
So,
  ∫₀^(π/4) sin x dx = [–cos x]₀^(π/4)
            = [–cos(π/4) + cos(0)]
            = [–(√2/2) + 1]
            = 1 – (√2)/2.

Step 4. Compute the second integral.

Recall ∫ cot x dx = ∫ (cos x/sin x) dx = ln|sin x| + C.
Then,
  ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) cot x dx = [ln|sin x|]_(π/4)^(π/2)
            = ln(sin(π/2)) – ln(sin(π/4))
Since sin(π/2) = 1 and sin(π/4) = √2/2, we have
  = ln 1 – ln(√2/2)
  = 0 – ln(√2/2).

Notice that ln(√2/2) = ln(1/√2) = –(1/2) ln 2. Thus,
  ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) cot x dx = – ( –(1/2) ln 2 ) = (1/2) ln 2.

Step 5. Combine the results.

I = [1 – (√2)/2] + [(1/2) ln 2].

Thus, the exact answer is

  I = 1 – (√2)/2 + (1/2) ln 2.

Step 6. Numerical approximation.

First, compute:
  (√2)/2 ≈ 1.414213562373095/2 ≈ 0.7071067811865476,
  1 – (√2)/2 ≈ 1 – 0.7071067811865476 = 0.2928932188134524,
  (1/2) ln 2 ≈ 0.5 × 0.6931471805599453 = 0.34657359027997264.
Adding these gives:
  I ≈ 0.2928932188134524 + 0.34657359027997264 ≈ 0.6394668090934250.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, we have approximately 0.6394668091.
