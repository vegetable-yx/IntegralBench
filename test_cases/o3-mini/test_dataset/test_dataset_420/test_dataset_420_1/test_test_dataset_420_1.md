We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) min{ sin(x), cot(x) } dx.

First note that on (0, π/2) the functions behave as follows. For small x, sin(x) is near 0 while cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) is very large. Thus, for x near 0 the minimum is sin(x). For x near π/2, sin(x) is near 1 while cot(x) is near 0 so the minimum is cot(x). There is a unique point x₀ ∈ (0, π/2) where sin(x) and cot(x) are equal. To find x₀, we set

  sin(x₀) = cot(x₀) = cos(x₀)/sin(x₀).

Multiplying by sin(x₀) (which is positive on (0, π/2)) we obtain

  sin²(x₀) = cos(x₀).

Rearrange this as

  sin²(x₀) − cos(x₀) = 0     (1)

It is convenient to express the equality in terms of cos(x₀). Write sin²(x₀) = 1 − cos²(x₀), so (1) becomes

  1 − cos²(x₀) − cos(x₀) = 0  →  cos²(x₀) + cos(x₀) − 1 = 0.

Let t = cos(x₀). Then we have the quadratic

  t² + t − 1 = 0.

Its positive solution is

  t = (−1 + √5)/2.

Thus,

  cos(x₀) = (√5 − 1)/2.

Returning to (1), we observe that

  sin²(x₀) = cos(x₀) = (√5 − 1)/2  ⇒  sin(x₀) = √((√5 − 1)/2).

Now we can split the integral at x₀:
  I = ∫₀^(x₀) sin(x) dx + ∫_(x₀)^(π/2) cot(x) dx.

1. Calculate I₁ = ∫₀^(x₀) sin(x) dx:
  I₁ = [−cos(x)]₀^(x₀) = (−cos(x₀) + cos(0)) = 1 − cos(x₀)
    = 1 − (√5 − 1)/2.

2. Calculate I₂ = ∫_(x₀)^(π/2) cot(x) dx.
Recall that ∫ cot(x) dx = ln|sin(x)| + C. Hence,
  I₂ = [ln(sin(x))]_(x₀)^(π/2)
    = ln(sin(π/2)) − ln(sin(x₀)) = 0 − ln(sin(x₀)) = − ln(sin(x₀)).
Since sin(x₀) = √((√5 − 1)/2), we have
  I₂ = − ln(√((√5 − 1)/2)) = −½ ln((√5 − 1)/2).

Thus, the total integral is

  I = I₁ + I₂ = 1 − (√5 − 1)/2 − ½ ln((√5 − 1)/2).

This is the exact answer.

Now, for the numerical approximation:
• Compute (√5 − 1)/2:
  √5 ≈ 2.2360679775  ⇒  (2.2360679775 − 1)/2 ≈ 0.61803398875.
• Then 1 − 0.61803398875 = 0.38196601125.
• Next, ln(0.61803398875) ≈ −0.48121182506 and so
  ½ ln((√5 − 1)/2) ≈ −0.24060591253.
• Therefore, I ≈ 0.38196601125 − (−0.24060591253) = 0.38196601125 + 0.24060591253 ≈ 0.62257192378.

Rounding to 10 decimal places gives 0.6225719238.
