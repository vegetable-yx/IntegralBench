We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) (2 – x)^(–1/2) cosh(√(x(2 – x))) dx.

Step 1. Make a substitution that simplifies the square roots. Set

  x = 1 – cos θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π].

Notice that when x = 0, we have 0 = 1 – cos θ so cos θ = 1 and θ = 0, and when x = 2, we have 2 = 1 – cos θ so cos θ = –1 and θ = π.

Now compute the pieces:

• dx/dθ = sin θ  ⇒ dx = sin θ dθ.

• 2 – x = 2 – (1 – cos θ) = 1 + cos θ.

• x(2 – x) = (1 – cos θ)(1 + cos θ) = 1 – cos²θ = sin²θ,
  so that √(x(2 – x)) = sin θ  (since sin θ ≥ 0 for θ ∈ [0,π]).

• Also,
  x^(–1/2)(2 – x)^(–1/2) = 1/√[x(2 – x)] = 1/sin θ.

Step 2. Substitute everything into the integral:
  I = ∫₀^π [1/sin θ] cosh(sin θ) (sin θ dθ)
    = ∫₀^π cosh(sin θ) dθ.

Thus the original integral reduces to
  I = ∫₀^π cosh(sin θ) dθ.

Step 3. Write cosh(sin θ) in its power‐series form:
  cosh(sin θ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (sin θ)^(2n)/(2n)!,
and note that the integrals of even powers of sinθ on [0, π] are known:
  ∫₀^π (sin θ)^(2n) dθ = √π·Γ(n + ½)/Γ(n + 1).

Thus,
  I = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/(2n)! ∫₀^π sin^(2n)θ dθ
    = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/(2n)! (√π·Γ(n + ½)/Γ(n + 1)).

A standard result in series theory (using the duplication formula for the Gamma–function) shows that this series sums to
  I = π I₀(1),
where I₀(1) is the modified Bessel function of order zero with argument 1.

An alternative and well‐known formula is:
  ∫₀^π cosh(a sin θ) dθ = π I₀(a),
so choosing a = 1 yields our answer.

Step 4. Numerical evaluation:
 I = π I₀(1). The value of I₀(1) is approximately 1.2660658777520082, hence
 I ≈ π × 1.2660658777520082 ≈ 3.9768944137.

Thus, the final answer is given by
  Exact answer: π I₀(1)
  Numerical answer: 3.9768944137
