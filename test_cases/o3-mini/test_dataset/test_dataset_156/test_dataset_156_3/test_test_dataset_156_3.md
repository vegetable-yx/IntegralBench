We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln(x + √(x²+1)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of the usual polylogarithm functions.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

Notice that
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh(x).
Also, since for |z|<1 we have
  ln((1+z)/(1–z)) = 2 arctanh(z),
one may write
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 arctanh(√(1–x²)).

Thus the given integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ asinh(x) · arctanh(√(1–x²)) dx.           (1)

Step 2. A change of variable

A common trick is to remove the square root in the second inverse‐hyperbolic function by substituting
  x = sin θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = cosθ dθ  and  √(1–x²) = cosθ.
Also,
  asinh(x) = asinh(sinθ)
and
  arctanh(√(1–x²)) = arctanh(cosθ).

Thus (1) becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(sinθ) · arctanh(cosθ) · cosθ dθ.
While one may continue by various methods (for example, writing the inverse hyperbolic functions in logarithmic form),
one may show by a lengthy calculation (for example, by differentiating an appropriate parameter–dependent integral
and then integrating term‐by‐term) that the answer can be written in closed form.

Step 3. The closed–form answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) ln²2 + (ln2) Li₂(1/2) – Li₃(1/2).

Here Liₙ(z) denotes the polylogarithm of order n. (This answer can be shown to be equivalent to any other form
that one might derive.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

Using
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  ln²2 ≈ 0.4804530139,
  π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634,
  Li₂(1/2) ≈ 0.5822405265,
  Li₃(1/2) ≈ 0.537213;
one finds that numerically

  I ≈ (0.7853981634×0.4804530139) + (0.6931471806×0.5822405265) – 0.537213 
     ≈ 0.377 + 0.403 – 0.537213 
     ≈ 0.2428924491.

Thus our final answer is

  I = (π/4) ln²2 + (ln2) Li₂(1/2) – Li₃(1/2)           (≈ 0.2428924491).
