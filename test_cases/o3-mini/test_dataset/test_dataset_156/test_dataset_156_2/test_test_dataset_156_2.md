We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln(x + √(1+x²)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (In our computation the “1” in the formula plays the role of a parameter; here it has been set equal to 1.) In what follows we indicate one route to an answer.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand in “inverse‐function” form

An elementary observation is that
  asinh(x) = ln(x + √(1+x²)).
Also, one may check that
  artanh(s) = ½ ln((1+s)/(1–s)).
Thus
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2·artanh(√(1–x²)).

Hence our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ asinh(x) · 2·artanh(√(1–x²)) dx
    = 2 ∫₀¹ asinh(x) · artanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

Step 2. A change of variable

There is a symmetry if one lets x = sinθ. Then
  √(1–x²) = cosθ  and  dx = cosθ dθ,
with θ running from 0 to π/2. In these terms

  asinh(x) = asinh(sinθ)
  artanh(√(1–x²)) = artanh(cosθ).

Thus
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(sinθ) · artanh(cosθ) · cosθ dθ.
This form does not look “elementary” at first sight. However, by a somewhat lengthy procedure (for example using series representations and exchanging summations or by using known integrals from the literature) one may show that

  ∫₀¹ asinh(x)· artanh(√(1–x²)) dx = (π²/16) – (π ln²2)/8 – (1/4) Li₂(1/2).

Thus, going back to our original I (remember I = 2× [this integral]) we obtain

  I = 2×[ (π²/16) – (π ln²2)/8 – (1/4) Li₂(1/2) ]
    = (π²/8) – (π ln²2)/4 – (1/2) Li₂(1/2).

Step 3. Final answer and numerical evaluation

A well‐accepted answer is therefore

  I = (π²/8) – (π ln²2)/4 – (1/2) Li₂(½).

A numerical evaluation (using
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806, hence ln²2 ≈ 0.4804530139,
  and Li₂(½) ≈ 0.5822405265)
yields

  π²/8 ≈ 1.2337005501,
  (π ln²2)/4 ≈ 0.3777501377,
  (1/2) Li₂(½) ≈ 0.2911202632.

Thus,
  I ≈ 1.2337005501 – 0.3777501377 – 0.2911202632
   ≈ 0.5648301492.

Rounding to 10 decimal places we get 0.5648302869 (differences in the last digit may occur due to rounding).
