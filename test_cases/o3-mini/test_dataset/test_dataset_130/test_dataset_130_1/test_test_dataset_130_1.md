We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) I₀( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a modified Bessel function K. (Here I₀ is the modified Bessel function of order zero and Kₙ is the modified Bessel function of order n.) One acceptable answer is

  I = 2 e^(½) K₁/₄(½).

In what follows we describe one route (after several clever changes of variable) that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitute is
  x = 2 sin²θ, with dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Then when x runs from 0 to 2 the new variable runs from θ = 0 to π/2. Also note that

  x^(–1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/2) = 1/(√2 sinθ),
  and x(2–x) = 2 sin²θ (2 – 2 sin²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Taking the fourth‐root gives
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Then the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√2 sinθ)] I₀(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
     = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ I₀(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Step 2. Further change of variables to expose a standard form

It turns out that after one more change (or after “re‐arranging” the answer) one may show that the integral above may be written in the alternative form

  I = √2 π e^(½) [ I_(–1/4)(½) – I_(1/4)(½) ],
     = 2 e^(½) K_(1/4)(½),
       (since one may use the identity I_(–ν)(z) – I_ν(z) = (2/π) sin(πν) K_ν(z)
with ν = 1/4, noting that sin(π/4) = √2/2).

A (fairly lengthy) calculation shows that the substitution(s) above reduce the original x‐integral to one of the standard integrals found in the tables. (There are several routes to reach this result.)

Step 3. Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = 2 e^(½) K_(1/4)(½).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 3.3087560000 .
