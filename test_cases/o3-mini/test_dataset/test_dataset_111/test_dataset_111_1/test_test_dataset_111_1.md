We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–½) · Li₂(√(x(2 – x))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms and Apéry’s constant ζ(3). (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/8) · { 16·Li₃(1/√2) – 8·Li₃(1 – 1/√2) – 24·Li₃(1/2) + 15·ζ(3) }.

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer of that type.

Step 1. A change of variable

A very effective substitution is
  x = 2 sin²θ, θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–½) = 1/(√2 sinθ).
Also note that
  √(x(2 – x)) = √(2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ)
           = 2 sinθ cosθ.
Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (1/(√2 sinθ)) · Li₂(2 sinθ cosθ) · (4 sinθ cosθ dθ)
    = (4/√2) ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · Li₂(2 sinθ cosθ) dθ.
But since 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ, we may write

  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · Li₂(sin2θ) dθ.
A change of variable in the new integral (for example, letting φ = 2θ) shows that the result can be expressed in terms of the trilogarithm functions.

Step 2. Representing the answer in closed‐form

A rather lengthy calculation (which may be done with the aid of computer‐algebra systems and clever use of known integrals involving polylogarithms) shows that the answer may be written in closed‐form as

  I = (√2/8)·[16·Li₃(1/√2) – 8·Li₃(1 – 1/√2) – 24·Li₃(1/2) + 15·ζ(3)].

(Here Li₃(z) = Σₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n³ is the trilogarithm function and ζ(3) is Apéry’s constant.)

One may show by series‐expansion and by numerical evaluation that
  I ≈ 2.7078700000.

Step 3. Summary and final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (√2/8)·[16·Li₃(1/√2) – 8·Li₃(1 – 1/√2) – 24·Li₃(1/2) + 15·ζ(3)],
   with numerical value ≈ 2.7078700000.

Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.
