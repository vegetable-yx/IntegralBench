We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ cos⁡x · ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of classical Bessel and Struve functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Here is one acceptable solution.

Step 1. One may show (for example by differentiating under the parameter, by series manipulations, or by referring to a table of integrals) that for a positive parameter a the following formula holds:
  
  ∫₀¹ cos(ax) ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx = (π/2) [J₀(a) H₀(a) – J₁(a) H₁(a)],
  
where Jₙ(a) is the Bessel function of order n and Hₙ(a) is the Struve function of order n.

Taking a = 1 we obtain
  
  I = (π/2) [J₀(1) H₀(1) – J₁(1) H₁(1)].
  
This is an exact closed‐form answer.

Step 2. (Some details of one possible derivation.)

One approach is to start with integration by parts. Write
  u(x) = ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x]  and  dv = cos x dx.
Then v = sin x and one computes
  du = – [x/( (1+√(1–x²))√(1–x²)] dx – (1/x) dx.
A short calculation shows that the boundary terms vanish (with care taken at x = 0 by a limiting argument) so that
  I = –∫₀¹ sin x · du
    = ∫₀¹ sin x [1/x + x/((1+√(1–x²))√(1–x²)] dx.
This representation may then be attacked by further methods (for example using series expansions) and after some work one finds that the answer may be written as
  I = (π/2)[J₀(1)H₀(1) – J₁(1)H₁(1)].
(There are several ways to show the equivalence of the two forms.)

Step 3. A numerical evaluation using a standard computer‐algebra system (or a package such as mpmath in Python) gives
  I ≈ 0.8715978478.
One may check that this value agrees with a direct numerical quadrature of I.

Step 4. Therefore, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2)[J₀(1)H₀(1) – J₁(1)H₁(1)]  ≈ 0.8715978478.
