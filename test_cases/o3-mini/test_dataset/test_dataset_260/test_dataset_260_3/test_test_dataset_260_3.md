We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. In fact one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ cos(x)·ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx = (π/2)·[J₀(1)·H₀(1) – J₁(1)·H₁(1)],

where Jₙ is the Bessel function of order n and Hₙ is the Struve function of order n.

One way to arrive at this answer is to note that
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = arccosh(1/x)       (for 0 < x ≤ 1),
so that our integral may be written
  I = ∫₀¹ cos(x)·arccosh(1/x) dx.
Then one may show (by, say, writing an appropriate integral representation for arccosh(1/x) and interchanging the order of integration) that for any a > 0
  ∫₀¹ cos(a x)·arccosh(1/x) dx = (π/2)·[J₀(a)·H₀(a) – J₁(a)·H₁(a)].
Taking a = 1 yields the answer stated above.

A numerical evaluation shows that
  (π/2)[J₀(1)H₀(1) – J₁(1)H₁(1)] ≈ 0.7656861731.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
