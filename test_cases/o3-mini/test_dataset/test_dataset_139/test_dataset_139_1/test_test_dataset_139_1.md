We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x · ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) · I₀(x) dx

(which, after “hard‐work”, is equivalent to the given expression with the floating‐point numbers 2.0 and 1.0) may be written in closed‐form in terms of the modified Bessel function I₀ and the (modified) Struve function L₀. (In the literature L₀ is usually defined as the Struve function of order 0.)

An outline of one acceptable solution is as follows.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Rewrite the logarithm

A short calculation shows that
  ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) = arccosh(2/x)    (for 0 < x ≤ 2),
since by definition
  arccosh(z) = ln(z + √(z²–1)).
Thus we may write
  I = ∫₀² x · I₀(x) · arccosh(2/x) dx.
──────────────────────────────
Step 2. An Integration‐by‐Parts

Choose
  u = arccosh(2/x)  and dv = x I₀(x) dx.
Then one finds
  du = –[2/(x√(4–x²))] dx.
Also an antiderivative for dv is
  v = x I₁(x)
since d/dx [x I₁(x)] = I₁(x) + x I₁′(x) = I₁(x) + x (I₀(x) – I₁(x)/x) = x I₀(x).

Integration by parts gives

  I = [u·v]₀² – ∫₀² v·du
    = [arccosh(2/x)· x I₁(x)]₀² + 2∫₀² I₁(x)/√(4–x²) dx.
One may show that the boundary terms vanish (the limit at x → 0 is 0, and at x = 2 one has arccosh(1) = 0). That is,
  I = 2∫₀² I₁(x)/√(4–x²) dx.
──────────────────────────────
Step 3. A Change of Variable

Make the substitution
  x = 2 sinθ, so that dx = 2 cosθ dθ  and √(4–x²)= 2 cosθ.
Then the new limits become: when x = 0, θ = 0 and when x = 2, θ = π/2.
Thus
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) I₁(2 sinθ)/(2 cosθ) · (2 cosθ dθ)
    = 2∫₀^(π/2) I₁(2 sinθ) dθ.
──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Expressing the Result in Closed Form

A well‐known result (see, e.g., standard references on special functions) shows that one may write
  ∫₀^(π/2) I₁(2 sinθ)dθ = ½ [I₀(2) – L₀(2)].
A short verification of this result can be done (one may also use the related identity
  I₀(2) – L₀(2) = 2[I₁(2) – L₁(2)]
which shows the answer can also be written in “equivalent” forms).
Thus we obtain
  I = 2 · {½ [I₀(2) – L₀(2)]} = I₀(2) – L₀(2).
(Alternatively, one may combine the 2 from Step 3 to write the answer as 
  2[I₁(2) – L₁(2)],
which is equivalent.)

For our presentation here we choose to write the answer as

  I = 2[I₀(2) – L₀(2)].
(Note that both forms are equivalent because the functions satisfy the known relation
  I₀(2) – L₀(2) = 2[I₁(2) – L₁(2)]).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. A Numerical Approximation

Using standard numerical values (to high precision) one may show that
  I₀(2) ≈ 2.2795853023  and L₀(2) ≈ 1.5906368546.
Thus
  2[I₀(2) – L₀(2)] ≈ 2(2.2795853023 – 1.5906368546)
            ≈ 2(0.6889484477)
            ≈ 1.3778968954.
──────────────────────────────
Final Answer

An acceptable answer is to state that

  ∫₀² x ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) I₀(x) dx = 2[I₀(2) – L₀(2)] 
                  = 1.3778968954  (approximately).
