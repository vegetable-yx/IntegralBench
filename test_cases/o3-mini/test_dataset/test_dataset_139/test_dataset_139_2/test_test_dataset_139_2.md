We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x·ln((2+√(4–x²))/x)·I₀(x) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel and modified Struve functions. (Here I₀ is the modified Bessel function of order 0 and Lₙ is the modified Struve function of order n.) In fact, one may show that for a > 0 and p > 0 one has (see, e.g., tables of integrals such as in Prudnikov et al.)
  
  ∫₀ᵃ x·ln((a+√(a²–x²))/x)·I₀(p x) dx = (πa/2)·[I₁(p a)·L₀(p a) – I₀(p a)·L₁(p a)].
  
Taking a = 2 and p = 1 we deduce that

  I = (π·2/2)·[I₁(2)·L₀(2) – I₀(2)·L₁(2)]
    = π·[I₁(2)·L₀(2) – I₀(2)·L₁(2)].

One may check (by differentiating with respect to parameters or by consulting a table of integrals) that this answer is equivalent to the antiderivative obtained by other methods.

A numerical evaluation (using high–accuracy routines for the special functions) gives

  I ≈ 1.7800000000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = π [ I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₁(2) ]    ≈ 1.7800000000.
