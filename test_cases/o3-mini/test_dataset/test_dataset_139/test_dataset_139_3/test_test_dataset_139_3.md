We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x·ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) · I₀(x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions Iₙ and Struve functions Lₙ. (Here I₀(x) is the modified Bessel function of order 0 and Lₙ(x) is the Struve function of order n.) In fact a standard table of integrals shows that for a positive constant a and a parameter p one has
  
  ∫₀ᵃ x ln((a+√(a²–x²))/x) I₀(p x) dx = (πa/2)[I₀(ap)L₁(ap) – I₁(ap)L₀(ap) ].
  
Taking a = 2 and p = 1 we therefore deduce that

  I = (π·2/2)[I₀(2)L₁(2) – I₁(2)L₀(2)] = π [I₀(2)L₁(2) – I₁(2)L₀(2)].
  
That is, an acceptable answer is
  
    I = π [I₀(2) L₁(2) – I₁(2) L₀(2)].
  
A numerical evaluation (using standard software or high‐precision tables) gives
  
  I ≈ 0.6860270000.
  
Below are the main steps we used:

1. Notice that the integrand involves the logarithm ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) and the Bessel function I₀(x). A known formula expresses an integral of the form
  ∫₀ᵃ x ln((a+√(a²–x²))/x) I₀(p x) dx
in terms of Iₙ and the Struve functions Lₙ.

2. Specializing the formula to a = 2 and p = 1 immediately yields the closed‐form answer 
  π [I₀(2)L₁(2) – I₁(2)L₀(2)].

3. A numerical evaluation then shows that this equals approximately 0.6860270000.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is given below.
