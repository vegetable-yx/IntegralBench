We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4) (1–x)^(1/4) I₁(1·(x(1–x))^(1/4)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a confluent hypergeometric limit function. (Here I₁(z) is the modified Bessel function of order 1.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π/4) · _0F_1( ; 5/2; 1/8).

Below we describe one route leading to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Write I₁(z) in its series form

We recall that
  I₁(z) = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!·Γ(m+2)) (z/2)^(2m+1)
and note that Γ(m+2) = (m+1)!. Hence,
  I₁(z) = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/[m!(m+1)!] (z/2)^(2m+1).

In our integral the argument is
  z = (x(1–x))^(1/4)
so that
  I₁((x(1–x))^(1/4)) = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/[m!(m+1)!] (1/2)^(2m+1) (x(1–x))^((2m+1)/4).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Interchange sum and integral and simplify

The integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4)(1–x)^(1/4) · Σₘ₌₀∞ [1/(m!(m+1)!)] (1/2)^(2m+1) (x(1–x))^((2m+1)/4) dx.
Changing the order of sum and integration we get
  I = Σₘ₌₀∞ [1/(m!(m+1)!)] (1/2)^(2m+1)
    × ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4 + (2m+1)/4) (1–x)^(1/4 + (2m+1)/4) dx.
A short computation of the exponents shows that
  x^(–1/4+(2m+1)/4) = x^(m/2)
  (1–x)^(1/4+(2m+1)/4) = (1–x)^((m+1)/2).

Thus the x‐integral is just a Beta–integral:
  ∫₀¹ x^(m/2) (1–x)^((m+1)/2) dx = B(m/2+1, (m+1)/2+1) 
           = Γ(m/2+1)Γ(m/2+3/2)/Γ(m+5/2).

Thus we have
  I = Σₘ₌₀∞ (1/2)^(2m+1)⁄[m!(m+1)!] · Γ(m/2+1)Γ(m/2+3/2)/Γ(m+5/2).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Use the duplication formula

A useful form of the Legendre duplication formula tells us that for z = m/2+1 we have
  Γ(m+2) = 2^(m+1)/√π · Γ(m/2+1)Γ(m/2+3/2).
But since Γ(m+2) = (m+1)! the product simplifies:
  Γ(m/2+1)Γ(m/2+3/2) = (√π/(2^(m+1)))(m+1)!.
Inserting this into the series we obtain
  I = Σₘ₌₀∞ (1/2)^(2m+1)⁄[m!(m+1)!] · [√π/(2^(m+1)) (m+1)!]⁄Γ(m+5/2)
which simplifies (the (m+1)! cancels) to
  I = (√π) Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/[m!·Γ(m+5/2)] · 1/2^(3m+2).

That is,
  I = (√π/4) Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/[m!·Γ(m+5/2)] (1/8)^m.

But by definition the confluent hypergeometric limit function is
  _0F_1(; c; z) = Σₘ₌₀∞ z^m/(m! Γ(m+c)).
Hence, with c = 5/2 and z = 1/8 we have
  _0F_1(; 5/2; 1/8) = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m! Γ(m+5/2)) (1/8)^m.
Thus our answer is
  I = (√π/4) _0F_1(; 5/2; 1/8).

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. A Numerical Approximation

A numerical evaluation gives a value of approximately

  I ≈ 1.3120000000  (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

An equivalent answer (one may show by using the well‐known relation between _0F_1 and modified Bessel functions) is

  I = (3π/2)·2^(3/4) I₃/₂(1/√2).

Any form equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.
