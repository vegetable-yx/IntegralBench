We start with the integral:
  ∫₁¹⁰ (e^(ln x) + ln(e^x)) dx

Step 1: Simplify the integrand.
 • e^(ln x) = x   (since e^(ln x) returns x for x > 0)
 • ln(e^x) = x   (by the logarithm property ln(e^x) = x)
Thus, the integrand becomes:
  x + x = 2x

Step 2: Evaluate the integral:
  ∫₁¹⁰ (2x) dx = 2 ∫₁¹⁰ x dx

Step 3: Compute the antiderivative of x:
  ∫ x dx = (1/2) x²
Multiplying by 2:
  2 * (1/2) x² = x²

Step 4: Evaluate the antiderivative from 1 to 10:
  x² |₁¹⁰ = (10² − 1²) = (100 − 1) = 99

Thus, the exact answer of the integral is 99.

Step 5: Numerical approximation:
  The numerical approximation is also 99, which to 10 decimal places is 99.0000000000
