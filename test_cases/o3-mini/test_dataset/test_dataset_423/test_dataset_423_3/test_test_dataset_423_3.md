We start by simplifying the integrand:
  e^(ln x) = x  and  ln(e^x) = x.
Thus, the integrand becomes:
  x + x = 2x.

Now, the integral is:
  ∫₁¹⁰ (2x) dx.

Factor out the constant 2:
  2 ∫₁¹⁰ x dx.

Recall that:
  ∫ x dx = x²/2.
So,
  2 ∙ [x²/2] evaluated from 1 to 10 = [x²] evaluated from 1 to 10.

Evaluating the definite integral:
  = 10² - 1²
  = 100 - 1
  = 99.

Thus, the exact answer is 99. 

The numerical approximation (to 10 decimal places) is 99.0000000000.
