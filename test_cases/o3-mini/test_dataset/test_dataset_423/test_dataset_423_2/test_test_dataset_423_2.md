Step 1. Simplify the integrand.
• Note that e^(ln x) = x.
• Also, ln(e^x) = x.
Thus, the integrand becomes: e^(ln x) + ln(e^x) = x + x = 2x.

Step 2. Write the integral with the simplified integrand.
The integral becomes:
  ∫₁¹⁰ 2x dx

Step 3. Compute the integral analytically.
The antiderivative of 2x is:
  ∫2x dx = x² + C.
Evaluating from 1 to 10:
  [x²]₁¹⁰ = 10² − 1² = 100 − 1 = 99.

Step 4. Numerical approximation.
Since the exact answer is 99, the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:
  99.0000000000
