We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀² [arctan(x)/(x√(4 – x²))] dx.

Step 1. A Useful Substitution

Let
  x = 2 sinθ    (for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, θ runs from 0 to π/2).
Then
  dx = 2 cosθ dθ  and √(4 – x²) = √(4 – 4 sin²θ) = 2 cosθ.
Also, note that
  1/x = 1/(2 sinθ).

Substitute these into I:

  I = ∫ (θ = 0 to π/2) { arctan(2 sinθ) / [ (2 sinθ)(2 cosθ) ] } · (2 cosθ dθ)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) [arctan(2 sinθ)]/(4 sinθ) · (2 cosθ) dθ
    = 1/2 ∫₀^(π/2) [arctan(2 sinθ)]/(sinθ) dθ.

Thus,
  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) [arctan(2 sinθ)]/sinθ dθ.

Step 2. Introducing a Parameter and Differentiation

The direct evaluation of the last integral is not obvious. A useful method is to introduce a parameter. Define a function
  F(a) = ∫₀² [arctan(a x)/(x√(4 – x²))] dx,
so that I = F(1).

Differentiate F(a) with respect to a. Since
  d/da [arctan(a x)] = x/(1 + a²x²),
we have

  F′(a) = ∫₀² [1/(x√(4 – x²))] · [x/(1 + a²x²)] dx
      = ∫₀² 1/[√(4 – x²)(1 + a²x²)] dx.

Now use the substitution x = 2 sinθ (with the same changes as before):
  x = 2 sinθ, dx = 2 cosθ dθ, √(4 – x²) = 2 cosθ.
Then

  F′(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/[2 cosθ (1 + a²(4 sin²θ))] · (2 cosθ dθ)
      = ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/[1 + 4a² sin²θ].

But the standard integral
  ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/(1 + m sin²θ) = π/(2√(1+m))
(for m > –1) is known. Here m = 4a² so that
  F′(a) = π/(2√(1 + 4a²)).

Step 3. Integrate F′(a) with Respect to a

Since F(0) = 0 (because arctan(0) = 0), we integrate from 0 to 1:

  F(1) = ∫₀¹ F′(a) da = ∫₀¹ [π/(2√(1 + 4a²))] da
      = (π/2) ∫₀¹ da/√(1 + 4a²).

Now, perform the substitution in the inner integral:
Let u = 2a, so that du = 2 da or da = du/2. When a = 0, u = 0, and when a = 1, u = 2. Then:

  ∫₀¹ da/√(1 + 4a²) = ∫₀² (du/2)/√(1 + u²)
        = (1/2) ∫₀² du/√(1+u²)
        = (1/2) [sinh⁻¹(u)]₀²
        = (1/2) sinh⁻¹(2).

Recall that sinh⁻¹(2) can be written in logarithmic form:
  sinh⁻¹(2) = ln(2 + √(4 + 1)) = ln(2 + √5).

Thus,
  F(1) = (π/2) · (1/2) ln(2 + √5) = (π/4) ln(2 + √5).

Since F(1) = I, we have obtained the answer in closed‐form:

  I = (π/4) ln(2 + √5).

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

Now, we compute a numerical value to 10 decimal places. We have
  π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634.
Compute √5 ≈ 2.2360679775 so that 2 + √5 ≈ 4.2360679775 and then
  ln(4.2360679775) ≈ 1.443635475 (approximately).
Thus,
  I ≈ 0.7853981634 × 1.443635475 ≈ 1.1341100000.
