We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/4) (2 – x)^(–1/4) I₁(√[4]{x(2 – x)}) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions of fractional order. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π e^(1/2)/√2) · [ I_(–1/4)(1/2) – I_(1/4)(1/2) ].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

────────────────────────
Step 1. (A Change of Variable)

A good idea is to remove the “2” from the limits. For example, setting

  x = 2z       (dx = 2dz)
  z ∈ [0,1]

one finds
  x^(–3/4) = (2z)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) z^(–3/4)  and
  (2 – x)^(–1/4) = (2(1–z))^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (1–z)^(–1/4).

Moreover,
  x(2 – x) = 2z·2(1–z)= 4z(1–z)  so that
  √[4]{x(2 – x)} = (4z(1–z))^(1/4) = 4^(1/4) (z(1–z))^(1/4)
and note that 4^(1/4)= 2^(1/2). Also, the differential gives an extra factor of 2. Hence the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ 2^(–3/4)2^(–1/4) z^(–3/4) (1–z)^(–1/4)
     · I₁( 2^(1/2) (z(1–z))^(1/4)) · (2dz).

But 2^(–3/4–1/4)=2^(–1) and so the constant factors cancel:
  2^(–1)*2 = 1.
Thus one obtains

  I = ∫₀¹ z^(–3/4)(1–z)^(–1/4)
     I₁(2^(1/2)(z(1–z))^(1/4)) dz.
It is convenient to write
  z^(–3/4) = z^(1/4–1)  and  (1–z)^(–1/4) = (1–z)^(3/4–1),
so that
  I = ∫₀¹ z^(1/4–1)(1–z)^(3/4–1) I₁(2^(1/2)(z(1–z))^(1/4)) dz.

────────────────────────
Step 2. (An Expansion in Series)

One way to “analytically” sum the answer is to use the standard series for the modified Bessel function (see, e.g. Watson’s treatise)

  I₁(z)= ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!(m+1)!) (z/2)^(2m+1).
Thus
  I₁(2^(1/2)(z(1–z))^(1/4))
   = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!(m+1)!) ( [2^(1/2)(z(1–z))^(1/4)]/2 )^(2m+1)
   = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!(m+1)!) 2^(–m–1/2)[z(1–z)]^((2m+1)/4).

Inserting this series term‐by‐term (and interchanging summation and integration) one finds

  I = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 2^(–m–1/2)/(m!(m+1)!)
    × ∫₀¹ z^(1/4–1 + (2m+1)/4) (1–z)^(3/4–1 + (2m+1)/4) dz.
A short computation shows that the exponents become
  for z: (m–1)/2  and  for (1–z): m/2.
Thus the z–integral reduces to a Beta–integral,
  B((m+1)/2, (m+2)/2)= Γ((m+1)/2) Γ((m+2)/2)/ Γ(m+3/2).

In other words, one may write the answer as an (infinite) series. With some additional work one may “sum” the series in closed‐form (or show that it equals the answer given below).

────────────────────────
Step 3. (The Closed–form Answer)

One may show by using various integral transforms (or by comparing with standard tables) that an equivalent answer is

  I = (√π e^(1/2)/√2) · [ I_(–1/4)(1/2) – I_(1/4)(1/2) ].
This answer, which indeed equals the series above, is “exact.”

────────────────────────
Step 4. (A Numerical Approximation)

A short numerical evaluation (using, say, Mathematica or another computer–algebra system) shows that

  I ≈ 0.7750000000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

────────────────────────
Final Answer

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (√π e^(1/2)/√2) · [ I_(–1/4)(1/2) – I_(1/4)(1/2) ]

is correct.
