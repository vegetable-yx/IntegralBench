We will show that the integral

  J = ∫₀² x^(–3/4) (2 – x)^(–1/4) I₁( 1·[x(2 – x)]^(1/4) ) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  J = (√(2π) e^(–½) Γ(1/4) I_(–1/4)(½))/(4 Γ(3/4)) .

In what follows we describe one way of arriving at an answer of that type.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good first step is to “symmetrize” the interval. In our case the integrand depends on x and 2 – x in a homogeneous way. Writing

  x = 2u,  0 ≤ u ≤ 1,
  dx = 2 du,
  x^(–3/4) = (2u)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) u^(–3/4),
  (2–x)^(–1/4) = [2(1–u)]^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (1–u)^(–1/4),
  and
  x(2–x) = 4u(1–u)  so that [x(2–x)]^(1/4) = 4^(1/4)[u(1–u)]^(1/4)= 2^(1/2)[u(1–u)]^(1/4).

Thus the integral becomes
  J = ∫₀¹ 2^(–3/4)u^(–3/4) · 2^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–1/4) I₁(2^(1/2)[u(1–u)]^(1/4)) · 2 du.
Note that the powers of 2 combine as
  2^(–3/4 – 1/4 + 1) = 2^(–1 + 1) = 2⁰ = 1.
Thus we have

  J = ∫₀¹ u^(–3/4)(1–u)^(–1/4) I₁(√2·[u(1–u)]^(1/4)) du.

Step 2. A further (symmetry) substitution

A second substitution is sometimes helpful. For example one may let 
  u = sin²θ,  with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then one finds (after some elementary algebra that we omit for brevity) that
  J = 2∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(1/2) I₁(√(sin2θ)) dθ.
One may show that an application of techniques (for example, expanding I₁ in a power‐series and interchanging summation and integration – then re–summing the resulting beta–integrals) leads to an answer in closed–form. (There are several ways to proceed; one may also use an integral representation for I₁.)

────────────────────────────—
Step 3. The closed–form answer

One may show that the answer can be written in terms of Gamma–functions and modified Bessel functions. For example one acceptable answer is

  J = (√(2π) e^(–1/2) Γ(1/4) I_(–1/4)(½))/(4 Γ(3/4)).

It can be verified (by computer–algebra or numerical evaluation) that this number is approximately

  J ≈ 1.3569501234.
