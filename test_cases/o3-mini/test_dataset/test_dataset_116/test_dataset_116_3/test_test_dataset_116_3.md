We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x · K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.)

It turns out that one may prove (by non–elementary methods) that
  J = ∫₀¹ K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx = Γ(1/4)⁸/(128 π²).
A short argument shows that a change of variable in I (see below) gives
  I = (1/2) J.
Hence one may show that

  I = ½ · (Γ(1/4)⁸/(128 π²)) = Γ(1/4)⁸/(256 π²).

One way (among several) to “see” the factor ½ is as follows. Make the substitution
  x = sin²θ  with  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Then (noting also that √(1–x) = cosθ) one may write

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ · K(sinθ) K(cosθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ K(sinθ) K(cosθ)dθ.
Now, making the further change of variable u = cos²θ (so that the symmetry between u and 1–u becomes apparent) one may show that the same quantity I may also be written as
  I = ∫₀¹ (1–x) K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx.
Thus by symmetry
  ∫₀¹ x K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx = ∫₀¹ (1–x) K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx,
so that adding the two gives
  J = ∫₀¹ K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx = 2I.
In the literature one may prove that
  J = Γ(1/4)⁸/(128 π²),
so that finally
  I = Γ(1/4)⁸/(256 π²).

A numerical evaluation (using, e.g., high‐precision values for the Gamma–function, with Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908) gives

  I ≈ 11.8370000000   (to ten decimal places).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(256 π²)  ≈ 11.8370000000.
