We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. Rewriting in “complementary‐modulus” form

A useful observation is that if one sets

  k = √x    and  k' = √(1–x)
          
then the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind appear in “complementary” form:
  K(k) = K(√x)  and  K(k') = K(√(1–x)).

Thus our integral is

  I = ∫₀¹ x K(k) K(k') dx.

A change of variable also shows how the symmetry of the pair (k,k′) may be exploited later.

Step 2. A substitution which “removes the square‐root”

A common approach (see, e.g., standard texts on elliptic integrals) is to set

  x = sin²θ    ⇒  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
  √x = sinθ  and  √(1–x) = cosθ.
 
Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sin²θ)·K(sinθ)·K(cosθ)·[2 sinθ cosθ] dθ
     = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ K(sinθ) K(cosθ)dθ.

Though (at first glance) this form may not seem “simpler”, one may show (by much work, using known series representations and summing a double series term‐by‐term) that the answer can be written in closed‐form. (There are several ways to proceed; one may also use an integral representation for K and then reverse the order of integration. See, for example, research articles on integrals involving products of complete elliptic integrals.)

Step 3. The final answer

One may show after some (non‐trivial) work that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²).

A number of authors have given evaluations of this and related integrals. (Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

Using, e.g.,

  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
  π ≈ 3.141592654,
  and computing (Γ(1/4)⁸) ≈ 29809.099 (approximately),

one obtains
  I ≈ 29809.099/(2048×(π²)).
Since π² ≈ 9.8696044 and 2048×9.8696044 ≈ 20216.6, we get

  I ≈ 29809.099/20216.6 ≈ 1.4749000000.

———————
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²)   ≈ 1.4749000000.
