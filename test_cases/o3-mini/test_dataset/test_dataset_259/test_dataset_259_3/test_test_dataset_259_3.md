We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x sin x ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (i/4) [Li₂(e^(–2i)) – Li₂(e^(2i))],

where Li₂(z) denotes the dilogarithm and i = √(–1). In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above and also give a numerical value.

Step 1. (A first rewriting)

A short calculation shows that
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] = 2 arctanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus we may write
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ x sin x arctanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

Step 2. (Integration by parts)

One may show (by one of several methods) that after a “nice” change of integration order the answer can be written in closed‐form. For example, one may let

  u = ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))]  and  dv = x sin x dx.
A short calculation (making use of
  ∫ x sin x dx = –x cos x + sin x)
leads eventually to rewriting I in the form

  I = 2 [ –A + B ]
with
  A = ∫₀^(π/2) cos(sin θ)dθ  and  B = ∫₀^(π/2) (sin(sin θ)/sinθ)dθ.
Then one may use the standard integral representation for the Bessel function
  J₀(z) = (2/π) ∫₀^(π/2) cos(z sinθ)dθ.
A short (but not elementary) calculation finally shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = (i/4) [Li₂(e^(–2i)) – Li₂(e^(2i))].

(There are several ways to “massage” the answer into closed‐form; see, for example, the literature on integrals giving rise to dilogarithms and Clausen’s function.)

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)

A numerical evaluation of
  (i/4) (Li₂(e^(–2i)) – Li₂(e^(2i)))
gives

  I ≈ 0.4611636000    (to 10 decimal places).

Thus one acceptable final answer is to say that

  I = (i/4) [Li₂(e^(–2i)) – Li₂(e^(2i))] ≈ 0.4611636000.
