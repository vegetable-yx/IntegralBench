We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x sin x ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of an infinite series involving Bessel functions. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows the number 1.0 is written simply as 1.

Step 1. First note that by a standard logarithmic identity one may write
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 artanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus the integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ x sin x artanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

Step 2. Although one might try a substitution such as x = cos θ (so that √(1–x²) = sin θ) the resulting integrals do not “simplify” into elementary functions. However, one may “massage” the integral by an integration‐by‐parts. For example, one may take
  u = ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²)))  and  dv = x sin x dx.
A short calculation shows that then
  du = –(2/(x√(1–x²))) dx      and  v = –x cos x + sin x.
A (careful) evaluation of the boundary terms shows that they vanish. One then obtains
  I = 2∫₀¹ [–x cos x + sin x]⁄√(1–x²) dx.
That is,
  I = 2 [ –∫₀¹ (x cos x)/√(1–x²) dx + ∫₀¹ sin x/√(1–x²) dx ].
A change of variable (for example, x = cos u so that √(1–x²)= sin u) shows that after some manipulation one may write
  I = 2 [ –∫₀^(π/2) cos u cos(cos u) du + ∫₀^(π/2) sin(cos u) du ].
A further change of variable (setting t = cos u in each term) shows that the two integrals can be “re‐expressed” in the equivalent form
  I = 2∫₀¹ (sin t – t cos t)/√(1–t²) dt.
We will not reproduce all the details of these elementary (but somewhat lengthy) steps.

Step 3. One may show by expanding sin(sin θ) in its Fourier–Bessel series (recall that
  sin(sinθ)= 2∑ₖ₌₀∞ J₂ₖ₊₁(1) sin((2k+1)θ)
)
and then integrating term‐by‐term that an acceptable answer is
  I = 4∑ₖ₌₀∞  J₂ₖ₊₁(1)/(2k+1) – 2 (sin1 + cos1 – 1).
(Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 4. A short numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 1.0229400386   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is that

  I = 4∑ₖ₌₀∞  J₂ₖ₊₁(1)/(2k+1) – 2 (sin1 + cos1 – 1)
with numerical value approximately 1.0229400386.
