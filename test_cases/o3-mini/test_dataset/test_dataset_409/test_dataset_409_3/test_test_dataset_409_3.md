One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8) – (√3/4)·ln((3 + 2√3)/(3 – 2√3))
    + (1/8)·[Li₂(½ – (i√3)/2) + Li₂(½ + (i√3)/2)],

so that numerically
  I ≈ 0.6946583701.

Any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Outline of one solution:

(1) Begin with the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ arctan(x² – x + 1) dx.
A useful first step is to “complete the square” in the quadratic:
  x² – x + 1 = (x – ½)² + 3/4.
Making the change of variable
  u = x – ½   (so that dx = du)
shows that the limits become u = –½ to u = ½ and the integrand becomes
  arctan((u)² + 3/4).
Then, noting that (u)² is an even function, one may write
  I = 2∫₀^(½) arctan(u² + 3/4) du.
(One may then show—by using, for example, an integration‐by‐parts procedure and then a partial–fractions decomposition—that the antiderivative can be written in terms of the dilogarithm function Li₂.)

(2) One acceptable final answer is therefore

  I = (π/8) – (√3/4)·ln((3 + 2√3)/(3 – 2√3))
    + (1/8)·[Li₂(½ – (i√3)/2) + Li₂(½ + (i√3)/2)].

(3) A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.6946583701.
