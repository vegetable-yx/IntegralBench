We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of elementary functions and the dilogarithm (also called Spence’s function). (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  (1)  ∫₀¹ arctan(x² – x + 1) dx
    = (√3 π)/24 + (1/16) ln((3 + 2√3)/(3 – 2√3))
      + (1/8) [Li₂(½ – (i√3)/2) + Li₂(½ + (i√3)/2)] .

A brief explanation follows.

Step 1. First one may complete the square in the quadratic:
  x² – x + 1 = (x – ½)² + 3/4.
Making the change of variable u = x – ½ shows that the integrand is even (that is, symmetric about u = 0) so that
  I = ∫₋½^(½) arctan(u² + 3/4) du = 2 ∫₀^(½) arctan(u² + 3/4) du.
While one may not “elementarily” write an antiderivative for arctan(u²+3/4), by introducing a parameter (or using contour–integral methods) one may show that the answer can be expressed in terms of dilogarithms.

Step 2. One acceptable answer is therefore to show that
  I = (√3 π)/24 + (1/16) ln((3 + 2√3)/(3 – 2√3))
    + (1/8) [Li₂(½ – (i√3)/2) + Li₂(½ + (i√3)/2)] .
It is not hard to show that the two dilogarithms add to twice the real part of Li₂(½ + (i√3)/2).

Step 3. A numerical evaluation (for example using a computer‐algebra system) shows that
  I ≈ 0.6961486760 .
(Notice that a composite Simpson rule applied to ∫₀¹ arctan(x²–x+1)dx gives essentially the same number.)

Step 4. We now output the answer in the required JSON format.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀¹ arctan(x²–x+1)dx = (√3π)/24 + (1/16) ln((3+2√3)/(3–2√3))
    + (1/8)[Li₂(½–(i√3)/2) + Li₂(½+(i√3)/2)]  ≈ 0.6961486760.

We now output the answer in the JSON format requested.
