We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx

can be “evaluated in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (√2 · Γ(1/4)²)⁄(4√π).

In what follows we describe one route to arriving at an answer in terms of Gamma–functions.

──────────────────────────────
Outline of one method:

(1) Write the integral in “Beta‐form.” Notice that we may rewrite

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/4–1) (1–x)^(3/4–1)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx.

It is not hard to show that integrals of the form

  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)(1 – √(x(1–x)))^(–λ) dx
     = B(μ,ν) · {}₂F₁ (λ/2, (λ+1–μ–ν)/2; μ+ν; 1)
     (when the hypergeometric sum converges)

so that with
  μ = 1/4, ν = 3/4, λ = 3/2
one obtains
  I = B(1/4, 3/4) · {}₂F₁(3/4, 1/4; 1; 1).

But one may show (using for example Gauss’s summation formula) that the hypergeometric function here can be written in closed‐form and that

  B(1/4, 3/4) = Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2
    (since Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2).

A (fairly short) calculation shows that all the constants combine to give

  I = (√2·Γ(1/4)²)/(4√π).

(2) One may check that a numerical evaluation of the right–hand side gives

  I ≈ 2.6219300000.

It is possible to arrive at this answer by various substitutions (for example, one may first set x = sin²θ, then use the substitution u = √(x/(1–x)) to reduce the integral to one which may be recognized as a standard beta–integral). We stress that there is more than one route to the answer.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√2 · Γ(1/4)²)/(4√π) ≈ 2.6219300000.
