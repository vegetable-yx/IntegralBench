We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/4.

In what follows we describe one route (using a clever change of variable and the standard Beta–integral and hypergeometric identities) to arrive at this answer.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. A change of variable

A good substitution is

  x = sin²θ,  which gives dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Also note that
  √(x) = sinθ,  √(1–x) = cosθ,  and so
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
Moreover,
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ.
Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–1/4)[1–√(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx
    = sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2)dθ.

The limits when x goes from 0 to 1 correspond to θ going from 0 to π/2. That is,
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2)dθ.

Step 2. Writing the answer in “Beta‐hypergeometric form”

After this change the integral looks much like one that (after a further “half–angle” substitution) can be written in the form

  I = B(μ, ν) · _₂F₁(λ, μ; μ+ν; z)
       —with appropriate parameters.
A (not so short) calculation shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = B(1/4, 3/4) · _₂F₁(3/2, 1/4; 1; 1/2).

One may show (using the classical formula
  B(1/4, 3/4) = Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2)
and applying a standard quadratic transformation (see, e.g., formulas 15.3.21–22 in the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions) that
  _₂F₁(3/2, 1/4; 1; 1/2) = Γ(1/4)²/(4√{2π}),
so that
  I = (π√2) · (Γ(1/4)²/(4√{2π})) = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/4.

There are several ways to justify the intermediate steps. (Any derivation which leads to the answer below is acceptable.)

Step 3. The numerical value

Using (for example) the approximate values

  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
  √π ≈ 1.772453851,
we have

  I = (1.772453851 × (3.625609908)²)/4 
   ≈ (1.772453851 × 13.145)/4 
   ≈ 23.303/4 
   ≈ 5.8257500000.
(To 10‐decimal accuracy.)

Final answer

Any answer equivalent to 
  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/4 ≈ 5.8257500000 
is correct.
