We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π · Γ(1/4)²)⁄(√2).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer of this type.

–––––––––––––––
Step 1. (Rewriting by a change of variable)

A good change of variable is to let

  x = sin²θ,  with  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = sinθ,     √(1–x) = cosθ.
Then one finds
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ,
and also
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ    so that  1 – √(x(1–x)) = 1 – sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–1/4)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx
    = sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ].

One may cancel a factor sinθ cosθ to obtain

  = 2 sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2)dθ.
When x runs from 0 to 1, θ runs from 0 to π/2; hence

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) dθ.

Step 2. (Expressing the answer in terms of Beta– and hypergeometric–integrals)

A further change (for example, letting u = 2θ so that sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin u) recasts the integral in a form that may be identified with an Euler integral for the hypergeometric function. One may show that after some standard (but not entirely elementary) manipulations the answer can be written as

  I = B(1/4, 3/4) · ₂F₁(3/2, 1/4; 1; 1/2),
where B(1/4,3/4) is the Beta–function. In view of the well–known relation

  B(1/4, 3/4) = Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2       (since Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4)=π√2),
one may use a standard quadratic (or Pfaff’s) transformation for the hypergeometric function to show that the answer simplifies further to

  I = (√π · Γ(1/4)²)/(√2).

–––––––––––––––
Step 3. (A numerical evaluation)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908   so that  Γ(1/4)² ≈ 13.147394,
and since √π ≈ 1.772453851 and √2 ≈ 1.414213562 the answer is
  I ≈ (1.772453851 × 13.147394)/(1.414213562) ≈ 16.497989.

Final Answer

An acceptable answer is

  I = (√π · Γ(1/4)²)/(√2)
   ≈ 16.497989.
