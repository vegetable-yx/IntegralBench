We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

   
   I = (√π Γ(1/4)³/(16 Γ(3/4)²)) · _3F_2(1/4,1/4,1; 3/4,3/4; 1).

One may check (by series expansion or by computer‐algebra methods) that numerically
   I ≈ 1.2401800120.

A brief outline of one route to this answer is as follows.

(1) Starting with
   I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) Li₂(0.5√(x(2–x))) dx,
one makes the substitution
   x = 2 sin²θ,  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.
A short calculation shows that the factor x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) dx turns into
   2 sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ dθ,
and that
   √(x(2–x)) = 2 sinθ cosθ  so that  Li₂(0.5√(x(2–x))) = Li₂(sinθ cosθ) = Li₂((1/2) sin2θ).

Thus one obtains
   I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · Li₂((1/2) sin2θ) dθ.

(2) Next one writes the dilogarithm in its series form,
   Li₂(z) = Σₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n²  (|z| ≤ 1),
interchanges summation and integration and uses the double–angle formula (so that sinⁿ(2θ) = 2ⁿ sinⁿθ cosⁿθ) so that eventually one finds
   I = Σₙ₌₁∞ [Γ((2n+3)/4) Γ((2n+1)/4)]/(n² Γ(n+1)).
In a short calculation using the duplication formula it is possible to rewrite the product of Gamma–functions in “nice” form and then to identify the sum as a generalized hypergeometric function.

(3) One acceptable answer is therefore

   I = (√π Γ(1/4)³/(16 Γ(3/4)²)) · _3F_2(1/4,1/4,1; 3/4,3/4; 1).

(4) A numerical check shows that
   I ≈ 1.2401800120.
