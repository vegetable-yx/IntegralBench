We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form” as an infinite series. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = Σₙ₌₁∞ [Γ((2n+1)/4)·Γ((2n+3)/4)]⁄[n²·Γ(n+1)],

so that
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) Li₂(0.5√(x(2–x))) dx
    = Σₙ₌₁∞ (Γ((2n+1)/4)Γ((2n+3)/4))/(n² Γ(n+1)).

Below we now describe one route to this answer.

Outline of one derivation:

1. Change of variable (symmetrizing the x–integration):
  Let x = 1 + u so that when x runs from 0 to 2 we have u from –1 to 1.
  Then one checks that
   x(2–x) = (1+u)(1–u) = 1–u²,
  and the algebra shows that
   x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) dx
  becomes
   (1+u)^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4) du.
  The polylog argument becomes Li₂(0.5√(1–u²)).

2. Next one uses the substitution u = cosθ (with θ running from 0 to π) which turns the algebraic factors into elementary trigonometric functions. In fact one finds

  (1+cosθ) = 2 cos²(θ⁄2) and (1–cosθ) = 2 sin²(θ⁄2).

  After also changing the differential (du = – sinθ dθ) one finds that the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^π cos^(–1/2)(θ⁄2) sin^(–3/2)(θ⁄2) sinθ·Li₂(0.5 sinθ) dθ × (constant).

3. A further substitution (for example, t = θ/2 so that sinθ = 2 sin t cos t) shows that

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos^(1/2)(t) sin^(–1/2)(t) Li₂(sin t cos t) dt.

4. Now expand the dilogarithm in its power‐series (which converges for |z| < 1):
  Li₂(z) = Σₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n²  (for |z| < 1).

  Since 0 ≤ sin t cos t ≤ 1/2 for t in [0, π/2] the series converges uniformly and we may write

  I = 2 Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/n² ∫₀^(π/2) [cos^(1/2)(t) sin^(–1/2)(t)]·[sin t cos t]ⁿ dt.

5. The t–integral is then a standard beta–integral. In fact, one checks that

  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(n – 1/2)(t) cos^(n + 1/2)(t) dt = ½ B((2n+1)/4, (2n+3)/4).

6. Hence one obtains

  I = 2 Σₙ₌₁∞ (1/n²)[½ B((2n+1)/4, (2n+3)/4)]
     = Σₙ₌₁∞ [B((2n+1)/4, (2n+3)/4)]⁄[n²].

7. Finally, writing the beta–function in terms of Gamma functions,
  B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b),
  with a + b = (2n+1)/4 + (2n+3)/4 = n + 1, we obtain

  I = Σₙ₌₁∞ [Γ((2n+1)/4) Γ((2n+3)/4)]⁄[n² Γ(n+1)].

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
