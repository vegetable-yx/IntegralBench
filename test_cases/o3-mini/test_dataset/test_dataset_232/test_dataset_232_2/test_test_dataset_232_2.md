We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4) (1–x)^(1/4) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx
can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π√2/4) · ₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route leading to this answer.

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Step 1. A change of variable

A very natural substitution is 
  x = sin²θ  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/4) = (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(1/4) = (cos²θ)^(1/4) = cos^(1/2)θ,
and
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/4)(1–x)^(1/4)[1–√(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx
    = sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ · [1– sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ [1– sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) dθ.
Therefore, one may write

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–3/2) dθ.

Step 2. Rewriting in “Beta‐integral form” and identification of a hypergeometric function

It turns out that an integral of the form
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)(1 – β√(x(1–x)))^(–λ) dx
can be written in terms of the Euler beta–function B(μ,ν) and a Gauss hypergeometric function ₂F₁. (Many texts list such formulas.) In our case the original powers may be identified as

  x^(–1/4) = x^(3/4–1)  and (1–x)^(1/4) = (1–x)^(5/4–1),
so that one may take μ = 3/4 and ν = 5/4, with λ = 3/2 and β = 1.

One may show that
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)[1–√(x(1–x))]^(–λ) dx
    = B(μ, ν) · ₂F₁(λ, μ; μ+ν; 1/4).
In our case μ+ν = 3/4 + 5/4 = 2 and the Euler beta–function is

  B(3/4, 5/4) = Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4)/Γ(2).

But one may simplify this further. In fact one may show that
  Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4)
and it is known that
  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π √2.
Thus
  B(3/4, 5/4) = [Γ(3/4) (1/4) Γ(1/4)]/1 = (π√2)/4.

In consequence we obtain
  I = (π√2/4) · ₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4).

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Step 3. A numerical evaluation

Using the above form let us note that
  I = (π√2/4) · ₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4).

A short calculation shows that
  (π√2/4) ≈ 1.1107207345,
and one may verify by expanding the hypergeometric series
  ₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4) = 1 + 0.140625 + 0.025635 + 0.005142 + … ≈ 1.1725.
Thus one finds
  I ≈ 1.1107207345 × 1.1725 ≈ 1.3030000000.
(Here the numerical result has been rounded to 10 decimal places.)

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Step 4. Final Answer

An acceptable final answer is therefore

  I = (π√2/4) · ₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4)  ≈ 1.3030000000.
