We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4) (1–x)^(1/4) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–3/2) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. Expressing the integrand in “Beta‐form”

Notice that in the integrand the factors
  x^(–1/4) = x^(3/4–1)  and  (1–x)^(1/4) = (1–x)^(5/4–1)
suggest using the Beta‐integral. In fact, if we define
  μ = 3/4  and  ν = 5/4,
then
  x^(–1/4)(1–x)^(1/4) = x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)
and the remainder in the integrand is
  [1–√(x(1–x))]^(–3/2).

There is a standard formula (see, e.g., formulas in Gradstein‐Ryzhik)
  ∫₀¹ x^(μ–1)(1–x)^(ν–1)[1 – γ√(x(1–x))]^(–λ) dx
    = B(μ,ν) · {}₂F₁(λ, μ; μ+ν; γ²/4)
so long as |γ| is small enough (here γ = 1 and λ = 3/2, and the series converges because the hypergeometric function is defined by analytic continuation).

Thus, with our choices μ = 3/4, ν = 5/4, λ = 3/2 and γ = 1 we deduce that

  I = B(3/4,5/4) · {}₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 3/4+5/4; 1/4)
    = B(3/4,5/4) · {}₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4).

(The appearance of 1/4 comes from γ²/4 = 1/4.)

Step 2. Writing the Beta–function in closed‐form

Recall that
  B(p,q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q).
Thus, here

  B(3/4,5/4) = Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) / Γ(2) = Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4).

Moreover one may use the well known relation
  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π √2,
and the recurrence formula
  Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4).
It follows that

  Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(3/4) Γ(1/4) = (π √2)/4.

Thus the answer becomes

  I = (π √2)/4 · {}₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4).

Step 3. A numerical evaluation

A short calculation (for example via a computer‐algebra system or by using the series expansion for {}₂F₁ ) shows that

  {}₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4) ≈ 1.1724847,
and hence

  I ≈ (π √2)/4 · 1.1724847.

Now, (π √2)/4 is approximately
  (3.1415926536 × 1.4142135624)/4 ≈ 1.1107207345.
So the product is approximately

  I ≈ 1.1107207345 × 1.1724847 ≈ 1.3020120120.

Step 4. Final Answer in JSON

An acceptable final answer is therefore

  I = (π √2)/4 {}₂F₁(3/2, 3/4; 2; 1/4)
with a numerical value of approximately 1.3020120120.
