We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + (cos x)/3) dx.

A useful idea is to introduce a parameter into the logarithm. Define

  I(a) = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + a cos x) dx,

so that our given integral is I(1/3).

Step 1. Differentiate with respect to a.

Differentiate under the integral sign:
  I′(a) = d/da ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + a cos x) dx
      = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · [cos x/(1 + a cos x)] dx.
Because sec x = 1/cos x, we have
  sec x · cos x = 1.
Thus,
  I′(a) = ∫₀ᴨ 1/(1 + a cos x) dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the resulting integral.

It is a standard result that for |a| < 1,
  ∫₀ᴨ dx/(1 + a cos x) = π/√(1 – a²).

Thus,
  I′(a) = π/√(1 – a²).

Step 3. Integrate with respect to a.

Since
  I′(a) = π/√(1 – a²),
we integrate:
  I(a) = ∫ π/√(1 – a²) da = π · arcsin(a) + C.

Step 4. Determine the constant C.

Set a = 0:
  I(0) = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + 0·cos x) dx = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · 0 dx = 0.
Also, plugging a = 0 into our expression gives:
  I(0) = π · arcsin(0) + C = 0 + C.
Thus, C = 0.

Hence, the family of integrals is given by:
  I(a) = π · arcsin(a).

Returning to our original integral by setting a = 1/3 we obtain the exact answer:
  I = I(1/3) = π · arcsin(1/3).

Step 5. Numerical approximation.

We now need a 10‐digit approximation. Since
  arcsin(1/3) ≈ 0.3398369095   (radians),
we have
  I ≈ π · 0.3398369095 ≈ 3.1415926536 · 0.3398369095 ≈ 1.0670329590.

Thus, the final answers are:
