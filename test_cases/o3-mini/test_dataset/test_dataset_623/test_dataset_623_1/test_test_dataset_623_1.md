We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + (cos x)/3) dx.

Step 1. Introducing a Parameter and Differentiating Under the Integral Sign

Define a parameter‐dependent integral

  I(a) = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · ln(1 + a cos x) dx      (1)

so that our original integral corresponds to I(1/3).

Differentiate I(a) with respect to a. By differentiating under the integral sign we have

  I′(a) = ∫₀ᴨ sec x · [d/da ln(1 + a cos x)] dx.

Since

  d/da ln(1 + a cos x) = cos x/(1 + a cos x),

and noting that sec x = 1/cos x, the integrand becomes

  sec x · (cos x/(1 + a cos x)) = 1/(1 + a cos x).

Thus,
  I′(a) = ∫₀ᴨ 1/(1 + a cos x) dx.

A standard integral formula tells us that for |a| < 1,

  ∫₀ᴨ dx/(1 + a cos x) = π/√(1 − a²).

Therefore,
  I′(a) = π/√(1 − a²).

Step 2. Integrate I′(a) with respect to a

Integrate with respect to a to recover I(a):

  I(a) = ∫₀ᵃ π/√(1 − t²) dt    (the constant of integration is chosen so that I(0) = 0).

Recognize that ∫₀ᵃ dt/√(1 − t²) = arcsin(a). Hence,

  I(a) = π · arcsin(a).

Recalling that our original integral corresponds to a = 1/3, we find

  I = π · arcsin(1/3).

Step 3. Numerical Approximation

We now compute a numerical approximation. First, note that

  arcsin(1/3) ≈ 0.3398369095.

Thus,
  I ≈ π · 0.3398369095 ≈ 3.1415926536 × 0.3398369095 ≈ 1.0673990000

(rounded to 10 decimal places).
