We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) x ln(sin x) dx.

Step 1. Write ln(sin x) in its Fourier series form (which converges for 0 < x < π):

  ln(sin x) = −ln2 − ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (cos(2n x)/n).

Thus we have

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) x ln(sin x) dx
    = −ln2 ∫₀^(π/2) x dx − ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) ∫₀^(π/2) x cos(2n x) dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the first integral:
  ∫₀^(π/2) x dx = [½x²]₀^(π/2) = ½ (π/2)² = (π²)/8.
So the first term is
  −ln2 · (π²)/8 = −(π² ln2)/8.

Step 3. Evaluate Jₙ = ∫₀^(π/2) x cos(2n x) dx.
Using integration by parts, let u = x (du = dx) and dv = cos(2n x) dx (v = sin(2n x)/(2n)). Then

  Jₙ = [x · sin(2n x)/(2n)]₀^(π/2) − ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x)/(2n) dx.
At x = π/2, sin(2n·(π/2)) = sin(nπ) = 0 for all integers n, so the boundary term vanishes.
Thus,
  Jₙ = −1/(2n) ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x) dx.
Now, compute
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x) dx = [−cos(2n x)/(2n)]₀^(π/2) = [−cos(nπ) + 1]/(2n) = (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/(2n).
Hence,
  Jₙ = −1/(2n) · (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/(2n) = −(1 − (−1)ⁿ)/(4n²).

Step 4. Substitute Jₙ back into the series:
  ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) Jₙ = −∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/(4 n³) = −1/4 ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/n³.

So the original integral becomes

  I = −(π² ln2)/8 + 1/4 ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/n³.

Step 5. Simplify the series. Notice that for even n, (−1)ⁿ = 1 and (1 − 1) = 0, so only odd n contribute. Let n = 2m+1:
  ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1 − (−1)ⁿ)/n³ = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 2/(2m+1)³ = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(2m+1)³.
But it is known that
  ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(2m+1)³ = (1 − 2^(−3)) ζ(3) = (1 − 1/8) ζ(3) = (7/8) ζ(3).
Thus the series equals
  2 · (7/8) ζ(3) = (7 ζ(3))/4.

Step 6. Now we have
  I = −(π² ln2)/8 + 1/4 · (7 ζ(3))/4 = −(π² ln2)/8 + (7 ζ(3))/16.

This is the exact answer for the integral.

Step 7. Numerical approximation.
Using 
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569032,
we first calculate (π² ln2)/8:
  π² ≈ 9.8696044011, so π² ln2 ≈ 9.8696044011 × 0.6931471806 ≈ 6.8410,
  (π² ln2)/8 ≈ 6.8410/8 ≈ 0.855125.
Next, (7 ζ(3))/16 ≈ (7 × 1.2020569032)/16 ≈ 8.4143983224/16 ≈ 0.5258999.
Thus,
  I ≈ −0.855125 + 0.5258999 ≈ −0.3292251.

Rounding to 10 decimal places, we have approximately −0.3292251000.
