We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) x ln(sin x) dx.

Step 1. Expand ln(sin x) in a Fourier series. A standard expansion is

  ln(sin x) = – ln 2 – Σₙ₌₁^∞ (cos 2n x)/n    (0 < x < π).

Thus,
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) x ln(sin x) dx
    = – ln2 ∫₀^(π/2) x dx – Σₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) ∫₀^(π/2) x cos(2n x) dx.

Step 2. Compute the elementary integral

  A = ∫₀^(π/2) x dx = [x²/2]₀^(π/2) = (π/2)²/2 = π²/8.

So the first contribution is
  – ln2 · (π²/8).

Step 3. Evaluate for each n the integral

  Bₙ = ∫₀^(π/2) x cos(2n x) dx.

Use integration by parts with u = x (du = dx) and dv = cos(2n x) dx (v = sin(2n x)/(2n)):

  Bₙ = [x · sin(2n x)/(2n)]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) (sin(2n x)/(2n)) dx.

At x = π/2 the boundary term is
  (π/2)·sin(nπ)/(2n)   (since sin(2n·(π/2)) = sin(nπ)).
Because sin(nπ) = 0 for all integers n, the boundary term vanishes.

Then,
  Bₙ = – (1/(2n)) ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x) dx.

Now, ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x) dx can be computed:
  ∫ sin(2n x) dx = – cos(2n x)/(2n) + constant,
so that
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin(2n x) dx = [– cos(2n x)/(2n)]₀^(π/2)
    = [– cos(nπ) + 1]/(2n) = (1 – cos(nπ))/(2n).

Thus,
  Bₙ = – (1/(2n))·[(1 – cos(nπ))/(2n)] = – (1 – cos(nπ))/(4n²).

Step 4. Return to the series. We had

  I = – ln2 · (π²/8) – Σₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) Bₙ.

Substitute Bₙ:
  I = – ln2 · (π²/8) – Σₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) [ – (1 – cos(nπ))/(4n²) ]
    = – ln2 · (π²/8) + Σₙ₌₁^∞ (1 – cos(nπ))/(4 n³).

Notice cos(nπ) = (–1)ⁿ. Thus,
  I = – (π² ln2)/8 + (1/4) Σₙ₌₁^∞ [1 – (–1)ⁿ]/n³.

In the sum, note that [1 – (–1)ⁿ] equals 0 when n is even and equals 2 for odd n. Therefore, writing n = 2m+1 we have

  Σₙ₌₁^∞ [1 – (–1)ⁿ]/n³ = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 2/(2m+1)³ = 2 Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(2m+1)³.

A known formula for the sum over odd cubes is
  Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(2m+1)³ = (1 – 1/2³) ζ(3) = (7/8) ζ(3).

Thus, the series sum becomes
  2 · (7/8) ζ(3) = (7 ζ(3))/4.

Then,
  I = – (π² ln2)/8 + (1/4)·[(7 ζ(3))/4] = – (π² ln2)/8 + (7 ζ(3))/16.

Step 5. Hence, the exact answer is

  I = – (π²/8) ln2 + (7 ζ(3))/16.

Step 6. Now, let’s provide a numerical approximation. Using

  π² ≈ 9.869604401089358,
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471805599453,
  ζ(3) ≈ 1.202056903159594,

we compute the first term:
  (π²/8) ln2 ≈ (9.869604401089358/8) × 0.6931471805599453 ≈ 1.23370055013617 × 0.6931471805599453 ≈ 0.855136057982577.

For the second term:
  (7 ζ(3))/16 ≈ (7 × 1.202056903159594)/16 ≈ 8.414398322117158/16 ≈ 0.5258998951323224.

Thus,
  I ≈ –0.855136057982577 + 0.5258998951323224 ≈ –0.3292361628502546.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical answer is –0.3292361629.
