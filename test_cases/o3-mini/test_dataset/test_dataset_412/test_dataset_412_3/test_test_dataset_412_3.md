We begin by writing the integral

  I = ∫₁^(2e) ⌊ln(x)⌋ dx.

Since the floor function ⌊ln(x)⌋ is piecewise constant, we must determine the intervals over which ln(x) lies between successive integers.

1. For x in [1, e), ln(x) ∈ [0, 1), so ⌊ln(x)⌋ = 0.
2. For x in [e, e²), ln(x) ∈ [1, 2), so ⌊ln(x)⌋ = 1.

Because the upper limit 2e is less than e² (since e ≈ 2.71828, we have e² ≈ 7.38906 and 2e ≈ 5.43656), we split the integration as follows:

  I = ∫₁^e 0 dx + ∫ₑ^(2e) 1 dx.

Now, computing the integrals:

• ∫₁^e 0 dx = 0,
• ∫ₑ^(2e) 1 dx = [x]ₑ^(2e) = 2e – e = e.

Thus, the exact value of the integral is I = e.

For a numerical approximation, using e ≈ 2.7182818285 (rounded to 10 decimal places), we have

  I ≈ 2.7182818285.
