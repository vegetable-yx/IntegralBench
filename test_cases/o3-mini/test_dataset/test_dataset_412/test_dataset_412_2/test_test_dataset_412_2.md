To evaluate

  ∫₁^(2e) ⌊ln(x)⌋ dx

we first note that ⌊ln(x)⌋ takes constant integer values on intervals where ln(x) lies between consecutive integers. That is, for an integer n we have

  ⌊ln(x)⌋ = n  when  n ≤ ln(x) < n + 1  ⇔  eⁿ ≤ x < e^(n+1).

The integration range [1, 2e] fits into the following subintervals:

1. When n = 0:
  x ∈ [e⁰, e¹) = [1, e)
  Here ln(x) ∈ [0, 1) so ⌊ln(x)⌋ = 0.

2. When n = 1:
  x ∈ [e¹, e²) = [e, e²)
  However, our upper limit is 2e, and since 2e < e² (because e² ≈ 7.389 and 2e ≈ 5.436), for x ∈ [e, 2e] we have ln(x) ∈ [1, 1 + ln(2)) ⊂ [1, 2). Hence ⌊ln(x)⌋ = 1.

Thus, the integral splits as follows:
  ∫₁^(2e) ⌊ln(x)⌋ dx = ∫₁^(e) 0 dx + ∫ₑ^(2e) 1 dx.

The first integral is 0, and the second is computed as:
  ∫ₑ^(2e) 1 dx = (2e − e) = e.

Thus, the exact answer is e.

For the numerical approximation, we use e ≈ 2.7182818285 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
