We start with the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (arctan x + arccot x) / (x² + 1) dx.

Step 1: Simplify the integrand

For x > 0, the trigonometric identity
  arctan x + arccot x = π/2
holds. So the integrand simplifies to

  (π/2) / (x² + 1).

Step 2: Compute the simplified integral

Thus, we have
  I = (π/2) ∫₀¹ 1/(x² + 1) dx.

Recall that
  ∫ 1/(x² + 1) dx = arctan x + C.
Evaluating the definite integral from 0 to 1 gives

  ∫₀¹ 1/(x² + 1) dx = arctan(1) − arctan(0) = (π/4) − 0 = π/4.

Step 3: Multiply by (π/2)

Hence, the original integral evaluates to
  I = (π/2) × (π/4) = π²/8.

Step 4: Provide a numerical approximation

The numerical value of π²/8 is approximately 1.2337005501 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
