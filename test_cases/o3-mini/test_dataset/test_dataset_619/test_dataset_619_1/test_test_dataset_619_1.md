We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (arctan x + arccot x)/(1 + x²) dx.

Step 1. Recognize the identity:
  For x > 0, arctan x + arccot x = π/2.
Thus, the integrand simplifies to
  (π/2)/(1 + x²).

Step 2. Write the simplified integral:
  I = (π/2) ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + x²) dx.

Step 3. Compute the integral ∫₀¹ 1/(1+x²) dx. The antiderivative is arctan x, so
  ∫₀¹ 1/(1+x²) dx = arctan(1) - arctan(0) = (π/4) - 0 = π/4.

Step 4. Substitute back:
  I = (π/2) · (π/4) = π²/8.

Step 5. Numerical approximation:
  π²/8 ≈ (9.869604401089358)/8 ≈ 1.2337005501.

Thus, the final answer is as follows:
{"answer": "\\frac{\\pi^2}{8}", "numerical_answer": "1.2337005501"}
