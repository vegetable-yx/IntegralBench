We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (arctan x + arccot x)/(x² + 1) dx.

Recall that for x > 0, arctan x + arccot x = π/2. (At x = 0, arctan 0 = 0 and arccot 0 = π/2 so the equation still holds.) Thus, the integrand simplifies to

  (π/2)/(x² + 1).

Therefore,

  I = (π/2) ∫₀¹ 1/(x² + 1) dx.

The antiderivative of 1/(x² + 1) is arctan x, so evaluating from 0 to 1 we have

  ∫₀¹ 1/(x² + 1) dx = arctan 1 − arctan 0 = (π/4) − 0 = π/4.

Thus,

  I = (π/2) × (π/4) = π²/8.

For a numerical approximation, we compute

  π²/8 ≈ 9.869604401089358/8 ≈ 1.2337005501.

The final answer is provided below.
