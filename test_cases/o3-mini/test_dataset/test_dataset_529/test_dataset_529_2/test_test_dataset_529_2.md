We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) ⎣2023 sin x⎦ dx.

Step 1. Split the integral into two parts:
  I = ∫₀^(π) ⎣2023 sin x⎦ dx + ∫ₚ^(2π) ⎣2023 sin x⎦ dx.

Step 2. Make the substitution in the second integral. Let t = 2π – x, so that when x = π, t = π and when x = 2π, t = 0. Since dx = –dt, we have:
  ∫ₚ^(2π) ⎣2023 sin x⎦ dx = ∫_π^0 ⎣2023 sin(2π – t)⎦ (–dt) = ∫₀^(π) ⎣2023 sin(2π – t)⎦ dt.
But, sin(2π – t) = – sin t, hence the second integral becomes:
  ∫₀^(π) ⎣–2023 sin t⎦ dt.

Step 3. Combine the two integrals:
  I = ∫₀^(π) [ ⎣2023 sin x⎦ + ⎣–2023 sin x⎦ ] dx.

Step 4. Use the identity for any non-integer real number y:
  ⎣y⎦ + ⎣–y⎦ = –1.
For almost all x in (0, π), 2023 sin x is not an integer (the set of exceptions has measure zero and does not affect the value of the integral). Hence,
  ⎣2023 sin x⎦ + ⎣–2023 sin x⎦ = –1 for almost every x ∈ (0, π).

Step 5. The integral becomes:
  I = ∫₀^(π) (–1) dx = –π.

Step 6. Numerical approximation:
  –π ≈ –3.1415926536 (rounded to 10 decimal places).

Thus, the final answers are:
