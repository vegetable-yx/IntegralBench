We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) ⎣2023 sin(x)⎦ dx.

A useful idea is to split the domain into two halves and use the symmetry of the sine function.

Step 1. Split the integral

We write
  I = ∫₀^(π) ⎣2023 sin(x)⎦ dx + ∫_(π)^(2π) ⎣2023 sin(x)⎦ dx.

Make the substitution u = x – π on the second integral. Note that when x runs from π to 2π, u runs from 0 to π and
  sin(x) = sin(u + π) = – sin(u).
Thus, the second term becomes
  ∫_(π)^(2π) ⎣2023 sin(x)⎦ dx = ∫₀^(π) ⎣2023 (– sin(u))⎦ du = ∫₀^(π) ⎣–2023 sin(u)⎦ du.
So, we have
  I = ∫₀^(π) [⎣2023 sin(x)⎦ + ⎣–2023 sin(x)⎦] dx.

Step 2. Use the floor function property

For any real number z which is not an integer, the following identity holds:
  ⌊z⌋ + ⌊–z⌋ = –1.
Since 2023 sin(x) is an integer only for a set of x of measure zero (for instance, when sin(x) = 0 or sin(x) = ±1, which occur at isolated points), we have that for almost all x in (0, π),
  ⌊2023 sin(x)⌋ + ⌊–2023 sin(x)⌋ = –1.
Thus,
  I = ∫₀^(π) (–1) dx = –π.

Step 3. Conclude the result

Hence, the exact value of the integral is –π.

Step 4. Numerical approximation

Using the approximation π ≈ 3.1415926536, we have:
  –π ≈ –3.1415926536.

Thus, the final answer is in JSON format as requested.
