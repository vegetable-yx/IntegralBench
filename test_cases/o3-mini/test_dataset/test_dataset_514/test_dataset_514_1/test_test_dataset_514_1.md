We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/3) [1/(1 + tan²(x))] dx.

Recall the Pythagorean trigonometric identity:

  1 + tan²(x) = sec²(x).

Thus,

  I = ∫₀^(π/3) cos²(x) dx.

Express cos²(x) using the half-angle identity:

  cos²(x) = (1 + cos(2x)) / 2.

Now substitute this into the integral:

  I = ∫₀^(π/3) (1 + cos(2x))/(2) dx
   = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/3) (1 + cos(2x)) dx.

Integrate term by term:

  ∫ (1) dx = x,
  ∫ cos(2x) dx = (1/2) sin(2x).

Thus, the antiderivative is:

  (1/2) [ x + (1/2) sin(2x) ].

Evaluate from 0 to π/3:

  I = (1/2) { [ (π/3) + (1/2) sin(2π/3) ] - [ 0 + (1/2) sin(0) ] }
   = (1/2) [ (π/3) + (1/2) sin(2π/3) ].

Since sin(2π/3) = sin(π - π/3) = sin(π/3) = (√3)/2, we have:

  I = (1/2) [ (π/3) + (1/2) × ((√3)/2) ]
   = (1/2) [ (π/3) + (√3)/4 ]
   = (π/6) + (√3)/8.

Now we calculate a numerical approximation:
  π/6 ≈ 3.1415926536/6 ≈ 0.5235987756,
  (√3)/8 ≈ 1.7320508076/8 ≈ 0.21650635095.

Thus, I ≈ 0.5235987756 + 0.21650635095 ≈ 0.74010512655.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the result is 0.7401051265.
