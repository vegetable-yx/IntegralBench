We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/3) [1/(1 + tan²x)] dx.

Step 1. Recognize the Pythagorean identity:
  1 + tan²x = sec²x.
Thus, the integrand becomes
  1/(1 + tan²x) = 1/sec²x = cos²x.

Step 2. Write the integral with the new integrand:
  I = ∫₀^(π/3) cos²x dx.

Step 3. Use the double-angle formula for cosine:
  cos²x = ½(1 + cos2x).
Hence,
  I = ∫₀^(π/3) ½ (1 + cos2x) dx
    = ½ ∫₀^(π/3) (1 + cos2x) dx.

Step 4. Integrate term by term:
  ∫ (1) dx = x,
  ∫ cos2x dx = (sin2x)/2.
Thus:
  I = ½ [ x + (sin2x)/2 ] evaluated from 0 to π/3.

Step 5. Evaluate at the limits:
When x = π/3:
  x = π/3, sin2x = sin(2π/3) = √3/2.
When x = 0:
  x = 0, sin(0) = 0.
So,
  I = ½ [ (π/3 + (1/2)(√3/2)) - (0 + 0) ]
    = ½ [ π/3 + (√3/4) ]
    = (π/6) + (√3/8).

Step 6. Numerical approximation:
Calculate:
  π/6 ≈ 0.5235987756,
  √3/8 ≈ 0.2165063509.
Thus,
  I ≈ 0.5235987756 + 0.2165063509 = 0.7401051265.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical value is 0.7401051265.
