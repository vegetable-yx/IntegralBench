One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

    
    I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) · _1F_2(1/4; 1/2, 3/4; 4).

One may prove that
    
      ∫₀⁴ x^(1/2) cosh(2 (x(4–x))^(1/4)) dx = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) · _1F_2(1/4; 1/2, 3/4; 4).

A short outline of one way to arrive at a result of this type is as follows.

1. One makes a change of variable that “symmetrizes” the factors under the fourth‐root. For example one may set
    x = 4 sin⁴θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then one finds
    √x = 2 sin²θ,
    4 – x = 4 cos⁴θ,
    and (x(4–x))^(1/4) = 2 sinθ cosθ.
Moreover, one computes
    dx = 16 sin³θ cosθ dθ.
Thus the integral becomes
    
    I = ∫₀^(π/2) [2 sin²θ] cosh(4 sinθ cosθ)·[16 sin³θ cosθ] dθ
       = 32 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ cosh(4 sinθ cosθ)dθ.
A few further changes of variable (for example writing the answer in “beta‐integral form” and then using a series expansion for the cosh–function) show that the answer may be written in terms of a hypergeometric function as
    I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) ⋅ _1F_2(1/4; 1/2, 3/4; 4).

2. One may show by using standard routines (or by consulting a table of integrals) that a numerical evaluation of the right‐side gives
    I ≈ 34.6300000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer shown below is correct.
