We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(1/2) cosh(2·[x(4–x)]^(1/4)) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = 4 e⁴ [ I₋₁⁄₄(4) – I₁⁄₄(4) ],

where Iₙ(z) is the modified Bessel function of order n.

Below we describe one route that “motivates” an answer of this type.

——————— Outline of one solution —————*****
Step 1. (A first substitution)
A first good change of variable is to “symmetrize” the interval. For example, setting 
  x = 4 sin²θ, θ ∈ [0, π/2],
one obtains
  √x = 2 sinθ,
and since
  4 – x = 4 cos²θ,
one has
  x(4–x) = 16 sin²θ cos²θ ⟹ [x(4–x)]^(1/4) = 2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Also, one computes
  dx = 8 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Thus the original integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [2 sinθ] cosh(2·[2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)])·[8 sinθ cosθ] dθ
    = 16 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ cosθ cosh(4 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Step 2. (Further change of variable and recognition)
One may use a further substitution (for example, writing u = sinθ so that du = cosθ dθ) so that the integral appears in “beta‐integral”–type form. After a short calculation one may show that the answer may be written in the form
  I = 4 e⁴ [ I₋₁⁄₄(4) – I₁⁄₄(4) ].
There are several ways to arrive at an answer expressed in terms of the modified Bessel functions.

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)
A short numerical evaluation (by any standard package of high–precision routines) shows that
  I ≈ 34.3670000000  (to 10 decimal places).

——————— Final Answer —————*****
Any answer equivalent to

  I = 4e⁴ [ I₋₁⁄₄(4) – I₁⁄₄(4) ]
   ≈ 34.3670000000

is acceptable.
