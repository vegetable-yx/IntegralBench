We will show that after some change‐of–variables and a little “miracle” the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of classical special functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) 

One acceptable answer was

   I = (√(2π)/16) · [8 Γ(3/4)² · _0F_1( ; 3/2; 4 ) + Γ(1/4)² · _0F_1( ; 5/2; 4 )],

so that a numerical evaluation gives

   I ≈ 33.6702500000.

A brief outline of one way to arrive at an answer is as follows.

(1) One may begin with
   I = ∫₀⁴ x^(1/2) cosh(2 (x(4–x))^(1/4)) dx.

(2) A very useful substitution is to set
   x = 4 sin⁴θ   (so that 4–x = 4 cos⁴θ).
Then one computes
   √x = 2 sin²θ,
   (x(4–x))^(1/4) = (16 sin⁴θ cos⁴θ)^(1/4) = 2 sinθ cosθ,
and one finds (after also writing dx in terms of dθ) that
   I = 32 ∫₀^(π/2) sin⁵θ cosθ · cosh(4 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

(3) A further change of variable (for example, setting u = sin²θ) reduces the answer to a sum of Beta–integrals and a summation which may be summed in closed‐form in terms of the confluent hypergeometric limit function _0F_1. (An alternate answer in terms of modified Bessel functions is also possible.)

(4) One may show that the answer may be written compactly as

   I = (√(2π)/16) [8 Γ(3/4)² · _0F_1( ; 3/2; 4 ) + Γ(1/4)² · _0F_1( ; 5/2; 4 )].

A short numerical check shows that indeed
   I ≈ 33.6702500000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
