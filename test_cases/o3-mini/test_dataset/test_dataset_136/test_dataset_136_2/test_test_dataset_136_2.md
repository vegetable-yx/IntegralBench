We wish to compute

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2)·(2 – x)^(1/2)·[1 – 0.5·x(2 – x)]^(1/2) dx.

A good strategy is to use a substitution that “linearizes” the factors under the fractional powers. We choose

  x = 2 sin²θ.

Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
and when x = 0, sinθ = 0 ⇒ θ = 0, and when x = 2, sinθ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2.

Now compute each factor in the integrand in terms of θ:

1. x^(–1/2) becomes
  x^(–1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/2) = 1/(√2·sinθ).

2. (2 – x)^(1/2) becomes
  2 – x = 2 – 2 sin²θ = 2 cos²θ  ⇒ (2 – x)^(1/2) = √(2 cos²θ) = √2 cosθ.

Multiplying these two, we get

  x^(–1/2)(2 – x)^(1/2) = (1/(√2·sinθ))·(√2 cosθ) = cosθ/sinθ = cotθ.

3. Now, consider the remaining factor:
  1 – 0.5·x(2 – x).
Since
  x(2 – x) = (2 sin²θ)(2 cos²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
we have
  1 – 0.5·[4 sin²θ cos²θ] = 1 – 2 sin²θ cos²θ.
It is useful to note that
  sin²2θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ  ⇒ 2 sin²θ cos²θ = (1/2) sin²2θ.
Thus, the expression becomes
  1 – 0.5·x(2 – x) = 1 – (1/2) sin²2θ.
Taking the square root gives
  [1 – 0.5·x(2 – x)]^(1/2) = √[1 – (1/2) sin²2θ].

Now put all pieces together. In terms of θ, the integrand times dx becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) {cotθ · √[1 – (1/2) sin²2θ] · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]}.

Notice that
  cotθ · 4 sinθ cosθ = (cosθ/sinθ)·4 sinθ cosθ = 4 cos²θ.
Thus, the integral simplifies to

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) 4 cos²θ √[1 – (1/2) sin²2θ] dθ.

It is convenient to express cos²θ in terms of the double angle:
  cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.
Thus

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) 4·[(1 + cos2θ)/2] √[1 – (1/2) sin²2θ] dθ
    = ∫₀^(π/2) 2 (1 + cos2θ) √[1 – (1/2) sin²2θ] dθ.

Next, make the substitution

  u = 2θ  ⇒ dθ = du/2.
When θ goes from 0 to π/2, u runs from 0 to π. Also, cos2θ = cos u and sin2θ = sin u. The integral then becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π) 2 (1 + cos u) √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] · (du/2)
    = ∫₀^(π) (1 + cos u) √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du.

Now split the integral into two parts:

  I = ∫₀^(π) √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du + ∫₀^(π) cos u √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du.

Notice that the second integrand is an odd function about u = π/2 (since cos u changes sign while sin²u remains the same). Thus, its integral over [0, π] vanishes:

  ∫₀^(π) cos u √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du = 0.

So,

  I = ∫₀^(π) √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du.

Because the integrand is symmetric about u = π/2, we may write

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) √[1 – (1/2) sin² u] du.

This last integral is recognized as the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Recall that by definition

  E(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – m sin²θ) dθ.
Here, m = 1/2. Hence,

  I = 2 E(1/2).

Thus, the exact answer is

  I = 2E(½).

For the numerical approximation, standard values give

  E(1/2) ≈ 1.467462209339426,
so that

  I ≈ 2 × 1.467462209339426 ≈ 2.934924418678852.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical answer is 2.9349244187.
