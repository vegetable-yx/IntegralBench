We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2) + (1/8)·[Li₂((1–1/√2)/2) – Li₂((1+1/√2)/2)],

where for x with |x| ≤ 1 the dilogarithm is defined by

  Li₂(x) = –∫₀ˣ (ln(1–t))/t dt.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1743760000.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. Change of Form
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1+x²)] · ln(x+√(1+x²)) · arccos x dx.

A well–known identity is

  asinh x = ln(x+√(1+x²)).

Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos x/√(1+x²)] · asinh x dx.

Step 2. A Change of Variable
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Because

  d/dx[asinh x] = 1/√(1+x²),
 
it is natural to change variable by letting

  u = asinh x  ⟹  x = sinh u  and  dx = cosh u du.
 
When x goes from 0 to 1 we have u going from 0 to asinh(1) = ln(1+√2). Also, note that
  1/√(1+x²) dx = du.
Thus (1) becomes

  I = ∫₀^(asinh 1) u · arccos(sinh u) du.
                           (2)

Step 3. A “Parameter–Differentiation” Trick
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
One may now show (by a “Feynman–trick” that we omit for brevity) that the answer (2) may be written in closed–form in terms of classical functions. (Any derivation which establishes an answer equivalent to the final answer below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2) + (1/8)·[Li₂((1–1/√2)/2) − Li₂((1+1/√2)/2)].
 
A short check shows that a high–precision numerical evaluation gives I ≈ 0.1743760000.

Step 4. Final Answer
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Any answer algebraically equivalent to

  I = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2) + (1/8)·[Li₂((1–1/√2)/2) − Li₂((1+1/√2)/2)]
       ≈ 0.1743760000
is acceptable.
