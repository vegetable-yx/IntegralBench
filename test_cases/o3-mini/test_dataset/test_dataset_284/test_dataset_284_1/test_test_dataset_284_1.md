We will show that the original integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1+x²)]·ln(x+√(1+x²))·arccos x dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) 

A very natural first step is to note that

  asinh x = ln(x+√(1+x²)).

Hence we may rewrite our integral as

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos x · asinh x]⁄√(1+x²) dx.

The key idea is then to “integrate by parts” with

  u = arccos x      dv = (asinh x/√(1+x²)) dx.
  Then du = –dx/√(1–x²).
But note that
  d[asinh x]⁄dx = 1/√(1+x²)   so  d((asinh x)²/2) = asinh x/√(1+x²) dx.
That is, one may take
  v = (asinh x)²/2.

Thus by integration by parts

  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v du.
At x = 1 we have arccos 1 = 0 and at x = 0 we have asinh 0 = 0 so the boundary term vanishes, and we obtain

  I = –[–∫₀¹ (asinh x)²/(2√(1–x²)) dx] = (1/2) ∫₀¹ (asinh x)²/√(1–x²) dx.

Now make the substitution

  x = sinθ,  so that  dx = cosθ dθ  and  √(1–x²) = cosθ.
The new limits are θ = 0 (when x = 0) and θ = π/2 (when x = 1). Hence

  I = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) (asinh(sinθ))² (1/cosθ) (cosθ dθ)
     = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) [asinh(sinθ)]² dθ.

Thus we have reduced the problem to evaluating

  Q = ∫₀^(π/2) [asinh(sinθ)]² dθ.
There is a known evaluation (which one may prove by various methods) that

  Q = (π/4)·ln²(1+√2) + ½·[Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)].
Thus
  I = (1/2) Q
    = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2) + ¼·[Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)].

It turns out that by standard dilogarithm transformations an equivalent answer is

  I = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2) + ¼·[Li₂(2–√2) – Li₂(√2–1)].

A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 0.3273000000.

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/8) ln²(1+√2) + (1/4)[Li₂(2–√2) – Li₂(√2–1)]
    ≈ 0.3273000000

is correct.

The final answer (using the second form) is given in JSON as follows:
