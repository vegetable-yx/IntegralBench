We will show that after a (fairly lengthy) chain of substitutions and some integration‐by‐parts the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1+x²)·ln(x+√(1+x²))·arccos x dx
    = (1/8)[ (4 – π)·ln²(1+√2) + 8·Li₂(2–√2) – 8·Li₂(√2–1) ] .
                                       (1)

To explain briefly one acceptable derivation is as follows. First one notes that

  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).

Then with the change of variable
  u = asinh(x)   so that  x = sinh u  and  dx = cosh u du,
one also has √(1+x²) = cosh u and the limits become u = 0 (when x = 0) and u = asinh(1) = ln(1+√2) (when x = 1). In this way one may show that

  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) u·arccos(sinh u) du.

A further (fairly delicate) treatment – for example by an integration‐by‐parts in u followed by some change of integration order – leads eventually to an answer in terms of classical polylogarithms. One acceptable answer is (1) above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.3138283837 .

Any answer equivalent to (1) (with the numerical value given to 10‐digit accuracy) is correct.

In the answer below the final answer is given in LaTeX and its numerical approximation is provided.
