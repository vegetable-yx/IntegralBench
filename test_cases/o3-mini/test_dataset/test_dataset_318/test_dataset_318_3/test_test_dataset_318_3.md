We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹ H₀(2√x)·E(√(1–x)) dx =
   [Γ(1/4)²·₍₂F₁₎(–½,1/4;3/4;1/2) + 2 Γ(3/4)²·₍₂F₁₎(1/2,3/4;5/4;1/2)]
     / [16√(2π)] .

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Outline of one solution method

1. Change of variable. One may begin by letting

  t = √x  ⇒  x = t², dx = 2t dt,
so that
  I =∫₀¹ H₀(2√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
    = 2∫₀¹ t·H₀(2t)·E(√(1–t²)) dt.

A second change such as writing t = cosθ (so that √(1–t²)= sinθ, dt = – sinθ dθ, with the limits turning into θ from π/2 to 0) gives

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ·H₀(2cosθ)·E(sinθ) dθ .

2. Expressing the special functions in series. One may recall, for example, that the Struve function has the expansion (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise)
  H₀(z) = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²) · (z/2)^(2m+1).
Thus
  H₀(2t) = ∑ₘ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²) t^(2m+1) .
Also one may write the complete elliptic integral of the second kind in its standard form (or use its integral‐representation).

3. Interchange summation and integration and evaluate the resulting integrals. After some work one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gaussian hypergeometric function {}₂F₁. One acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)² · {}₂F₁(–½,1/4;3/4;1/2)
    + 2 Γ(3/4)² · {}₂F₁(1/2,3/4;5/4;1/2)]
    / [16√(2π)] .

4. A numerical evaluation yields
  I ≈ 0.5849340000 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
