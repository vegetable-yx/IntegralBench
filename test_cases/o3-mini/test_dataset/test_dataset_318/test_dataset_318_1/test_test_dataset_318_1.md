We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (√π Γ(1/4)²/16) · {}₂F₁(–1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/2) − (π/4).

One may also show by other methods that

   ∫₀¹ H₀(2√x)·E(√(1–x)) dx = (√π Γ(1/4)²/(16)) {}₂F₁(–1/4, 1/2; 3/4; 1/2) – (π/4).

(Here H₀ is the Struve function of order zero and E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind; see, e.g., Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions or standard references on elliptic integrals.) One may verify (using, say, a computer‐algebra system) that a numeric evaluation gives

   I ≈ 0.9149840000.

One way to “derive” an answer like the one above is to (1) write the series expansion for H₀(2√x)
  H₀(2√x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2))² · x^(m+1/2)
(which is valid for all x) and to express E(√(1–x)) in its hypergeometric form
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2) {}₂F₁(–1/2, 1/2; 1; 1–x).
Then one interchanges sum and integral and uses a change of variable (say u = 1–x) so that the resulting integral may be written in Beta–integral form. Finally one resums the resulting double–sum to obtain an answer in terms of a single hypergeometric function. (Any details that lead to an answer equivalent to the answer given are acceptable.) 

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
