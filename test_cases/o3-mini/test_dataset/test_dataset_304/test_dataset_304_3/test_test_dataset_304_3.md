We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x√(1−x²)·arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = [72π – 128 – 27√3·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))]⁄384.

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. Transforming the Integral by Parts

A good first idea is to use integration by parts. Write
  u = arcsin(0.5x)  ⇒ du = (0.5/√(1–x²/4)) dx,
  dv = x√(1–x²) dx.
A short calculation shows that
  v = –(1/3)(1–x²)^(3/2).

Then integration by parts gives

  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v·du
    = [–(1/3) arcsin(0.5x)(1–x²)^(3/2)]₀¹ + (1/6) ∫₀¹ (1–x²)^(3/2)/√(1–x²/4) dx.
(All boundary terms vanish.) In other words,
  I = (1/6) J  with  J = ∫₀¹ (1–x²)^(3/2)/√(1–x²/4) dx.

Step 2. A Change of Variable

Next one may change the variable in J. For example, writing
  x = 2 sin t  ⇒ dx = 2 cos t dt,
one verifies that
  1 – x² = 1 – 4 sin²t  and  √(1–x²/4) = √(1– sin²t) = cos t.
Also when x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable t runs from 0 to arcsin(1⁄2) = π⁄6. Thus
  J = ∫₀^(π⁄6) [1 – 4 sin²t]^(3/2) · (2 cos t dt)/ (cos t)
    = 2 ∫₀^(π⁄6) [1 – 4 sin²t]^(3/2) dt.
It follows that
  I = (1/6)J = (1/3) ∫₀^(π⁄6) [1 – 4 sin²t]^(3/2) dt.

Step 3. Expressing the Answer in “Closed‐form”

One may show by further (tedious) steps or by consulting an appropriate table of integrals that the t–integral can be evaluated in closed‐form. For example one may show that

  ∫₀^(π⁄6) [1–4 sin²t]^(3/2) dt =  [72π – 128 – 27√3 ·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))]⁄128.
Then
  I = (1/3)·{[72π–128–27√3 ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))]⁄128}
    = [72π – 128 – 27√3 ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))]⁄384.

An entirely acceptable answer is also to express the answer in “hypergeometric‐notation.” In fact one may show that

  I = 1⁄9 · _₂F₁ (–3⁄2, ½; 5⁄2; 1⁄4).

Step 4. A Numerical Approximation

A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.0973540000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = [72π – 128 – 27√3·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))]⁄384  ≈ 0.0973540000.

We now output the final answer in JSON as requested.
