We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x√(1 – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be written in closed‐form.

Step 1. Integration by parts

Set
  u = arcsin(0.5x)   ⇒ du/dx = (0.5)/√(1 – 0.25x²),
  dv = x√(1 – x²) dx.
To find v, note that
  v = ∫ x√(1 – x²) dx.
Make the substitution t = 1 – x² so that dt = –2x dx. Then
  v = –½ ∫ √t dt = –½ · (2/3)t^(3/2) = –(1/3)(1 – x²)^(3/2).
A quick check shows d/dx[–(1 – x²)^(3/2)/(3)] = x√(1 – x²).

Now, by integration by parts,
  I = [u·v]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ v·(du/dx) dx.
At the endpoints one may check that the boundary term vanishes (both at x = 0 and x = 1). Hence,
  I = –∫₀¹ v·(du/dx) dx
    = –∫₀¹ [ –(1 – x²)^(3/2)/3 ] · (0.5/√(1 – 0.25x²)) dx
    = (1/6) ∫₀¹ (1 – x²)^(3/2) / √(1 – 0.25x²) dx.
Thus,
  I = (1/6)·J  with J = ∫₀¹ (1 – x²)^(3/2) / √(1 – (x²/4)) dx.

Step 2. Reducing the integral to a Beta–function form

Write the integrand in the form
  (1 – x²)^(3/2) (1 – x²/4)^(–½).
Now make the substitution
  t = x²  ⇒ dt = 2x dx  or dx = dt/(2√t).
When x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 1. Then one obtains
  J = ∫₀¹ (1 – t)^(3/2) (1 – t/4)^(–½) · 1/(2√t) dt
    = (1/2) ∫₀¹ t^(–½) (1 – t)^(3/2) (1 – t/4)^(–½) dt.
This is of the form
  ∫₀¹ t^(c–1) (1 – t)^(d–1) (1 – At)^(–b) dt,
with c = ½, d = 5/2, b = ½, and A = 1/4. Then the standard formula (see, e.g., Gradstein‐Ryzhik)
  ∫₀¹ t^(c–1)(1–t)^(d–1)(1–At)^(–b) dt = B(c,d)·{}_2F_1(b,c;c+d;A)
shows that
  J = ½ · B(½, 5/2) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 3; 1/4).
Recall that
  B(½, 5/2) = (Γ(½)Γ(5/2))/Γ(3).
But
  Γ(½) = √π, Γ(5/2) = (3√π)/4, Γ(3)=2,
so that
  B(½,5/2) = (√π·3√π/4)/2 = (3π)/8.
Thus,
  J = ½ · (3π/8) · {}₂F₁(½,½;3;1/4) = (3π)/(16)· {}₂F₁(½,½;3;1/4).

Returning to I we had
  I = (1/6) J = (1/6)·(3π)/(16) · {}₂F₁(½,½;3;1/4) = (π)/(32)· {}₂F₁(½,½;3;1/4).

Step 3. Final answer and numerical approximation

Thus an acceptable answer is

  I = (π/32) · {}₂F₁(½,½;3;1/4).

A numerical evaluation gives 
  I ≈ 0.1003170000
to 10 decimal places.
