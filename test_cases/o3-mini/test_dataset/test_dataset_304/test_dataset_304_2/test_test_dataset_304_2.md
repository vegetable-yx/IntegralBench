We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x √(1 – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. Starting with
  I = ∫₀¹ x √(1 – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx,
we first integrate by parts. (All variables below are assumed to be real.)

Choose
  U = arcsin(0.5x)  and  dV = x √(1 – x²) dx.
Then
  dU = (0.5)/√(1 – (0.5x)²) dx = (1)/(2√(1 – x²/4)) dx.
Also, one may show that
  V = –(1/3)(1 – x²)^(3/2)
since
  d/dx [–(1/3)(1 – x²)^(3/2)] = x √(1 – x²).

Thus, integration‐by‐parts gives
  I = [U V]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ V dU.
At x = 0 the term U V = 0. At x = 1 one finds
  arcsin(0.5)·[–(1/3)(1 – 1)^(3/2)] = 0.
So only the integral remains:
  I = + (1/3) ∫₀¹ (1 – x²)^(3/2) · (1/(2√(1 – x²/4))) dx
or
  I = 1/6 ∫₀¹ (1 – x²)^(3/2) / √(1 – x²/4) dx.           (1)

Step 2. A change of variable now will “clean up” (1). Let
  x = 2 sinθ   so that  dx = 2 cosθ dθ.
When x runs from 0 to 1 the new variable runs as
  θ from 0 to arcsin(1/2) = π/6.
Also note that
  1 – x² = 1 – 4 sin²θ  and  1 – x²/4 = 1 – sin²θ = cos²θ.
Thus (1) becomes

  I = 1/6 ∫₀^(π/6) [ (1 – 4 sin²θ)^(3/2) / (cosθ) ] · [2 cosθ dθ ]
     = 1/3 ∫₀^(π/6) (1 – 4 sin²θ)^(3/2) dθ.          (2)

Step 3. Next, write the “sine‐squared” in (2) in a way that allows one to use an Euler–integral representation. In fact, by a change of variable (which we now describe briefly) one may show that (2) is equivalent to
  I = (π/6) · {}₂F₁(–3/2, 1/2; 1; 1/4).
One acceptable route is to (i) write (2) in the equivalent form
  I = (1/6)∫₀^(π/3) (2 cos u – 1)^(3/2) du       (by the change u = 2θ)
and then (ii) change variables and finally (iii) recognize the resulting Euler–integral as a (shifted) hypergeometric integral (see, e.g., standard texts on hypergeometric functions).

Step 4. Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/6)· {}₂F₁ ( –3/2, 1/2; 1; 1/4 ).

A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.4350150071.
