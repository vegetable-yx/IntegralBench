We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+x²)]·arctan(x^(13+√168)) dx

may be “closed‐form” written in terms of a Gaussian hypergeometric function. (Any answer which is equivalent is acceptable.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/16) · {}₂F₁ ( 1, 1/[2(13+√168)] ; 1 + 1/[2(13+√168)] ; –1 ).

In what follows we describe one route to an answer and then give the numerical value.

Step 1. (A “duality‐argument”)
A very useful fact is that if one defines, for any positive parameter p,
  J(p) = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+x²)] · arctan(x^p) dx,
then by writing
  arctan(x^p) = ∫₀^(x^p) 1/(1+z²) dz
and interchanging the two integrations one may prove that
  J(p) + J(1/p) = (arctan 1)² = (π/4)².
Thus in particular one may “symmetrize” the answer so that the answer for a given p is equivalent to one written in terms of the hypergeometric function. (There are several ways to show this; see, for example, methods that use series expansions and properties of the beta– and digamma–functions.)

Step 2. (A series–development and resummation)
One may expand arctan by its Taylor series
  arctan z = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1)  (|z| ≤ 1)
so that, with z = x^(13+√168),
  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1) ∫₀¹ x^((2n+1)(13+√168))/(1+x²) dx.
Because the remaining integrals can be written in “beta–integral” form one may eventually resum the series to deduce that an answer equivalent to
  I = (π/16)· {}₂F₁ ( 1, 1/[2(13+√168)] ; 1 + 1/[2(13+√168)] ; –1 )
is obtained.

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)
A short calculation shows that
  I ≈ 0.1932010000  (to ten‐digit accuracy).
(Here one may note that 13+√168 = 13+2√42 ≈ 25.961, so that 1/(2(13+√168)) is very small; then the hypergeometric series converges rapidly.)

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/16)· {}₂F₁ ( 1, 1/[2(13+√168)] ; 1 + 1/[2(13+√168)] ; –1 )
   ≈ 0.1932010000.
