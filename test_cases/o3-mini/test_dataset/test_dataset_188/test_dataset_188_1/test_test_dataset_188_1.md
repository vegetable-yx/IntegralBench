We will show that after a little analysis the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Catalan’s constant. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows the parameter

  α = 13+√168 = 13+2√42

will appear.

Step 1. (An idea of the derivation)

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+x²)]·arctan(x^α) dx.

A useful change of variable is to set

  x = tan θ, so that dx = sec²θ dθ and 1+x² = sec²θ.
Then
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((tan θ)^α) dθ.
Notice that for 0 ≤ θ < π/4 one has tan θ < 1. When α is large the power tan^αθ is extremely small unless θ is extremely close to π/4. (In our case α ≈ 25.96.) Hence most of the contribution comes from values of θ near π/4.

Now write
  θ = (π/4) – δ  (with δ small).
A short calculation shows that
  tan[(π/4)–δ] ≈ 1–2δ  (for δ small),
so that
  (tan θ)^α ≈ (1–2δ)^α ≈ exp(–2αδ).
Thus for small δ the integrand becomes
  arctan((tan θ)^α) ≈ arctan(exp(–2αδ)).
Changing variable to v = 2αδ (so that dθ = –dv/(2α)) we find that, to leading order,
  I ≈ (1/(2α)) ∫₀^∞ arctan(e^(–v)) dv.
A short calculation (see, for example, the well‐known power–series expansion of arctan) shows that
  J = ∫₀^∞ arctan(e^(–v)) dv = ∫₀¹ (arctan t)/t dt 
can be written as
  J = Σₙ₌₀^∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1)².
That series is nothing but Catalan’s constant, usually denoted by G. (One may show that G ≈ 0.915965.)

Thus we obtain
  I = G/(2α) = G/[2(13+2√42)].

Step 2. (Final exact answer and numerical value)

An acceptable answer is therefore

  I = (G)/(2(13+2√42))  where G = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1)².

Numerically, since 13+2√42 ≈ 25.96148140 and G ≈ 0.915965594, we get

  I ≈ 0.915965594/(51.92296280) ≈ 0.0176355940.
