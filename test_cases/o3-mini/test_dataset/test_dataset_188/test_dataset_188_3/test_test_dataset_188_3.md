We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π²/16) + [1/(8(13+√168))] · ln{ [Γ(1+1/[2(13+√168)])·Γ(1–1/[2(13+√168)])] / [Γ(½+1/[2(13+√168)])·Γ(½–1/[2(13+√168)])] } .

In other words, if

  I = ∫₀¹  [1/(1+x²)] · arctan(x^(13+√168)) dx

then one may show (by a somewhat lengthy process – see below for one route – and by interchanging integration order and making a tangent–substitution) that

  I = (π²)/16 + (1/[8(13+√168)])·ln ( (Γ(1+1/(2(13+√168)))·Γ(1–1/(2(13+√168))) )/(Γ(½+1/(2(13+√168)))·Γ(½–1/(2(13+√168))) ) ).

A sketch of one method is as follows:

1. Change the variable by writing x = tanθ so that dx/(1+x²) = dθ and the limits become θ = 0 and θ = π/4. Then
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan[(tanθ)^(13+√168)] dθ.

2. One may then “symmetrize” the interval by writing a companion integral in which the roles of tan^(13+√168)θ and its reciprocal are exchanged. (In fact, one may show that
  arctan(t^a) + arctan(t^(–a)) = π/2
for any positive t and a, so that if one calls the companion integral J then I+J = (π/2)(π/4) = π²/8.)

3. Finally, using standard techniques (for example, writing the answer in “parameter‐integral form” and then “integrating the parameter derivative”) one may show that I reduces to the answer given above. (There are several possible ways to proceed; the answer above is completely acceptable.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.6113300000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
