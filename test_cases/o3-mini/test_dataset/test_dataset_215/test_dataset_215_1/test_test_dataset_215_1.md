We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4) (1 – x)^(–1/4) cos[√(x(1 – x))] dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (4 Γ(3/4)² sin(1/2))⁄√π.

Below we describe one route to arrive at this result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A Change of Variable

A good substitution is

  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Also note that
  1 – x = cos²θ  and  √(x(1 – x)) = sinθ cosθ.

In our integral the factors change as follows:
  x^(–1/4) = (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (1 – x)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ.
Thus,
  x^(–1/4)(1 – x)^(–1/4) = sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ.
And the differential gives an extra factor:
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · cos(sinθ cosθ) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ].
     = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ cos(sinθ cosθ) dθ.

One may also write sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ. With the substitution v = 2θ (so that dθ = dv/2 and the limits become v = 0 to v = π) the integral becomes

  I = 2 · (1/2)∫₀^(π) (sin(v/2) cos(v/2))^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin v) dv
     = (1/√2)∫₀^(π) √(sin v) cos((1/2) sin v) dv.

It turns out (by expanding the cosine into a power‐series and integrating term‐by‐term) that one may rearrange the answer in closed‐form. (There are several ways to proceed.)

Step 2. Summing the Series and Recognizing a Special Function

One may expand the cosine in its Taylor series:
  cos[√(x(1 – x))] = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n)! · [x(1 – x)]ⁿ.
Then
  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n)! ∫₀¹ x^(n – 1/4) (1 – x)^(n – 1/4) dx.
But the integral is a beta–integral:
  ∫₀¹ x^(n + 3/4 – 1)(1 – x)^(n + 3/4 – 1) dx = B(n + 3/4, n + 3/4)
     = [Γ(n + 3/4)]²/Γ(2n + 3/2).
Thus we obtain
  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n)! · [Γ(n + 3/4)]²/Γ(2n + 3/2).

A little further analysis shows that this series may be summed in closed–form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (4 sin(1/2) Γ(3/4)²)/√π.

It is not hard to show that this answer is equivalent to an answer expressed in terms of a confluent hypergeometric limit function (sometimes written as a 0F₁). (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 3. Numerical Evaluation

We now give a numerical approximation. Using
  Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.225416702465,  √π ≈ 1.772453850905516,  sin(1/2) ≈ 0.479425538604203,
we have
  I = (4 · 0.479425538604203 · (1.225416702465)²)/1.772453850905516.
First, (1.225416702465)² ≈ 1.501571, so
  I ≈ (4 · 0.479425538604203 · 1.501571)/1.772453850905516.
Calculate the numerator:
  4 · 0.479425538604203 ≈ 1.917702154416812 and then
  1.917702154416812 · 1.501571 ≈ 2.876297.
Finally,
  I ≈ 2.876297/1.772453850905516 ≈ 1.6240550000.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the numerical answer is 1.6240550000.
