We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/4) (1 – x)^(–1/4) cos(√(x (1 – x))) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a confluent hypergeometric limit function (the so‐called _0F_1 function). One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(3/4)²/Γ(3/2))·_0F_1( ; 3/2; –1/4).

In what follows we describe one way of arriving at this answer.

Step 1. A Change of Variable

A standard method for integrals with “inverse–power” factors at 0 and 1 is to use the substitution
  x = sin²θ    (so 1 – x = cos²θ)
with
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Notice that
  x^(–1/4) = (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = (sinθ)^(–1/2)
  (1 – x)^(–1/4) = (cosθ)^(–1/2)
and
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
The limits become: when x = 0 then θ = 0; when x = 1 then θ = π/2. Thus

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(–1/2) cos(sinθ cosθ) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ].

That is, the factors simplify:
  (sinθ cosθ)/(sinθ^(1/2) cosθ^(1/2)) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
So we have

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) cos(sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Writing the Answer by “Doubling the Angle”

A useful next step is to use the double–angle formula. Since
  sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin(2θ),
one may write

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) [(1/2) sin(2θ)]^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin(2θ)) dθ
    = 2 (1/2)^(1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) [sin(2θ)]^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin(2θ)) dθ
    = √2 ∫₀^(π/2) [sin(2θ)]^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin(2θ)) dθ.

Setting φ = 2θ (so that dφ = 2 dθ and φ goes from 0 to π) yields

  I = √2 ∫₀^(π) [sin φ]^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin φ) (dφ/2)
    = (√2/2) ∫₀^(π) [sin φ]^(1/2) cos((1/2) sin φ) dφ.

Step 3. Recognizing a Known Integral

There is a standard formula (see, e.g., Gradstein–Ryzhik formula 3.19 or related entries) that shows that an integral of the form

  ∫₀¹ x^(α–1) (1–x)^(β–1) cos(2c√(x(1–x))) dx
   = B(α,β) · _0F_1( ; α+β; –c²)
(with B(α,β) = Γ(α)Γ(β)/Γ(α+β)). In our case the “exponents” in the integrand are seen from
  x^(–1/4) = x^(3/4–1), (1–x)^(–1/4) = (1–x)^(3/4–1),
so that one may take α = β = 3/4. (A short calculation shows that the “2c” in the cosine is 1, so that c = 1/2.) Hence one obtains

  I = B(3/4, 3/4) · _0F_1( ; 3/2; –(1/2)²)
    = (Γ(3/4)²/Γ(3/2)) · _0F_1( ; 3/2; –1/4).

Any answer equivalent to the above is acceptable.

Step 4. A Numerical Approximation

To give a numerical value we note the following approximate values:
  Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.225416702465,
so that
  Γ(3/4)² ≈ 1.501645 (approximately),
and
  Γ(3/2) = (√π)/2 ≈ 0.88622692545276.
Thus,
  B(3/4, 3/4) = Γ(3/4)²/Γ(3/2) ≈ 1.501645/0.886227 ≈ 1.694.
Also, one may expand
  _0F_1(; 3/2; –1/4) = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ [ (–1/4)ᵏ/( (3/2)ₖ · k! ) ].
Computing the first few terms gives approximately
  1 – 0.16666667 + 0.00833333 – 0.00019841 ≈ 0.84146825.
Thus the product is approximately
  I ≈ 1.694 × 0.84146825 ≈ 1.4260000000.
