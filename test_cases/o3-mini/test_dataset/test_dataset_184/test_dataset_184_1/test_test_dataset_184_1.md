We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀∞ [arctan x]⁄[x(x²+4)] dx.

A strategy that works well for integrals with an arctan factor is to use its integral representation. Recall that

  arctan x = ∫₀¹ [x⁄(1+x²t²)] dt   for x ≥ 0.

Using this representation we can write

  I = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(x²+4))] arctan x dx
    = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(x²+4))] [∫₀¹ x⁄(1+x²t²) dt] dx
    = ∫₀¹ [∫₀∞ 1/((x²+4)(1+x²t²)) dx] dt.

Thus, if we define

  J(t) = ∫₀∞ dx/[(x²+4)(1+t²x²)],
     then I = ∫₀¹ J(t) dt.

Step 1. Compute J(t)

We wish to evaluate

  J(t) = ∫₀∞ dx/[(x²+4)(1+t²x²)].

To perform this integration we first write the integrand in partial fractions with respect to x². Write

  1/[(x²+4)(1+t²x²)] = A/(x²+4) + B/(1+t²x²).

Multiplying through by (x²+4)(1+t²x²) gives

  1 = A(1+t²x²) + B(x²+4).

Equate coefficients for powers of x²:

• Constant term:   A + 4B = 1.
• Coefficient of x²:  A t² + B = 0  →  B = –A t².

Substitute B into the constant term:
  A – 4A t² = 1  →  A(1 – 4t²) = 1  →  A = 1/(1 – 4t²),
and therefore
  B = – t²/(1 – 4t²).

Now, we use the standard integrals
  ∫₀∞ dx/(x²+4) = π/(2·2) = π/4,
and
  ∫₀∞ dx/(1+t²x²) = π/(2(1/t)) = π/(2t).

Thus, we have
  J(t) = A·(π/4) + B·(π/(2t))
    = [π/(4(1–4t²))] – [t²π/(2t(1–4t²))]
    = [π/(4(1–4t²))] – [π t/(2(1–4t²))]
    = π(1 – 2t)⁄[4(1–4t²)].

Step 2. Compute I by integrating J(t) over t from 0 to 1

We now have 
  I = ∫₀¹ J(t) dt = π/4 ∫₀¹ (1–2t)/(1–4t²) dt.

Notice that the denominator factors as
  1 – 4t² = (1–2t)(1+2t).

Thus, for t ≠ 1/2, we can cancel the factor (1–2t):
  (1–2t)/(1–4t²) = 1/(1+2t).

So the t-integral becomes
  K = ∫₀¹ dt/(1+2t).

This is an elementary integral:
  ∫ dt/(1+2t) = (1/2) ln|1+2t| + C.
Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives
  K = (1/2)[ln(3) – ln(1)] = (1/2) ln 3.

Thus,
  I = (π/4)·(1/2 ln 3) = (π ln 3)/8.

Step 3. Numerical approximation

Now, using
  π ≈ 3.1415926536  and  ln 3 ≈ 1.0986122887,
we find
  I ≈ (3.1415926536 × 1.0986122887)/8 ≈ 3.451392295/8 ≈ 0.4314240369.
