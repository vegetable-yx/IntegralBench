We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀∞ [arctan x]⁄[x (x² + 4)] dx.
A very neat method is to introduce a parameter. Define

  I(λ) = ∫₀∞ (arctan(λx))/(x(x² + 4)) dx,  with λ ∈ [0,1].

Notice that I(1) is the desired value and I(0) = 0 (since arctan 0 = 0). We now differentiate I(λ) with respect to λ. Since the integration converges uniformly (and all steps can be justified), we differentiate under the integral sign:

  dI(λ)/dλ = ∫₀∞ (∂/∂λ)[arctan(λx)]/[x(x² + 4)] dx.

But
  ∂/∂λ [arctan(λx)] = x/(1 + λ²x²),
so that
  dI/dλ = ∫₀∞ [x/(1+λ² x²)]⁄[x(x²+4)] dx = ∫₀∞ 1/[(x²+4)(1+λ² x²)] dx.

Thus we must compute

  J(λ) = ∫₀∞ dx/[(x²+4)(1+λ² x²)].

A standard idea is to decompose the integrand into partial fractions. Write

  1/[(x²+4)(1+λ² x²)] = A/(x²+4) + B/(1+λ² x²).

Multiplying both sides by (x²+4)(1+λ² x²) gives

  1 = A(1+λ² x²) + B(x²+4).

To determine A and B compare coefficients:
• Constant term: A + 4B = 1.
• Coefficient of x²: Aλ² + B = 0.

From the second equation, B = –Aλ². Substitute into the constant term:
  A – 4Aλ² = 1 ⟹ A(1–4λ²) = 1 ⟹ A = 1/(1–4λ²),
and then B = –λ²/(1–4λ²).

Now, we note two standard integrals:
  ∫₀∞ dx/(x²+4) = π/(2·2) = π/4,
and (making the substitution u = λx)
  ∫₀∞ dx/(1+λ² x²) = π/(2λ).

Thus
  J(λ) = A (π/4) + B (π/(2λ))
     = [π/(4(1–4λ²))] – [λ² π/(2λ(1–4λ²))]
     = [π/(4(1–4λ²))] – [πλ/(2(1–4λ²))]
     = [π/(4(1–4λ²))] (1 – 2λ).

But observe that 1–4λ² factors as (1–2λ)(1+2λ) so that
  J(λ) = π(1–2λ)/[4(1–2λ)(1+2λ)] = π/(4(1+2λ))    (for λ such that 1–2λ ≠ 0, but the formula holds by continuity).

Thus we now have the differential equation
  dI/dλ = π/(4(1+2λ)).

Since I(0) = 0, we integrate from 0 to 1:
  I(1) = ∫₀¹ [π/(4(1+2λ))] dλ = π/4 ∫₀¹ dλ/(1+2λ).

A substitution u = 1 + 2λ gives du = 2 dλ, so that
  ∫₀¹ dλ/(1+2λ) = (1/2) ∫₁³ du/u = (1/2) ln(3).

Thus,
  I = I(1) = π/4 · (1/2 ln 3) = (π ln 3)/8.

For a numerical approximation, note that
  π ≈ 3.1415926536 and ln 3 ≈ 1.0986122887,
so that
  I ≈ (3.1415926536 × 1.0986122887)/8 ≈ 3.4513922952/8 ≈ 0.4314240369.
