We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) arccos(sin x) dx.

A useful trick is to “shift” the variable so that the argument of arccos becomes cos of the new variable. Notice that

  sin x = cos(π/2 – x).

Thus if we let

  y = x – π/2     (so that x = y + π/2 and dx = dy),

the limits change as follows:
  when x = 0, y = –π/2,
  when x = 2π, y = 3π/2.

Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫_(y = –π/2)^(3π/2) arccos(sin(y + π/2)) dy
     = ∫_(y = –π/2)^(3π/2) arccos(cos y) dy.

The expression arccos(cos y) has the well-known property that for any real y, its value is given by the distance of y from the nearest multiple of 2π “reflected” into the interval [0, π]. In particular, one may write

  arccos(cos y) =
    |y|     for y in [–π, π],
    2π – y  for y in [π, 2π].

Since our integration interval, [–π/2, 3π/2], spans two regions we break the integral into three pieces:

1. For y ∈ [–π/2, 0]:  
 Since y is negative and |y| = –y (with –y ∈ [0, π/2]),
  arccos(cos y) = –y.
 Thus, I₁ = ∫_(–π/2)⁰ (–y) dy.

2. For y ∈ [0, π]:  
 Here the formula is direct,
  arccos(cos y) = y.
 Thus, I₂ = ∫₀^(π) y dy.

3. For y ∈ [π, 3π/2]:  
 In this range, note that y ∈ [π, 3π/2] ⊂ [π, 2π], and so
  arccos(cos y) = 2π – y.
 Thus, I₃ = ∫_(π)^(3π/2) (2π – y) dy.

We now compute each piece.

Step 1. Compute I₁:
 I₁ = ∫_(–π/2)⁰ (–y) dy.
Let u = –y. Then du = –dy but it is easier to integrate directly:
 I₁ = [ (–y)²/2 ] evaluated appropriately. However, a simpler method is to change the variable of integration. Alternatively, observe that
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) u du    (by substituting u = –y; when y = –π/2, u = π/2; when y = 0, u = 0),
so
  I₁ = [u²/2] from 0 to π/2 = (π/2)²/2 = π²/8.

Step 2. Compute I₂:
 I₂ = ∫₀^(π) y dy = [y²/2]₀^(π) = π²/2.

Step 3. Compute I₃:
 I₃ = ∫_(π)^(3π/2) (2π – y) dy.
Let u = 2π – y. Then du = –dy.
When y = π, u = 2π – π = π.
When y = 3π/2, u = 2π – (3π/2) = π/2.
Thus,
 I₃ = ∫_(u = π)^(π/2) u (–du) = ∫_(u = π/2)^(π) u du 
    = [u²/2]_(π/2)^(π) = (π²/2 – (π/2)²/2) = (π²/2 – π²/8) = (4π²/8 – π²/8) = 3π²/8.

Adding the three pieces gives:
 I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = (π²/8) + (π²/2) + (3π²/8).

Express π²/2 as 4π²/8 so that:
 I = (π²/8 + 4π²/8 + 3π²/8) = 8π²/8 = π².

Thus the exact answer is π².

For the numerical approximation, note that:
 π² ≈ 9.869604401089358,
which rounded to 10 decimal places is 9.8696044011.
