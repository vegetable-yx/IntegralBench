We want to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) arccos(sin x) dx.

Step 1. Express arccos(sin x) in a form that can be integrated.
Notice that sin x can be written as cos(x – π/2), so
  arccos(sin x) = arccos(cos(x – π/2)).
In general, for an angle θ with |θ| ≤ π, we have
  arccos(cos θ) = |θ|  (for θ ∈ [–π, π]).
But here x – π/2 runs from –π/2 (when x = 0) up to 3π/2 (when x = 2π). We therefore break the integration into regions where we can suitably “fold” the angle into the principal range [0, π].

Step 2. Determine the piecewise definition.
For x in [0, 2π]:
1. When x – π/2 is in [–π/2, π], that is, for x ∈ [0, 3π/2],
  arccos(sin x) = |x – π/2|.
2. When x – π/2 is in [π, 3π/2], that is, for x ∈ [3π/2, 2π],
  we use the identity arccos(cos θ) = 2π – θ (since 2π – (x – π/2) falls into [0, π]). Thus,
  arccos(sin x) = 2π – (x – π/2) = (5π/2) – x.

Also note that the absolute value |x – π/2| splits into two parts:
 • For x ∈ [0, π/2]: |x – π/2| = π/2 – x.
 • For x ∈ [π/2, 3π/2]: |x – π/2| = x – π/2.

Step 3. Write the integral as the sum of three parts:
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (π/2 – x) dx + ∫_(π/2)^(3π/2) (x – π/2) dx + ∫_(3π/2)^(2π) [(5π/2) – x] dx.

Now compute each piece.

A. First Integral:
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) (π/2 – x) dx.
Find the antiderivative:
  F(x) = (π/2)x – x²/2.
Evaluating from 0 to π/2:
  I₁ = [(π/2)(π/2) – (π/2)²/2] – [0] = (π²/4 – π²/8) = π²/8.

B. Second Integral:
  I₂ = ∫_(π/2)^(3π/2) (x – π/2) dx.
Let u = x – π/2; then when x = π/2, u = 0 and when x = 3π/2, u = π.
Thus,
  I₂ = ∫₀^π u du = u²/2 │₀^π = π²/2.

C. Third Integral:
  I₃ = ∫_(3π/2)^(2π) [(5π/2) – x] dx.
Its antiderivative is:
  G(x) = (5π/2)x – x²/2.
Evaluate from x = 3π/2 to 2π:
At x = 2π:
  G(2π) = (5π/2)(2π) – (2π)²/2 = 5π² – 2π² = 3π².
At x = 3π/2:
  G(3π/2) = (5π/2)(3π/2) – ( (3π/2)² )/2.
Compute:
  (5π/2)(3π/2) = 15π²/4,
  (3π/2)² = 9π²/4, so divided by 2 gives 9π²/8.
Thus,
  G(3π/2) = 15π²/4 – 9π²/8 = (30π²/8 – 9π²/8) = 21π²/8.
So,
  I₃ = G(2π) – G(3π/2) = 3π² – 21π²/8 = (24π²/8 – 21π²/8) = 3π²/8.

Step 4. Summing the three parts:
  I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = (π²/8) + (π²/2) + (3π²/8).
Express π²/2 as 4π²/8:
  I = (π²/8) + (4π²/8) + (3π²/8) = (8π²/8) = π².

Thus the exact answer is π².

Step 5. Provide a numerical approximation.
We have π² ≈ 9.869604401089358, which rounded to 10 decimal places is 9.8696044011.
