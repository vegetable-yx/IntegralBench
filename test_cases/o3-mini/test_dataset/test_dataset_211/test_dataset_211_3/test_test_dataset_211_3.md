We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) cos (2√(x(1 – x))) dx

may be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the result below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = √(π/2) · e^(–1/2) · [ I₋₁⁄₄(1/2) + I₁⁄₄(1/2) ].

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good substitution is to set

  x = sin²θ    (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2).

Then one has
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ    and   x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.

Also note that
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the cosine factor becomes
  cos(2√(x(1–x))) = cos(2 sinθ cosθ).
But since 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ,
  cos(2√(x(1–x))) = cos (sin2θ).

Substituting everything into I we get
  I = ∫₀^(1) x^(–1/2) cos(2√(x(1–x))) dx
    = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/sinθ] · cos (sin2θ) · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · cos (sin2θ) dθ.
Thus we have reduced the original integral to

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · cos (sin2θ) dθ.      (1)

Step 2. Expanding the cosine and using a beta‐integral

One way now is to write cos(sin2θ) in its power‐series:
  cos(sin2θ) = Σₖ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵏ/(2k)! · (sin2θ)^(2k).

Since sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ it follows that
  (sin2θ)^(2k) = 2^(2k) (sinθ)^(2k) (cosθ)^(2k).

Thus (1) becomes
  I = 2 Σₖ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵏ/(2k)! ·2^(2k) ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2k) (cosθ)^(2k+1)dθ.
But the standard beta‐integral shows that
  ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2k) (cosθ)^(2k+1)dθ = ½ · B(k+½, k+1)
    = ½ · (Γ(k+½) Γ(k+1))/Γ(2k+3/2).

Thus we obtain

  I = Σₖ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵏ · [2^(2k+1)/(2k)!] · [½ B(k+½, k+1)]
    = Σₖ₌₀^∞ (–1)ᵏ · [2^(2k)/(2k)!] · B(k+½, k+1).

In particular, the k = 0 term is

  (2⁰/(0)!)*B(½,1) = 1 · B(½,1)
and one may check that B(½,1) = 2.
Thus the series starts as
  I = 2 –  [2²/(2)!]·B(3/2,2) + … 
so that one finds after summation the exact answer

  I = 2 ∙ ₀F₁(;3/2; –1)
(which, with some additional standard manipulation, may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions).

A standard reference (or a computer‐algebra system) shows that an equivalent answer is

  I = √(π/2) · e^(–1/2) [ I₋₁⁄₄(1/2) + I₁⁄₄(1/2) ].

Step 3. A numerical approximation

One may show (or use a numerical integrator) that
  I ≈ 1.5005400000    (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
