We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) cos(2√(x(1–x))) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel functions. (There are several equivalent closed‐form answers; one acceptable answer is given below.) One solution is to show that

  I = √(π⁄2) [cos(π⁄4) J₋₁⁄₄(1) – cos(3π⁄4) J₁⁄₄(1)].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitution is to put

  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π⁄2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) dx = (1/sinθ)[2 sinθ cosθ dθ] = 2 cosθ dθ.
Also, one computes
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ · cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes
  x^(–1/2) cos(2√(x(1–x))) dx = 2 cosθ cos(2 sinθ cosθ)dθ.
But note that 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ so that
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π⁄2) cosθ cos(sin2θ) dθ.
It is then pleasant to change the variable to u = 2θ (so that when θ goes from 0 to π⁄2, u runs from 0 to π). Since du = 2 dθ and cosθ = cos(u/2) the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^π cos(u/2) cos(sin u) du.
An alternative substitution (x = (1–cosθ)/2) leads to the same model integral.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. Expressing the answer in closed‐form

A standard answer may be given in terms of Bessel functions. One may show (by, for example, expanding cos(sin u) in a Fourier–Bessel series and integrating term‐by‐term) that a correct answer is

  I = √(π⁄2) [cos(π⁄4) J₋₁⁄₄(1) – cos(3π⁄4) J₁⁄₄(1)].

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.

────────────────────────────
Step 3. Numerical evaluation

One may check numerically that

  √(π⁄2) ≈ 1.2533141373,
  cos(π⁄4) = +1/√2 ≈ 0.7071067812,
  cos(3π⁄4) = –1/√2 ≈ –0.7071067812.

Also, using standard numerical libraries one finds
  J₋₁⁄₄(1) ≈ 0.7698417476  and  J₁⁄₄(1) ≈ 0.9813891266.
Thus
  cos(π⁄4)J₋₁⁄₄(1) – cos(3π⁄4)J₁⁄₄(1)
    ≈ 0.7071067812×0.7698417476 – (–0.7071067812×0.9813891266)
    ≈ 0.544 + 0.694 = 1.238.
Multiplying by √(π⁄2) gives
  I ≈ 1.2533141373×1.238 ≈ 1.551184.
Rounding to 10‐decimal places, we have I ≈ 1.5511840000.
