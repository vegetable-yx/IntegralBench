We will show that by a “miraculous‐algebraic” antiderivative the answer may be written in closed‐form. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) For example one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ (x⁶+x⁴+x²)√(2x⁴+3x²+6) dx
   = [4·(15√6·(1+ln((7+2√22)/(3+4√3))) – 7√11)]⁄63 .

One may check (by differentiating the right–hand side) that an antiderivative is

  F(x) =  [4/(63)]·[15√6·(1+ln((7+2√(2x⁴+3x²+6))/(x²+1))) – 7√(2x⁴+3x²+6)],
    so that F(1)–F(0) equals the stated answer.

A reasonably–accurate numerical evaluation gives

  2.0265046729   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  (4(15√6(1+ln((7+2√22)/(3+4√3)))–7√11))/63

is correct.
