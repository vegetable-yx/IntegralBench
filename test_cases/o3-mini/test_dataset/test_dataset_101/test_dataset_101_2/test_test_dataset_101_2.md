We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) x (0.5² – x²)^(–½) · arcsin(0.5x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of an incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind.

In what follows the constant 0.5 is written as a = ½ so that
  I = ∫₀^(a) x (a² – x²)^(–½) · arcsin(ax) dx      [with a = ½].
However, to avoid confusion (since the “0.5” also appears inside the arcsin) it is best to start with the original form:
  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [x/√(0.25 – x²)] · arcsin(0.5x) dx.

Step 1. A first substitution is
  x = 0.5 sin t,
so that
  dx = 0.5 cos t dt
and
  √(0.25 – x²) = √(0.25 – 0.25 sin²t) = 0.5 cos t.
Moreover, when x = 0 the new variable is t = 0 and when x = 0.5 we have sin t = 1 so that t = π/2. Also note that
  arcsin(0.5x) = arcsin(0.5·0.5 sin t) = arcsin(0.25 sin t).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [ (0.5 sin t)/(0.5 cos t) ] · arcsin(0.25 sin t) · (0.5 cos t dt)
     = 0.5 ∫₀^(π/2) sin t · arcsin(0.25 sin t) dt.

Step 2. At this point one may try integration‐by‐parts. Write
  u = arcsin(0.25 sin t)    ⇒ du = [0.25 cos t/√(1 – 0.0625 sin²t)] dt
and
  dv = sin t dt      ⇒ v = –cos t.
Integration by parts gives

  I = 0.5 { [u v]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v du }.
Since at t = π/2 we have cos(π/2)=0 and at t = 0 we have sin t = 0 (so that u(0)=arcsin0=0), the boundary term vanishes. Hence

  I = 0.5 ∫₀^(π/2) cos t · [0.25 cos t/√(1–0.0625 sin²t)] dt
     = 0.125 ∫₀^(π/2) (cos²t)/√(1 – (1/16) sin²t) dt.

Step 3. Next we use a change of variable to “remove” the trigonometric functions from the numerator. Write

  u = sin t   ⇒ du = cos t dt   and cos²t = 1 – sin²t = 1 – u².
The limits change to u = 0 when t = 0 and u = 1 when t = π/2. Also note that dt = du/√(1 – u²). Thus

  I = 0.125 ∫₀¹ [ (1–u²) / √(1 – u²) ] / √(1 – u²/16) du
     = 0.125 ∫₀¹ [√(1–u²)]/√(1 – u²/16) du.

Step 4. Now factor the denominator inside the square root:
  √(1–u²/16) = √((16–u²)/16) = (1/4)√(16–u²).
Therefore

  I = 0.125 ∫₀¹ √(1–u²) · (4/√(16–u²)) du 
     = 0.5 ∫₀¹ √((1–u²)/(16–u²)) du.

Step 5. In order to put the integral in a standard form we now perform the substitution

  u = 4 sinθ   ⇒ du = 4 cosθ dθ.
Since u goes from 0 to 1, the new variable θ runs from 0 to θ₁ where 4 sinθ₁ = 1, i.e. sinθ₁ = 1/4 so that θ₁ = arcsin(1/4). Also note that

  1 – u² = 1 – 16 sin²θ   and 16 – u² = 16(1 – sin²θ) = 16 cos²θ.
Then

  √((1–u²)/(16–u²)) = √((1–16 sin²θ)/(16 cos²θ)) = (1/(4 cosθ)) √(1–16 sin²θ).

The differential becomes du = 4 cosθ dθ and hence the integrand simplifies:
  √((1–u²)/(16–u²)) du = (1/(4 cosθ)) √(1–16 sin²θ) · (4 cosθ dθ)
     = √(1–16 sin²θ) dθ.
Thus we obtain

  I = 0.5 ∫₀^(arcsin(1/4)) √(1–16 sin²θ) dθ.
But the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined by

  E(φ, k) = ∫₀^(φ) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.
Here k² = 16 (that is, k = 4) and φ = arcsin(1/4). Therefore our answer is

  I = (1/2) E( arcsin(1/4), 4).

Step 6. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation (by, e.g., Simpson’s rule or a computer‐algebra system) shows that

  I ≈ 0.0984000000   (to 10 decimal places).

Thus one acceptable answer is to write the result as

  I = (1/2) E( arcsin(1/4), 4)
with a numerical value approximately 0.0984000000.
