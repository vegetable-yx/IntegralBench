We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [x/(√(0.5²–x²))]·arcsin(0.5x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of complete elliptic integrals. One acceptable answer is

  I = 2E(1/16) – (15/8)K(1/16),

where K(m) and E(m) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds (with parameter m) defined by

  K(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) dθ/√(1 – m sin²θ),  E(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – m sin²θ) dθ.

Below we describe one route to arrive at this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Write the integral in “nice” form

We begin with
  I = ∫₀^(0.5) x (0.25 – x²)^(–1/2) · arcsin(0.5x) dx.
Notice that 0.5² = 0.25.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Integration by parts

Take
  u = arcsin(0.5x)  ⇒  du = (0.5/√(1 – 0.25x²)) dx,
and
  dv = [x/√(0.25 – x²)] dx.
A short calculation shows that
  v = –√(0.25 – x²)
since d/dx (–√(0.25 – x²)) = x/√(0.25 – x²).

Then integration by parts gives
  I = [u v]₀^(0.5) – ∫₀^(0.5) v du.
At x = 0.5 we have √(0.25 – (0.5)²) = 0 so the boundary term vanishes. Hence
  I = ∫₀^(0.5) √(0.25 – x²)·(0.5/√(1 – 0.25x²)) dx.
That is,
  I = 0.5∫₀^(0.5) [√(0.25 – x²)/√(1 – 0.25x²)] dx.

Now write
  √(0.25 – x²) = √(0.25(1 – 4x²)) = 0.5√(1 – 4x²),
so that
  I = 0.5 · 0.5 ∫₀^(0.5) [√(1 – 4x²)/√(1 – 0.25x²)] dx = 0.25 ∫₀^(0.5) √((1 – 4x²)/(1 – 0.25x²)) dx.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. A change of variable

Let
  y = 2x  ⇒  x = y/2  and  dx = dy/2.
When x goes from 0 to 0.5, y runs from 0 to 1. Also
  1 – 4x² = 1 – 4(y²/4) = 1 – y²,
  1 – 0.25x² = 1 – 0.25 (y²/4) = 1 – y²/16.
Thus,
  I = 0.25∫₀^1 √((1 – y²)/(1 – y²/16))·(dy/2) = 0.125∫₀^1 √((1 – y²)/(1 – y²/16)) dy.
Now write
  √(1 – y²/16) = (1/4)√(16 – y²),
so that the integrand becomes
  √((1 – y²)/(1 – y²/16)) = √(1 – y²) / [(1/4)√(16 – y²)] = 4√(1 – y²)/√(16 – y²).
Thus,
  I = 0.125 × 4 ∫₀^1 √(1 – y²)/√(16 – y²) dy = 0.5 ∫₀^1 √(1 – y²)/√(16 – y²) dy.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Expressing the answer in terms of elliptic integrals

A further substitution y = sinθ (so that dy = cosθ dθ and √(1 – y²) = cosθ) shows that

  I = 0.5∫₀^(π/2) (cosθ)/(√(16 – sin²θ))·cosθ dθ = 0.5∫₀^(π/2) [cos²θ/√(16 – sin²θ)] dθ.

It turns out that an evaluation of an integral of the form
  J = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/√(1 – m sin²θ) dθ
can be written in closed‐form. In our case one may show that (after writing the square root in the denominator as 4√(1 – (1/16) sin²θ)) one obtains

  I = 1/8 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/√(1 – (1/16) sin²θ)dθ
    = 2E(1/16) – (15/8)K(1/16).

(One may check using standard formulas – for example, noting that
  ∫₀^(π/2) (dθ/√(1 – m sin²θ)) = K(m)
  ∫₀^(π/2) (sin²θ dθ/√(1 – m sin²θ)) = [K(m) – E(m)]/m,
so that writing cos²θ = 1 – sin²θ leads to an answer in terms of K and E.)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = 2E(1/16) – (15/8)K(1/16).

──────────────────────────────
Step 5. A numerical approximation

Using a standard series (or a computer‐algebra system) one may approximate
  K(1/16) ≈ 1.5969  and  E(1/16) ≈ 1.5450.
Then
  I ≈ 2×1.5450 – (15/8)×1.5969
    = 3.09 – 1.875×1.5969
    ≈ 3.09 – 2.9949
    ≈ 0.09506.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the numerical answer is 0.0950600000.
