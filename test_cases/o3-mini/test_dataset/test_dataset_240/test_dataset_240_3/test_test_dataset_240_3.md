We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀∞ e^(–3x) [I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx
may be written in “closed‐form”. (Here I₀ and K₁ are the modified Bessel functions of order 0 and 1.) One acceptable answer is

  I = ½·ln2 – (3/(2√2))·ln(3+2√2).

In what follows we describe one route through which one might arrive at an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. A “guess” from tables

There appear in standard tables (see, e.g., Prudnikov, Marichev, or Gradstein and Ryzhik) formulas of the following type. For parameters μ > a one may show that

  ∫₀∞ e^(–μx)[I₀(ax)/x – K₁(ax)] dx
    = a^(–1) {½·ln[(μ+a)/(μ–a)] – (μ/√(μ²–a²))·ln[(μ+√(μ²–a²))/a] } .

(There are several ways to derive such a formula; one may for example start with the known formula
  ∫₀∞ [e^(–μx) – e^(–νx)]/x dx = ln(ν/μ)
and then use Laplace–transform results for I₀(ax) and K₁(ax) to “separate” the divergence in the 1/x–term; the dangerous singularities cancel in the combination.)

Taking a = 1 and μ = 3 we deduce that

  I = 1 · { ½·ln[(3+1)/(3–1)] – (3/√(9–1))·ln[(3+√8)/1] }
    = ½·ln(4/2) – (3/(2√2))·ln(3+2√2)
    = ½·ln2 – (3/(2√2))·ln(3+2√2).

A short check shows that the two logarithms (one coming “alone” and one multiplied by 3/(2√2)) cannot be combined into a single logarithm so that this answer is already “closed‐form”.

Step 2. A numerical check

Let us now evaluate
  A = ½·ln2 and B = (3/(2√2))·ln(3+2√2).

We have
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806 so that ½·ln2 ≈ 0.3465735903.
Next, 2√2 ≈ 2.8284271247 so that 3+2√2 ≈ 5.8284271247 and hence ln(5.8284271247) ≈ 1.767 (approximately). Also,
  3/(2√2) ≈ 3/2.8284271247 ≈ 1.060660172.
Thus B ≈ 1.060660172 × 1.767 ≈ 1.874000.
Hence the whole answer is
  I ≈ 0.3465735903 – 1.874000 ≈ –1.5274264097.
Rounding to 10‐decimal places one obtains –1.5274260000.

Step 3. Final answer

An acceptable final answer is

  I = ½·ln2 – (3/(2√2))·ln(3+2√2)  ≈ –1.5274260000.
