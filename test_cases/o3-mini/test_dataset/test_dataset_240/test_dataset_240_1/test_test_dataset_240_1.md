We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ e^(–3x) [I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here I₀ and K₁ denote the modified Bessel functions of orders 0 and 1, respectively.) In fact one may prove the following identity valid for any real s > 1:

  ∫₀∞ e^(–s x) [I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx = ½ ln[(s + 1)/(s – 1)].  (1)

A way to “discover” an identity like (1) is to show that the left‐side (which is defined only as a combination because each term has a nonintegrable singularity at x = 0, but the singularities cancel) is “regularized” and it turns out that its derivative with respect to s can be computed and identified with the derivative of ½ ln[(s + 1)/(s – 1)]. (There exist several methods to show (1) – for example, by writing an integral representation for I₀ and for K₁, interchanging integrations, and then using standard integrals – but we omit those technical details here.)

In our problem we have s = 3. Thus from (1)

  I = ½ ln[(3 + 1)/(3 – 1)] = ½ ln(4/2) = ½ ln 2.

A short “sanity check” shows that for s > 1 the right–side is positive and tends to 0 for s → ∞ and blows up as s ↓ 1. This agrees with the fact that in our original integral the cancellation of the 1/x–singularities at x = 0 produces a finite result.

We now provide the numerical value. Since

  ½ ln 2 ≈ 0.5 × 0.6931471805599453 ≈ 0.3465735902799726,

rounded to ten‐decimal places the answer is 0.3465735903.
