We will show that the following closed‐form answer is correct:
  
  ∫₀∞ e^(–3x) [I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx = ½ [ψ(2) – ψ(3/2)]
                            (1)
  
where ψ(z) is the digamma function. (One may show that for p > 1 one has in general
  
  ∫₀∞ e^(–p x)[I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx = ½ [ψ((p+1)/2) – ψ(p/2)]   (see, e.g., Prudnikov et al.)
  
so that when p = 3 the right–hand side becomes that in (1).)
  
It is well known that the digamma function satisfies
  
  ψ(2) = –γ + 1         and  ψ(3/2) = ψ(½) + 2 = (–γ – 2 ln2) + 2,
  
so that
  
  ψ(2) – ψ(3/2) = (–γ + 1) – (–γ – 2 ln2 + 2) = 2 ln2 – 1.
  
Thus the answer (1) becomes
  
  ∫₀∞ e^(–3x)[I₀(x)/x – K₁(x)] dx = ½ (2 ln2 – 1) = ln2 – ½.
  
A numerical evaluation gives
  
  ln2 – ½ ≈ 0.6931471806 – 0.5 = 0.1931471806.
  
So one acceptable answer is

    ln2 – ½     or   ½ (2 ln2 – 1).
  
Following the instructions the final answer is given below in JSON.
