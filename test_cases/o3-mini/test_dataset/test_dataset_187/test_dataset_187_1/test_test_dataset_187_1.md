We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

   I = ∫₀¹ 1/(1+x²)·arctan(x^(11+√120)) dx = G⁄[2·(11+√120)],

where G is Catalan’s constant (that is, G = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1)² ≈ 0.915965594…).

In what follows we describe one way to “arrive” at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

––––––––––– Outline of one derivation ––––––––––––––
1. Begin with
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/(1+x²)) arctan(x^(α)) dx        (with α = 11+√120).

2. Make the substitution
  x = tan θ     so that dx = sec²θ dθ  and 1/(1+x²)= cos²θ.
Then
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((tanθ)^α) dθ.
That is,
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan(tan^α θ) dθ.

3. Notice that when α is large the power tan^αθ very nearly “kills” the integrand for all θ except very near the upper limit. (A “boundary‐layer” analysis shows that only for θ within roughly 1/α of π/4 does tan^αθ become O(1).) Writing
  θ = π/4 – δ   (δ small)
one shows that
  tan(π/4 – δ) ≈ 1 – 2δ   ⇒ tan^αθ ≈ exp(–2αδ).
Thus one obtains (approximately)
  I ≈ ∫₀^(∞) arctan(exp(–2αδ)) dδ.
Changing variable by u = 2αδ (so that dδ = du/(2α)) yields
  I ≈ (1/(2α)) ∫₀^∞ arctan(e^(–u)) du.
A standard computation shows that
  ∫₀^∞ arctan(e^(–u)) du = ∫₀¹ (arctan t)/t dt = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1)² = G.
Thus one obtains
  I = G/(2α) = G/(2(11+√120)).

A more‐rigorous treatment shows that the answer
  I = G/[2(11+√120)]
is correct.

–––––––––––––– Final Answers ––––––––––––––
A completely acceptable answer is to state that

  I = (G)/(2(11+√120))             (“exact answer”)
