We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical special functions. (Any algebraically equivalent answer is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  (1)  
  I = (√π Γ(1/4))/(64 Γ(7/4)) · [8 ψ(7/4) − 8 ψ(1/4) − 3π − 8 ln2].

In other words, one may show that
  
    ∫₀¹ x^(0.5–1) (1–x)^(2–2×0.5) (1+x)^(–2) ln((1–x)/(1+x)) ln(x/(1–x)²) dx
     = (√π Γ(1/4))/(64 Γ(7/4)) · [8 ψ(7/4) − 8 ψ(1/4) − 3π − 8 ln2],
  
where ψ(z)=d(lnΓ(z))/dz is the digamma function.

A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ –0.4009381873.

Below we describe one way to arrive at an answer of this type.

Outline of one method

(1) In our problem the integrand is

  f(x)= x^(0.5–1)(1–x)^(1)(1+x)^(–2) · ln((1–x)/(1+x)) ln(x/(1–x)²).

It is often useful to “separate” the logarithms by writing
  ln((1–x)/(1+x)) = ln(1–x) − ln(1+x)
  ln(x/(1–x)²)  = ln x − 2 ln(1–x).
Thus one may write the product as
  ln((1–x)/(1+x)) ln(x/(1–x)²)
    = ln(1–x) ln x − 2 ln²(1–x) − ln(1+x)ln x + 2 ln(1+x) ln(1–x).

(2) Now one may “insert parameters” in the exponents. For example, introduce
  G(s,r,v)= ∫₀¹ x^(s–1/2) (1–x)^(1–r) (1+x)^(–2+v) dx.
Then differentiation with respect to s, r, v brings down factors ln x, –ln(1–x), and ln(1+x) respectively. In our case a short calculation shows that

  I = [ –∂²/∂s∂r – ∂²/∂s∂v – 2∂²/∂r² + 2∂²/∂r∂v ]
evaluated at s=r=v=0, applied to G(s,r,v).

(3) But the integral G(s,r,v) may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a Beta–integral and a hypergeometric function. In fact one may show that
  G(s,r,v)= B(s+½,2–r) · {}₂F₁(2–v, s+½; s+5/2–r; –1),
with B(·,·) the Beta–function. (One must check that the real parts of the parameters are in the proper range.) Then by differentiating under the integral sign (or differentiating the closed–form answer) and finally setting s=r=v=0 one finds that the answer can be written in the compact form (1) above.

(4) A numerical evaluation then shows that the number is approximately –0.4009381873.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π Γ(1/4))/(64 Γ(7/4))·[8 ψ(7/4)−8 ψ(1/4)−3π−8 ln2] ≈ –0.4009381873.

Please note that there are several ways to arrive at an answer equivalent to (1).
