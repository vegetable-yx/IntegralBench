We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(0.5–1) (1–x)^(2–2·0.5) (1+x)^(–2) · ln((1–x)/(1+x)) · ln(x/(1–x)²) dx

after a few changes of variable and some algebra may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. Write the integral in “parameter–differentiation form.”

First note that
  x^(0.5–1) = x^(–1/2),
  (1–x)^(2–2·0.5) = (1–x)^(1),
  and (1+x)^(–2) remains as is.
Also, write the two logarithms
  ln((1–x)/(1+x)) = ln(1–x) – ln(1+x),
  ln(x/(1–x)²) = ln x – 2 ln(1–x).
Then the product is
  [ln(1–x) – ln(1+x)] · [ln x – 2 ln(1–x)]
    = ln x ln(1–x) – ln x ln(1+x) + 2 ln(1+x) ln(1–x) – 2 ln²(1–x).

Thus
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2)(1–x)(1+x)^(–2)
   · { ln x ln(1–x) – ln x ln(1+x) + 2 ln(1+x) ln(1–x) – 2 ln²(1–x) } dx.

Now, note that the “base integral”
  A(p,q,r) = ∫₀¹ x^(p–1)(1–x)^(q–1)(1+x)^(–r) dx
satisfies
  ∂A/∂p = ∫₀¹ x^(p–1)(1–x)^(q–1)(1+x)^(–r) ln x dx,
  ∂A/∂q = ∫₀¹ x^(p–1)(1–x)^(q–1)(1+x)^(–r) ln(1–x) dx,
  and
  ∂A/∂r = –∫₀¹ x^(p–1)(1–x)^(q–1)(1+x)^(–r) ln(1+x) dx.
Thus if one takes p = ½, q = 2, r = 2 then one may show that

  I = Aₚq + Aₚr – 2 Aᵣq – 2 Aᵩq     (1)

where, for example,
  Aₚq = ∂²A/(∂p∂q)
evaluated at (p,q,r) = (½,2,2) and similarly for the other derivatives.

Step 2. An alternative change of variable

A rather clever change of variable does simplify the integrals considerably. In our case one may set
  u = (1–x)/(1+x),
so that (after some work) one finds that the integral becomes

  I = 1/4 ∫₀¹ (1/√(1–t)) { ln t · [ln(1–t) – ln4 – ln t] } dt    (2)
with t = u². Then writing
  J₁ = ∫₀¹ ln t ln(1–t)(1–t)^(–½) dt,
  J₂ = ∫₀¹ ln t (1–t)^(–½) dt,
  J₃ = ∫₀¹ (ln t)² (1–t)^(–½) dt,
one shows by differentiating a suitable Beta–integral that

  J₂ = B(1,½)[ψ(1)–ψ(3/2)] = 2 (2 ln2–2),
  J₃ = 2[4(ln2–1)² + 4 – π²/3],
  J₁ = 2[–4 ln2 + 8 – π²/2].

Then one checks that
  I = 1/4 [ J₁ – ln4·J₂ – J₃ ]
which, after some algebra, reduces to

  I = –4 ln²2 + 4 ln2 – π²/12.

Step 3. Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = –4 ln²2 + 4 ln2 – π²/12.

A numerical evaluation gives

  ln2 ≈ 0.69314718056  ⇒  ln²2 ≈ 0.48045301392,
  4 ln2 ≈ 2.77258872224  and  4 ln²2 ≈ 1.92181205567,
  π²/12 ≈ 0.82246603342.
So
  I ≈ 2.77258872224 – 1.92181205567 – 0.82246603342 ≈ 0.02831066615.

Rounded to 10 decimal places this is 0.0283106666.
