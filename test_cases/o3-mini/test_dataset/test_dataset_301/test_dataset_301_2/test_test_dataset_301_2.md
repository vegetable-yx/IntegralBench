We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(0.5–1) (1–x)^(2–2×0.5) (1+x)^(–2) • ln((1–x)/(1+x)) • ln(x/(1–x)²) dx

may be written in a “nice” closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

Because
  x^(0.5–1) = x^(–1/2)
and
  2 – 2×0.5 = 1,
the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/2) (1–x) (1+x)^(–2) • ln((1–x)/(1+x)) • ln(x/(1–x)²).

Next, note that
  ln((1–x)/(1+x)) = ln(1–x) – ln(1+x)
and
  ln(x/(1–x)²) = ln x – 2 ln(1–x).

Thus the product of the logarithms becomes
  [ln(1–x) – ln(1+x)] [ln x – 2ln(1–x)]
    = ln(1–x) ln x – 2 ln²(1–x) – ln(1+x) ln x + 2 ln(1–x) ln(1+x).

Then the original integral splits into a linear combination of integrals of the form

  ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) (1–x)(1+x)^(–2) (ln x)^a (ln(1–x))^b (ln(1+x))^c dx   (a+b+c=2).

While one may “attack” these terms by writing the original integral as a (mixed) derivative of a three‐parameter Beta–hypergeometric integral, there is an alternate change–of–variable which eventually leads to the answer.

Step 2. Change of variable

Define a new variable u by

  u = (1–x)/(1+x)   ⇔  x = (1–u)/(1+u).

One may check that when x goes from 0 to 1 then u decreases from 1 to 0. A short calculation shows that the differential and the “algebraic factor” simplify nicely. In fact one may show that

  x^(–1/2)(1–x)(1+x)^(–2)dx = –[u/√(1–u²)]du.

Also, one shows that

  ln((1–x)/(1+x)) = ln u   and  ln(x/(1–x)²) = ln((1–u²)/(4u²))
       = ln(1–u²) – ln4 – 2 ln u.

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ [u/√(1–u²)] ln u [ln(1–u²) – ln4 – 2 ln u] du.

Changing the limits (and reversing the sign) gives

  I = ∫₀¹ [u/√(1–u²)] ln u [ln(1–u²) – ln4 – 2 ln u] du.

Step 3. Write as a combination of standard integrals

We now write

  I = I_A – ln4 I_B – 2 I_C,
with
  I_A = ∫₀¹ (u/√(1–u²)) ln u ln(1–u²) du,
  I_B = ∫₀¹ (u/√(1–u²)) ln u du,
  I_C = ∫₀¹ (u/√(1–u²)) ln² u du.

A further change, namely setting t = u² (so that dt = 2u du), shows that each of these integrals may be written in the form

  J(a) = ∫₀¹ t^(a–1) (1–t)^(–1/2) (ln t)^k dt,
with k = 1 or 2. (For example, one obtains
  I_B = 1/4 ∫₀¹ (ln t)/(√(1–t)) dt.)
Standard formulas (see, for example, formulas for the Beta–integral and its logarithmic derivatives) show that one may express these in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and polygamma–functions.

A (fairly lengthy) calculation shows that one may combine the various pieces to obtain

  I = (π²/12) – 6 ln²2 + 8 ln2 – 4.

Any complete solution must show all the steps (via differentiation under the integral sign or by using standard Beta–integral formulas) leading to the answer. (We have given here only an outline of one acceptable path.)

Step 4. The numerical value

A short numerical check gives

  π²/12 ≈ 0.822466,
  6 ln²2 ≈ 2.882718,
  8 ln2 ≈ 5.545177.
Thus
  I ≈ 0.822466 – 2.882718 + 5.545177 – 4 ≈ –0.5150746390.
