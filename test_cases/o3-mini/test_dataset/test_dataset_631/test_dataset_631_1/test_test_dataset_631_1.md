We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₋₁¹ (cos x)/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx.

Step 1. Note that the integrand is not even or odd, but we can uncover a symmetry by considering its value at –x. Define
  f(x) = cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)).
Then
  f(–x) = cos(–x)/(1 + e^(–1/(–x))) = cos x/(1 + e^(1/x))
since cos(–x) = cos x.

Step 2. Add f(x) and f(–x):
  f(x) + f(–x) = cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) + cos x/(1 + e^(1/x))
       = cos x [1/(1 + e^(–1/x)) + 1/(1 + e^(1/x))].

Notice that for any real number a, it holds that
  1/(1 + e^(a)) + 1/(1 + e^(–a)) = 1.
(To check, set A = e^(a); then 1/(1+A) + A/(1+A) = (1+A)/(1+A) = 1.)

Thus, letting a = 1/x, we have
  1/(1 + e^(–1/x)) + 1/(1 + e^(1/x)) = 1,
so that
  f(x) + f(–x) = cos x.

Step 3. With this result, notice that
  I + I = ∫₋₁¹ f(x) dx + ∫₋₁¹ f(–x) dx = ∫₋₁¹ [f(x) + f(–x)] dx = ∫₋₁¹ cos x dx.

Since the substitution x ↦ –x leaves the limits unchanged, the two integrals are equal, so we have
  2I = ∫₋₁¹ cos x dx.

Step 4. Now, compute the integral of cos x over [–1,1]:
  ∫₋₁¹ cos x dx = sin x |₋₁¹ = sin(1) – sin(–1) = sin(1) + sin(1) = 2 sin(1).

Thus, it follows that
  2I = 2 sin(1)
⟹ I = sin(1).

Step 5. The exact answer is sin(1). Numerically, using sin(1) ≈ 0.8414709848 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
