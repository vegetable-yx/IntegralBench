We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx.

Step 1. Observe the potential issue at x = 0. To handle this, we split the integral as

  I = ∫₋₁⁰ cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx + ∫₀¹ cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx.

Step 2. Substitute u = –x in the first integral. Then du = –dx, and when x goes from –1 to 0, u goes from 1 to 0. Also, cos x = cos(–u) = cos u. Thus

  ∫₋₁⁰ cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx = ∫₁⁰ cos u/(1 + e^(–1/(–u))) (–du).

Notice that
  e^(–1/(–u)) = e^(1/u).

Reversing the limits, we get

  = ∫₀¹ cos u/(1 + e^(1/u)) du.

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ cos x/(1 + e^(–1/x)) dx + ∫₀¹ cos x/(1 + e^(1/x)) dx.

Step 3. Factor cos x and combine:

  I = ∫₀¹ cos x [1/(1 + e^(–1/x)) + 1/(1 + e^(1/x))] dx.

Step 4. For any real t, we claim that

  1/(1 + e^(–t)) + 1/(1 + e^(t)) = 1.

To verify, letting t = 1/x, we have

  1/(1 + e^(–1/x)) + 1/(1 + e^(1/x)) = e^(1/x)/(1 + e^(1/x)) + 1/(1 + e^(1/x)) = [e^(1/x) + 1]/(1 + e^(1/x)) = 1.

Thus, the integrand simplifies to cos x and

  I = ∫₀¹ cos x dx.

Step 5. Evaluate the remaining integral:

  ∫₀¹ cos x dx = sin x |₀¹ = sin(1) – sin(0) = sin(1).

Step 6. Final answer:

Exact Answer: sin(1).

The numerical value of sin(1) (with x in radians) is approximately 0.8414709848 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
