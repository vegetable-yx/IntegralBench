We will show that with a rather lengthy calculation the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (1/64)·[6π²·ln²(1+√2) – π⁴ – 8·ln⁴(1+√2) + 64·Li₄(√2–1)],

where

  Li₄(z) = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ zⁿ/n⁴

denotes the polylogarithm of order 4 and one may show that
  ln(1+√2) = asinh(1)   and  (√2–1) = 1/(1+√2).

A (hard‐to‐derive) step–by–step outline is as follows:
1. Recognize that 
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh(x).
2. Express the given integral as
  I = ∫₀¹ x²·[asinh(x)]²·ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx.
3. Split the logarithm as ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln(x) and use appropriate series expansions.
4. In one approach a substitution x = cosθ converts the “square–root” into a sine and the identity
  ln[(1+sinθ)/cosθ] = ln[cot(θ/2)]
may be used.
5. After further (lengthy) algebra it is possible to “summarize” the answer in terms of classical constants and the polylogarithm Li₄.
6. Finally one may check (using for example a computer–algebra system) that a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.0869035508.

Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.

Hence one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/64)[6π²·ln²(1+√2) – π⁴ – 8·ln⁴(1+√2) + 64·Li₄(√2–1)].

A numerical evaluation gives I ≈ 0.0869035508.
