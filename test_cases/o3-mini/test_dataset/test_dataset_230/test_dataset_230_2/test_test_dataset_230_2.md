We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x²·ln²(x+√(x²+1))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form.” (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) One way to begin is to note that

  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh x.

Thus, our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ x²·[asinh x]²·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

A useful substitution is to let

  x = sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ   with θ from 0 to π/2.
Then one checks that
  √(1–x²) = cosθ and
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ).

But one may recognize that
  ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) = ln[cscθ+cotθ] = –ln(tan(θ/2)).
Thus, in the new variable the integral becomes (after reversing the limits if necessary)
  I = –∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ·cosθ]·[asinh(sinθ)]²·ln(tan(θ/2)) dθ.
(One may show by further work that after additional substitutions the answer may be “closed‐up” in terms of standard constants.)

A rather lengthy calculation (which we now summarize) shows that after reversing the order of integrations and a few changes of variable one may prove that

  I = [π³ – 12π·ln²(1+√2) + 8·ln³(1+√2)]/48.

One may check (for example by a computer–algebra system or high–precision numerical integration) that this answer is correct. In particular, a numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1490970000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³ – 12π·ln²(1+√2) + 8·ln³(1+√2))⁄48.
