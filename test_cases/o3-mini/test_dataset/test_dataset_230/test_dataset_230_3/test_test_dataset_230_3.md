We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/48)·[ –8√2 ln³(1+√2) + 4(π²–6) ln²(1+√2) + 8√2(π²–6) ln(1+√2)
         – π²(π²–12) + 24 Li₂(1–√2) + 48 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) ] .

In other words, one may show that

  ∫₀¹ x²·ln²(x+√(x²+1))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx
    = (–8√2 ln³(1+√2) + 4(π²–6) ln²(1+√2) + 8√2(π²–6) ln(1+√2)
       – π²(π²–12) + 24 Li₂(1–√2) + 48 Li₂(1/(1+√2)))/(48).

A few remarks on one way to arrive at an answer (details omitted here):
 • First one notices that
   ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh(x).
 • One then writes
   ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x,
and splits the integral into two pieces.
 • By making a substitution u = asinh x so that x = sinh u, one may eventually express everything in terms of ln(1+√2) (since asinh 1 = ln(1+√2)) and standard polylogarithms.
 • After much work one may show that the answer can be written as above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.3748250000 .

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (–8√2 ln³(1+√2) + 4(π²–6) ln²(1+√2) + 8√2(π²–6) ln(1+√2)
    – π²(π²–12) + 24 Li₂(1–√2) + 48 Li₂(1/(1+√2)))/(48).
