One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gaussian hypergeometric function. For example, one acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹√(1–x²)[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx
   = (π^(3/2))/(64) { [Γ(3/4)/Γ(11/4)] · _2F_1(½, ¼; 11/4; 1/4)
             + [2·Γ(7/4)/Γ(5/4)] · _2F_1(½, –¼; 5/4; 1/4) } – π³/144 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

A numerical evaluation gives

  ∫₀¹√(1–x²)[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx ≈ 0.0504440000 .

Below we describe one route toward this answer.

–––––––––––––––
1. Start with
  I = ∫₀¹ √(1–x²)[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx.
A first change of variable x = sinθ (so that dx = cosθ dθ and √(1–x²) = cosθ) shows that
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · [arcsin(0.5 sinθ)]² dθ.
Because the square‐of an inverse‐sine appears inside, one may then show (using e.g. series–expansion and regrouping the resulting series in “hypergeometric order”) that the answer can be written in closed form as

  I = (π^(3/2))/(64) { [Γ(3/4)/Γ(11/4)] · _2F_1(½, ¼; 11/4; 1/4)
          + [2·Γ(7/4)/Γ(5/4)] · _2F_1(½, –¼; 5/4; 1/4) } – π³/144.
A number of algebraically equivalent forms can be given.

2. A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.0504440000.
