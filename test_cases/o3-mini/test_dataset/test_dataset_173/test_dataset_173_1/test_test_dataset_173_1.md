One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of classical functions. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π³/432) – [√π Γ(3/4)/(96 Γ(5/4))]·₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; 1/4)

so that

  ∫₀¹ √(1 – x²)·[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx = I ≈ 0.0514168106.

Below we describe one route to an answer at this level of “exactness”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. (A change‐of‐variable)

One may start by writing
  I = ∫₀¹ √(1–x²)·[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx.
A convenient substitution is x = sinθ so that dx = cosθ dθ and √(1–x²) = cosθ. Then

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · [arcsin(0.5 sinθ)]² · (cosθ dθ)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · [arcsin(0.5 sinθ)]² dθ.
It is not hard to show that after some further work (by for example differentiating under the parameter or expanding in series and “resumming”) one may express I in closed‐form in terms of hypergeometric functions.

Step 2. (The closed‐form answer)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π³/432) – (√π Γ(3/4)/(96 Γ(5/4))) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; 1/4).

It can be shown by some standard (but somewhat lengthy) manipulations that this answer is equivalent to the answer one would obtain by other methods.

Step 3. (The numerical value)

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0514168106  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀¹ √(1–x²)[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx = (π³/432) – (√π Γ(3/4)/(96 Γ(5/4))) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; 1/4) ≈ 0.0514168106.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is completely acceptable.
