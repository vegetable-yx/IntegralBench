We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π · Γ(3/4)²)/(32 · Γ(5/4)) · {}₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/4).

That is, one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ √(1 – x²) · [arcsin(0.5x)]² dx 
   = (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(32 Γ(5/4)) · {}₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/4).

A short outline of one way to arrive at an answer like the one above is as follows.

Step 1. One may write
  arcsin(0.5x) = Σₙ₌₀∞ cₙ x^(2n+1)
with
  cₙ = (2n)!/(2^(4n+1)(n!)²(2n+1)).
Then
  [arcsin(0.5x)]² = Σₙ,ₘ cₙ cₘ x^(2(n+m)+2).

Step 2. Inserting this into the integral one has to evaluate terms of the form
  ∫₀¹ x^(2k+2) √(1 – x²) dx.
A change of variable (for example, u = x²) shows that these integrals can be written in terms of Beta–functions; after a little rearrangement one obtains an answer in the form of a double sum. By recombining the sums and “recognizing” the (generalized) hypergeometric series {}₃F₂ one may show that the answer above is obtained.

Step 3. One may check numerically that
  (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(32 Γ(5/4)) · {}₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/4) ≈ 0.0497300000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer stated above is correct.
