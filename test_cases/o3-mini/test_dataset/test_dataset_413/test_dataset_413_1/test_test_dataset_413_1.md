We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2√506) √(2024 – x²) dx.

Step 1. Recognize the integrand's form:
Note that
  2024 = 4·506  and  (2√506)² = 4·506.
Thus, writing a = 2√506 we have
  I = ∫₀ᵃ √(a² – x²) dx.

Step 2. Use the standard antiderivative:
A known antiderivative is
  ∫ √(a² – x²) dx = (x/2)√(a² – x²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(x/a) + C.
Evaluating from 0 to a:

At x = a:
  (x/2)√(a² – x²) becomes (a/2)√(a² – a²) = (a/2)·0 = 0,
  and sin⁻¹(x/a) = sin⁻¹(1) = π/2.
Thus, the upper limit gives:
  (0) + (a²/2)(π/2) = (a² π)/4.

At x = 0:
  Both terms are 0 (since √(a²) is a and sin⁻¹0 = 0).

Therefore,
  I = (a² π)/4.

Step 3. Substitute back a = 2√506:
Since a² = (2√506)² = 4·506 = 2024, we have
  I = (2024 π)/4 = 506π.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
Using π ≈ 3.141592653589793, we find
  506π ≈ 506 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ 1589.6458827164.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical value is 1589.6458827164.
