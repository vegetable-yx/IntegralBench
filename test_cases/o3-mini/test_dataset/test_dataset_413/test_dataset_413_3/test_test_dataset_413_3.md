We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2√506) √(2024 – x²) dx.

Step 1. Notice that 2024 can be written as (2√506)² since
  (2√506)² = 4·506 = 2024.
Thus, we set
  a = 2√506,
and our integral becomes
  I = ∫₀ᵃ √(a² – x²) dx.

Step 2. There is a standard formula for the integral
  ∫ √(a² – x²) dx = (x/2)√(a² – x²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(x/a) + C.
Evaluating from 0 to a yields
  I = [(a/2)√(a²–a²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(1)] – [0 + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(0)]
    = [0 + (a²/2)(π/2)] – 0
    = (a²π)/4.

Step 3. Substitute back a = 2√506:
  a² = (2√506)² = 4·506 = 2024.
Thus,
  I = (2024π)/4 = 506π.

Step 4. For the numerical approximation, compute:
  506π ≈ 506 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ 1589.6458827164,
rounded to 10 decimal places.
