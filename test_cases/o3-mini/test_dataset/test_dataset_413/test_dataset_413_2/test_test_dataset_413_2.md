We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2√506) √(2024 − x²) dx.

Observe that 2024 = 4·506 so that √2024 = 2√506. In other words, if we set
  a = 2√506,
the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^a √(a² − x²) dx.

A standard antiderivative for √(a² − x²) is
  ∫ √(a² − x²) dx = (x/2) √(a² − x²) + (a²/2) sin⁻¹(x/a) + C.

Evaluating from 0 to x = a:
• At x = a we have √(a² − a²) = 0 and sin⁻¹(a/a) = sin⁻¹(1) = π/2.
• At x = 0 we have the entire expression equal to 0.

Thus,
  I = [ (a/2)·0 + (a²/2)(π/2) ] − 0
     = (a² π)/4.

Since a = 2√506, we have a² = (2√506)² = 4·506 = 2024. Therefore,
  I = (2024 π)/4 = 506 π.

For a numerical approximation, using π ≈ 3.141592653589793 we get:
  506 · π ≈ 506 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ 1589.6458827165.

Thus, the final results are:

Exact answer: 506π  
Numerical approximation (to 10 decimal places): 1589.6458827165
