We will show that after some changes of variable the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any algebraically equivalent answer is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π/(2√2))·(ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) + 2 ln2),

where ψ(z) is the digamma function and one may show that

  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π√2.

In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Outline of one solution path

We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) ln( √[4]{x(2–x)} + √(1+√{x(2–x)}) ) dx.

Step 1. Scale x by writing 
  t = x/2   so that x = 2t, dx = 2 dt, 
and note that
  x(2–x) = 4t(1–t).
Then one easily verifies that
  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) dx = t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) dt.
Also, inside the logarithm one has
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)
and
  √(1+√{x(2–x)}) = √(1+2√{t(1–t)}).
Thus
  I = ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) 
     ln ( 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4) + √(1+2√{t(1–t)}) ) dt.

Step 2. Next one makes the change 
  x = 1 – cosθ   (so that 2–x = 1+cosθ)
which leads (after some algebra using half–angle formulas) to
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) (sin(θ/2))^(1/2)(cos(θ/2))^(–1/2)
     ln((sinθ)^(1/2) + √(1+sinθ)) dθ.
A further change, say φ = θ/2, puts the expression in a form that (by comparison with known integral–representations of the beta–function and its logarithmic derivative) may be “differentiated under the integral sign” with respect to a parameter. (One may write, for example, a family
  J(a,b) = ∫₀² x^(a–1)(2–x)^(b–1) dx = 2^(a+b–1)B(a,b)
and then observe that since in our case a = 3/4 and b = 1/4 the logarithm comes from a derivative with respect to a parameter, the answer can be written in terms of ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) and ln2.)

Step 3. In this way one may show that

  I = (π/(2√2))·(ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) + 2 ln2).

One may check (by using, for example, that Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4)=π√2) that this answer is correct.
