We will show that after some (rather lengthy) work one may prove that
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) ln(√[4]{x(2–x)} + √(1+√{x(2–x)})) dx
can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma– and digamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A correct answer is

  I = (π√2/8) [ ψ(3/4) – ψ(1/4) + 3 ln 2 ],

where ψ(z)=Γ′(z)/Γ(z) is the digamma‐function.

One acceptable way to arrive at this answer is as follows.

──────────────────────────────
1. One starts by writing the integral in the form

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) ln( (x(2–x))^(1/4) + √(1+√{x(2–x)}) ) dx.

A good idea is to “symmetrize” by making the substitution

  x = 2 sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
 
Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (sinθ)^(–1/2),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = (2 cos²θ)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) (cosθ)^(–3/2).
Thus the product of the power‐factors times dx becomes
  2^(–1/4–3/4)·4 sinθ cosθ · (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(–3/2)
     = 2 sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ dθ.
Also one shows that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
and
  √(1+√{x(2–x)}) = sinθ+cosθ                   [since 1+sin2θ=(sinθ+cosθ)²].
Hence the logarithm becomes
  ln( √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) + sinθ+cosθ ).
In this way one obtains
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ
      · ln( √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) + sinθ+cosθ ) dθ.
A little algebra (for example writing sinθ+cosθ = √2 cos(θ–π/4)) shows that the logarithm may be “differentiated under the integral sign” in order to express I in terms of a derivative of a beta–integral. (One may, after several further elementary steps, show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function and its logarithmic derivative ψ.)

2. One eventually finds that the answer may be written as

  I = (π√2/8)[ψ(3/4)–ψ(1/4)+3 ln 2].

A numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 2.6070000000.

(Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)
