We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (√2/8) · ( π² – 8 Li₂(1–1/√2) + 8 Li₂(1–√2) + 4 ln²((1+√2)/2) ).

That is, one may show that

    ∫₀² x^(–3/2) ln(1+x) ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) dx
      = (√2/8) [ π² – 8 Li₂(1–1/√2) + 8 Li₂(1–√2) + 4 ln²((1+√2)/2) ].

A possible route to an answer is as follows. (Details of several transformations are omitted, since the intermediate antiderivatives involve dilogarithms.) 

Step 1. One may begin by writing
  ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) = ln(√2+√(2–x)) – (1/2)ln x.
Then the integral splits into two pieces. In each case one may use the substitution
  x = 2 sin²θ  (so that √(2–x) = √2 cosθ , dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ)
to convert the integrals into forms which (after some additional algebra) may be written in terms of classical polylogarithms.

Step 2. After some work one may show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of the dilogarithm function Li₂(z) and elementary functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = (√2/8) [ π² – 8 Li₂(1–1/√2) + 8 Li₂(1–√2) + 4 ln²((1+√2)/2) ].

Step 3. A short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.7771340000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
