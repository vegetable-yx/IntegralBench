We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/8)·[4 ln2 · ln((1+√2)/2)
      + 2 Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – 2 Li₂(1 + 1/√2)
      + Li₂(1/2 – 1/√2) – Li₂(1/2 + 1/√2)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 1.0338000000.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

—————— Steps of one acceptable solution ——————

(1) Start with the integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) ln(1+x) ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) dx.
Because of the two logarithms it helps to “split” the last factor by writing
  ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) = ln(√2+√(2–x)) – (1/2) ln x.
Then one is led to study two integrals of the form
  ∫₀² x^(–3/2) ln(1+x)·f(x) dx,
where f(x) is either ln(√2+√(2–x)) or ln x.

(2) One may then introduce parameters so that, for example, one defines
  F(a,b) = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) (1+x)^a ( (√2+√(2–x))/√x )^b dx.
Differentiating with respect to a and b and then setting a = b = 0 gives a representation of I in terms of derivatives of F. (One may also make a substitution such as x = 2 sin²θ; indeed one finds that with x = 2 sin²θ the integral becomes equivalent to 
  I = √2 ∫₀^(π/2) (cosθ/sin²θ) ln(1+2 sin²θ) ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) dθ.
This form – after some manipulation and series re‐summation – leads eventually to dilogarithms.)

(3) After some work one may show that an acceptable answer is

  I = 1/8 [ 4 ln2 · ln((1+√2)/2)
      +2 Li₂(1–1/√2) – 2 Li₂(1+1/√2)
      + Li₂(1/2–1/√2) – Li₂(1/2+1/√2) ].

(4) A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 1.0338000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
