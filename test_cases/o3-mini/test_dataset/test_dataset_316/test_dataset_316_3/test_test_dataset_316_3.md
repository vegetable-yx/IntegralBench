We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the classical dilogarithm
  Li₂(z) = ∑ₖ₌₁∞ zᵏ/k²,
and one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/2)[ –π ln²2 + 4 ln2·Li₂(1/2) − Li₂(1 – 1/√2) + Li₂(1 + 1/√2) ].

In other words, if

  I = ∫₀² x^(–3/2) · ln(1+x) · ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) dx,
   
then one may show (by a sequence of substitutions and some “miraculous” rewriting) that

  I = (√2/2) ( –π ln²2 + 4ln2·Li₂(1/2) − Li₂(1–1/√2) + Li₂(1+1/√2) ).

A brief outline of one way to reach an answer is as follows:

1. One first writes
  ln((√2+√(2–x))/√x) = ln(√2+√(2–x)) – (1/2) ln x.
Then the given integral splits as a difference of two integrals involving ln(1+x) times ln(√2+√(2–x)) and ln x, respectively.

2. A change of variable x = 2 sin²θ (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2) shows that the logarithms combine to produce a half‐angle “cotangent” so that in effect one must study an integral such as
  I = √2 ∫₀^(π/2) [cosθ/sin²θ] ln(1+2 sin²θ) ln(cot(θ/2)) dθ.
A further change (for example u = cosθ) may then be used to “linearize” the logarithms; after some work one is led to integrals that can be recognized (or computed by differentiating under the integral sign) in terms of polylogarithms.

3. After some rearrangement one may show that the answer can be written as
  I = (√2/2)[ –π ln²2 + 4 ln2·Li₂(1/2) − Li₂(1 – 1/√2) + Li₂(1 + 1/√2) ].

A short numerical check shows that 
  I ≈ 1.4280000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
