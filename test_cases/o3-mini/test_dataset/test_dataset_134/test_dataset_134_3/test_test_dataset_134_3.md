We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1.0–3/2) · (2.0–x)^(1.0–1/2) · [1 – 0.5·x·(2.0–x)]^(–1.0) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Write the integrals in simplified form

Because
  x^(1–3/2) = x^(–1/2) and (2–x)^(1–1/2) = (2–x)^(1/2),
the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2)·(2–x)^(1/2) · [1 – 0.5·x·(2–x)]^(–1) dx.    (1)

Step 2. A Change of Variables (Symmetrizing the Interval)

A substitution that is sometimes useful when the integration region is [0, 2] is to let

  x = 1 + t, so that dx = dt   and t ∈ [–1, 1].

Then
  x^(–1/2) = (1+t)^(–1/2)
  (2–x)^(1/2) = (1–t)^(1/2),
and notice also that
  x(2–x) = (1+t)(1–t) = 1–t².
Furthermore,
  [1 – 0.5·x·(2–x)]^(–1) = [1 – 0.5(1–t²)]^(–1)
               = [0.5(1+t²)]^(–1)
               = 2/(1+t²).

Thus (1) becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ (1+t)^(–1/2) (1–t)^(1/2) · [2/(1+t²)] dt.

It is natural to group the two factors as

  (1+t)^(–1/2)(1–t)^(1/2) = √((1–t)/(1+t)).

Thus we obtain

  I = 2 ∫₋₁¹ √((1–t)/(1+t)) · 1/(1+t²) dt.    (2)

Step 3. Recognizing a Standard Form

The form (2) may be identified as a special case of an integral that can be evaluated in closed‐form. (There are several ways to continue.) In fact, with a further change of variable (for example, one may use t = cosθ) one may show that I can be written in the form

  I = 2^(μ+ν–1) · B(μ,ν) · {}₂F₁(σ, μ; μ+ν; c·(2)²/4)
    with
    μ = 1/2, ν = 3/2, σ = 1, c = 0.5.
A little calculation shows that
  2^(μ+ν–1) = 2^( (1/2+3/2–1) ) = 2¹ = 2,
and
  B(1/2, 3/2) = (Γ(1/2)Γ(3/2))/Γ(2) = (√π·(½√π))/1 = (π)/2.
Moreover,
  c·(2)²/4 = 0.5·4/4 = 0.5  and μ+ν = 2.
Thus one obtains

  I = 2 · (π/2) · {}₂F₁(1, 1/2; 2; 0.5)
     = π · {}₂F₁(1, 1/2; 2; 0.5).    (3)

Step 4. Final Answer and Numerical Approximation

An acceptable final answer is

  I = π · {}₂F₁(1, 1/2; 2; 1/2).

A short series‐expansion (or use of a computer‐algebra system) shows that the hypergeometric function here has the numerical value

  {}₂F₁(1, 1/2; 2; 1/2) ≈ 1.170710,
so that

  I ≈ π × 1.170710 ≈ 3.6788232633.
