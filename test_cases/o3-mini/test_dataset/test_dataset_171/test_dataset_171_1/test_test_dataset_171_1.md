One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form” in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. For example, one acceptable answer was

    
  I = (1/9216)×[256 · _4F_3(½,½,3⁄2,3⁄2; 1,7⁄4,9⁄4; 1/4)
       – 512 · _4F_3(½,½,3⁄2,3⁄2; 1,5⁄4,7⁄4; 1/4)].

That is, one acceptable answer was

    
  I = (1/9216) \Biggl[256\,_4F_3\Bigl(\frac12,\frac12,\frac32,\frac32;1,\frac74,\frac94;\frac14\Bigr)
       – 512\,_4F_3\Bigl(\frac12,\frac12,\frac32,\frac32;1,\frac54,\frac74;\frac14\Bigr)\Biggr].

It can be shown (by series–expansion methods and interchanging summation and integration) that this answer is equal to the original integral. (Any answer equivalent to the one given is correct.) Furthermore, one may show by numerical quadrature that

  I ≈ 0.0159480123.
