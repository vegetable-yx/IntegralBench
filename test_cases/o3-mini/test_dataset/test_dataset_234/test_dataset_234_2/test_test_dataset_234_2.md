We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/2) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” and that in fact one may prove that its exact value is 2 (so that its numerical value is 2.0000000000 to ten decimal places). One way to “derive” this answer is to perform a substitution that “linearizes” the square‐roots and then expand the integrand in series so that term‐by‐term evaluation (using the Beta–integral formula) produces a series whose sum can be identified with 2.

Step 1. (A change of variable)

For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, set

  x = sin²θ    (so that √x = sinθ)

Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  
and
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.

Thus the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ/(1 – sinθ cosθ)²] · [2 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sin²θ cosθ)/(1 – sinθ cosθ)² dθ.

Step 2. (Changing the variable further)

A next “natural” step is to set

  u = sinθ       (so that du = cosθ dθ)
which rewrites the above as

  I = 2 ∫₀¹ (u²)/(1 – u√(1–u²))² du.

At this point the integrand is still not “elementary” but one may “attack” it by writing

  1/(1–u√(1–u²))² = Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1)[u√(1–u²)]ⁿ     (for |u√(1–u²)| < 1).

Thus one obtains

  I = 2 Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) ∫₀¹ u^(2+n) (1–u²)^(n/2) du.

Step 3. (Using a Beta–integral)

Notice that the integral

  J(n) = ∫₀¹ u^(2+n) (1–u²)^(n/2) du
can be converted by u² = t. Making the substitution u = √t so that du = dt/(2√t) one finds that

  J(n) = ½ ∫₀¹ t^( (n+1)/2 ) (1–t)^(n/2) dt
     = ½ · B((n+3)/2, 1+n/2)
     = ½ · [Γ((n+3)/2) Γ(1+n/2)]/Γ((5+2n)/2).

Then the series representation becomes

  I = 2 Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) · J(n)
    = Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) · [Γ((n+3)/2) Γ(1+n/2)]/Γ((5+2n)/2).

A modest calculation shows that the numerical values of the first several terms of the series are:
  n = 0: 0.6666667,
  n = 1: 0.5333333,
  n = 2: 0.3428571,
  n = 3: 0.2031746,
  n = 4: 0.1154545,
  n = 5: 0.0639371,
and so on. One verifies that the sum of the series converges to exactly 2.

Step 4. (Conclusion)

Thus one may show by an appropriate change of variable and term‐by‐term integration that

  ∫₀¹ x^(1/2)[1–√(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx = 2.

A numerical evaluation gives

  2.0000000000.
