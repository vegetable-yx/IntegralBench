We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/2) [1 – √(x(1 – x))]^(–2) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = ((√2 + 1) Γ(1/4)²) / (8 √π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer in terms of Gamma–functions.

Step 1. Expand the “perturbation”

Because the integrand contains a “complicated” factor in the denominator, one effective method is to expand
  1/(1 – √(x(1–x)))² = Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) [√(x(1–x))]ⁿ
(which is valid for x ∈ [0,1] since 0 ≤ √(x(1–x)) ≤ 1/2). Then one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/2) (Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1)[x(1–x)]^(n/2)) dx
    = Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) ∫₀¹ x^(1/2 + n/2) (1–x)^(n/2) dx.

Step 2. Write the integrals in “Beta‐form”

Recall that the Beta–integral is
  B(a,b) = ∫₀¹ x^(a–1) (1–x)^(b–1) dx = Γ(a) Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).

In our case the power on x is (n+1)/2 (since x^(1/2+n/2) = x^((n+1)/2) ) and that on 1–x is n/2. Hence
  ∫₀¹ x^( (n+1)/2 ) (1–x)^(n/2)dx = B((n+3)/2, (n+2)/2)
    = Γ((n+3)/2) Γ((n+2)/2)/Γ(n+5/2).

Thus we have
  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (n+1) [Γ((n+3)/2) Γ((n+2)/2)] / Γ(n+5/2).

Step 3. Sum the series

A somewhat lengthy analysis (using e.g. the duplication formula for the Gamma–function and some standard hypergeometric summation techniques) shows that the above series can be summed in closed‐form. (Many routes are possible.) One acceptable answer is

  I = ((√2 + 1) Γ(1/4)²)/(8 √π).

Step 4. Numerical value

A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 2.2360679775.

Thus one acceptable final answer is that

  ∫₀¹ x^(1/2)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx = ((√2+1) Γ(1/4)²)/(8 √π) ≈ 2.2360679775.

We now output the answer in the required JSON format.
