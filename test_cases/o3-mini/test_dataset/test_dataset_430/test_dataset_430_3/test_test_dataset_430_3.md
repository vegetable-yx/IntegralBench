We start by writing the integral as
  I = ∫₀¹ ⎣log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⎦ dx.
Because 2023 > 1, when x runs from 0 to 1 the logarithm log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x is negative. For any integer n the floor function takes the value n on the set where
  n ≤ log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x < n + 1.
Exponentiating (with the base 2023) gives
  2023ⁿ ≤ x < 2023^(n+1).

Since x ∈ (0,1], we note that for n = 0 the interval is [1,2023) and only the right endpoint 1 is relevant (but of zero measure). Thus, the contributions come from n = –1, –2, –3, …, so that

  I = Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) ∫₍₂₀₂₃ⁿ₎^(₂₀₂₃^(n+1)) n dx.

On each such interval the integrand is constant; hence
  I = Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · (2023^(n+1) – 2023ⁿ)
    = Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ (2023 – 1)
    = (2023 – 1) · Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ.

To simplify the series, change the index by letting m = –n, so that m = 1, 2, 3, … and n = –m. Then
  Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ = Σₘ₌₁∞ (–m) · 2023^(–m)
    = –Σₘ₌₁∞ m/2023ᵐ.

The series Σₘ₌₁∞ m xᵐ for |x| < 1 is known to sum to x/(1 – x)². Here x = 1/2023 so that
  Σₘ₌₁∞ m/2023ᵐ = (1/2023)/(1 – 1/2023)².

Compute the denominator:
  1 – 1/2023 = (2023 – 1)/2023 = 2022/2023,
so that
  (1 – 1/2023)² = (2022²)/(2023²).

Thus,
  Σₘ₌₁∞ m/2023ᵐ = (1/2023) · (2023²/2022²) = 2023/2022².

Returning to the original series:
  Σₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ = –(2023/2022²).

Then the integral becomes
  I = (2023 – 1) · [–(2023/2022²)]
    = (2022) · [–(2023/2022²)]
    = –2023/2022.

Thus the exact answer is
  I = –2023/2022, i.e., in LaTeX: –\frac{2023}{2022}.

To provide a numerical approximation, note that
  2023/2022 = 1 + 1/2022.
Since 1/2022 ≈ 0.0004945545, we have
  I ≈ –1.0004945545
rounded to 10 decimal places.
