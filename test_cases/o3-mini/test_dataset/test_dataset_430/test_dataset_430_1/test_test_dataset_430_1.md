We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀¹ ⌊log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⌋ dx.

Step 1. Expressing the integrand in pieces

For a given real number x ∈ (0, 1], note that log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x is negative. Write k = ⌊log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⌋. For any negative integer k = –n (with n a positive integer) the condition
  –n ≤ log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x < –n + 1
is equivalent to
  2023^(–n) ≤ x < 2023^(–n+1).

Thus, the integration interval [0, 1] is partitioned into the disjoint intervals
  x ∈ [2023^(–n), 2023^(–n+1)), for n = 1, 2, 3, … 
and for x in the n‑th interval we have ⌊log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⌋ = –n.

Step 2. Converting the integral into a sum

We write the integral as the sum
  I = Σₙ₌₁^∞ ∫₍₂₀₂₃^(–n)₎^(₂₀₂₃^(–n+1)) (–n) dx.

Since the integrand is constant on each interval, the n‑th term is
  (–n)·(2023^(–n+1) – 2023^(–n))
    = (–n)·2023^(–n)[2023 – 1].
Thus the integral becomes
  I = – (2023 – 1) Σₙ₌₁^∞ n · 2023^(–n).

Step 3. Evaluating the series

We need to evaluate S = Σₙ₌₁^∞ n qⁿ with q = 1/2023. A standard formula gives
  Σₙ₌₁^∞ n qⁿ = q/(1 – q)².
Substitute q = 1/2023:
  S = (1/2023) / (1 – 1/2023)² = (1/2023) / (2022/2023)² 
    = (1/2023) · (2023²/2022²) = 2023/2022².

Thus the integral is
  I = – (2023 – 1) · (2023/2022²).

Notice that 2023 – 1 = 2022 so that
  I = – (2022·2023)/2022² = –2023/2022.

Step 4. Numerical approximation

We have
  2023/2022 = 1 + 1/2022.
Since 1/2022 ≈ 0.0004945541, it follows that
  2023/2022 ≈ 1.0004945541,
and therefore
  I ≈ –1.0004945541 (to 10 decimal places).
