We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ ⌊log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⌋ dx.

Step 1. Understand the function.
 For any real number x in (0,1), log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x is negative (since 2023 > 1) and its floor gives an integer. In fact, note that for an integer n the equality
  n ≤ log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x < n + 1
is equivalent to
  2023ⁿ ≤ x < 2023^(n+1).

Since x is in [0,1] and 2023⁰ = 1, the only intervals that fall in [0,1] occur for n ≤ –1.

Step 2. Partition the integral.
For each integer n ≤ –1, on the interval
  x ∈ [2023ⁿ, 2023^(n+1))
we have ⌊log₍₂₀₂₃₎ x⌋ = n. Thus,
  I = ∑ₙ₌₋∞^(–1) ∫₍₂₀₂₃ⁿ₎^(₂₀₂₃^(n+1)) n dx.
Since n is constant on the corresponding interval,
  I = ∑ₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n [2023^(n+1) – 2023ⁿ].

Factor 2023ⁿ out:
  2023^(n+1) – 2023ⁿ = 2023ⁿ (2023 – 1),
and so
  I = (2023 – 1) ∑ₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ.

Step 3. Change the index.
Let m = –n. Then as n runs from –∞ to –1, m runs from 1 to ∞, and n = –m. Also,
  2023ⁿ = 2023^(–m) = 1/2023ᵐ.
Thus, the sum becomes:
  ∑ₙ₌₋∞^(–1) n · 2023ⁿ = ∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) (–m) (1/2023ᵐ) = –∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) m/2023ᵐ.

So now,
  I = –(2023 – 1) ∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) m (1/2023)ᵐ.

Step 4. Evaluate the sum.
Recall that for |r| < 1 the series
  ∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) m rᵐ = r/(1 – r)².
Here r = 1/2023, so
  ∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) m (1/2023)ᵐ = (1/2023) / (1 – 1/2023)².
Since
  1 – 1/2023 = (2023 – 1)/2023,
we have
  (1 – 1/2023)² = (2023 – 1)²/2023².
Thus,
  ∑ₘ₌₁^(∞) m (1/2023)ᵐ = (1/2023) / ((2023 – 1)²/2023²) = 2023/ (2023 – 1)².

Step 5. Combine the results.
Insert the sum back into the expression for I:
  I = –(2023 – 1) · [2023/(2023 – 1)²] = –2023/(2023 – 1).

Since 2023 – 1 = 2022, the final answer is
  I = –2023/2022.

Step 6. Numerical approximation.
We have
  I = –2023/2022 = –(1 + 1/2022).
Since 1/2022 ≈ 0.0004945545, it follows that
  I ≈ –1.0004945545  (to 10 decimal places).
