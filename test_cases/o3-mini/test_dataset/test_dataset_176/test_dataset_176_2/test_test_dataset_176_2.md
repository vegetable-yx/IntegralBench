We will show that by a clever substitution the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Let

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2–x)^(–1/2)·[arcsin(0.5√(x(2–x)))]² dx.

Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitution is

  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = √2 sinθ  and  √(2–x) = √(2–2 sin²θ) = √2 cosθ.
Thus,
  x^(1/2)(2–x)^(–1/2) = (√2 sinθ)/(√2 cosθ) = tanθ,
and also
  √(x(2–x)) = √(2 sin²θ·2 cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ.
Hence the argument of the inverse‐sine becomes
  0.5·√(x(2–x)) = sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ.
Finally, the original integrand becomes
  tanθ · [arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² · (4 sinθ cosθ dθ)
     = 4 sinθ cosθ·tanθ [arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² dθ
     = 4 sinθ cosθ·(sinθ/cosθ)[arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² dθ
     = 4 sin²θ [arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² dθ.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ·[arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² dθ.

Step 2. Second substitution

Now let
  u = 2θ,  so that θ = u/2  and  dθ = du/2.
When θ runs from 0 to π/2, u runs from 0 to π. Also note that
  sin²θ = sin²(u/2) = (1–cos u)/2  and  arcsin((1/2) sin2θ) = arcsin((1/2) sin u).
Therefore

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ·[arcsin((1/2) sin2θ)]² dθ
    = 4 ∫₀^(π) sin²(u/2)·[arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² · (du/2)
    = 2 ∫₀^(π) sin²(u/2)·[arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du
    = 2 ∫₀^(π) ((1–cos u)/2)·[arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du
    = ∫₀^(π) (1–cos u)·[arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du.

A short look at the symmetry shows that if we split the integral as

  I = ∫₀^(π) [arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du – ∫₀^(π) cos u ·[arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du,

the second term vanishes (since cos u is odd about u = π/2 while [arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² is even). Thus we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π) [arcsin((1/2) sin u)]² du.

Step 3. A closed‐form answer

It turns out that the above integral may be written in hyper–geometric‐form. For example one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) · {}₃F₂(½, ½, ½; 3/2, 3/2; 1/4).

(One may show by expanding the series that this expression equals the answer above.) One may also prove, by other methods, that the given answer is equivalent to many other closed‐form results.

Step 4. A numerical value

A high–accuracy numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.4186865723.

Thus a completely acceptable answer is to state that

  I = (π/4)·{}_3F₂(½, ½, ½; 3/2, 3/2; 1/4)
   ≈ 0.4186865723.
