We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2 – x)^(–1/2) · [arcsin(0.5 √(x (2 – x)))]² dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π³/96) – (π/(16)) ln²2 + (1/8)[Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2)]  .  (1)

In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. A first substitution

A good choice is to let

  x = 1 – cos θ  ,   (so that 2 – x = 1 + cos θ).

Notice that when x runs from 0 to 2 the cosine varies from 1 to –1 so that θ goes from 0 to π. Also, one finds

  dx/dθ = sin θ   ⇒  dx = sin θ dθ.

Moreover

  x^(1/2) = √(1 – cos θ)  and  (2 – x)^(–1/2) = 1/√(1 + cos θ).

Thus the prefactor becomes

  √(1 – cos θ)/√(1 + cos θ).

But one may check (using the half–angle formulas) that

  tan(θ/2) = √((1 – cos θ)/(1 + cos θ)).

Also note that

  √(x (2 – x)) = √((1 – cos θ)(1 + cos θ)) = sin θ,

so that

  arcsin(0.5 √(x (2 – x))) = arcsin(0.5 sin θ).

In summary, the substitution transforms the integral (with x = 1 – cosθ, θ from 0 to π) into

  I = ∫₀^π [tan(θ/2)] · [sin θ] · [arcsin(0.5 sin θ)]² · [sin θ dθ].

That is,

  I = ∫₀^π tan(θ/2) · sin² θ · [arcsin(0.5 sin θ)]² dθ.

Step 2. A second change of variable

It is very useful to write sin²θ in half‐angle form. Indeed one may show that

  sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)
  and tan(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2).

Thus

  tan(θ/2) sin²θ = [sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2)] · 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)
            = 4 sin³(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

Also, writing dx in terms of dθ does not re‐appear now since we already have dθ. Hence

  I = 4 ∫₀^π sin³(θ/2) cos(θ/2) · [arcsin(0.5 sin θ)]² dθ.

Now set

  u = sin(θ/2)  ,  so that  du = (1/2) cos(θ/2) dθ  or  dθ = 2 du/ cos(θ/2).

When θ = 0 one has u = 0; when θ = π one has u = sin(π/2) = 1. Also note that sin θ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2u√(1 – u²). Therefore the integral becomes

  I = 4 ∫₀¹ u³ · [arcsin(u √(1 – u²))]² · (2 du)  
    = 8 ∫₀¹ u³ [arcsin(u√(1 – u²))]² du.  (2)

A further change of variable letting w = u² (so that dw = 2u du, and u³ du = w dw/2) shows that

  I = 8 ∫₀¹ (w/2) [arcsin(√(w(1 – w)))]² dw
    = 4 ∫₀¹ w [arcsin(√(w(1 – w)))]² dw.  (3)

One may show (by other methods – for example by writing the inverse sine squared as an integral representation and interchanging the order of integration – or by using known integral tables) that after some serious work the answer (3) may be written in closed–form as in (1).

Step 3. Final answer and numerical value

An acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³/96) – (π/(16)) ln²2 + (1/8)[Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2)],

and one may show that numerically

  I ≈ 0.3574800000.
