We start with the integral

  I = ∫ from –π/2 to π/2 cos(20x)·sin(25x) dx.

Step 1. Use the product-to-sum formula for sin and cos:
  sin A cos B = ½ [sin(A + B) + sin(A – B)].
Here, let A = 25x and B = 20x. Then
  cos(20x)·sin(25x) = ½ [sin(25x + 20x) + sin(25x – 20x)]
             = ½ [sin(45x) + sin(5x)].

Step 2. Rewrite the integral:
  I = ½ [∫ from –π/2 to π/2 sin(45x) dx + ∫ from –π/2 to π/2 sin(5x) dx].

Step 3. Observe that the sine function is odd (i.e. sin(–kx) = –sin(kx)). Since the limits are symmetric about 0, the integral of any odd function over [–a, a] is 0. Thus:
  ∫ from –π/2 to π/2 sin(45x) dx = 0  and  ∫ from –π/2 to π/2 sin(5x) dx = 0.

Step 4. Therefore, the total integral is:
  I = ½ (0 + 0) = 0.

Step 5. Numerical approximation:
  Numerically, 0 ≈ 0.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).
