We start with the integral

  I = ∫₋π/2^(π/2) cos(20x) sin(25x) dx.

Step 1. Express the product using a trigonometric identity:
  cos(20x) sin(25x) = ½ [sin(25x + 20x) + sin(25x − 20x)]
            = ½ [sin(45x) + sin(5x)].

Step 2. Substitute this into the integral:
  I = ½ ∫₋π/2^(π/2) [sin(45x) + sin(5x)] dx.

Step 3. Notice that both sin(45x) and sin(5x) are odd functions. The integral of an odd function over an interval symmetric about zero is zero. Therefore:
  ∫₋π/2^(π/2) sin(45x) dx = 0  and  ∫₋π/2^(π/2) sin(5x) dx = 0.
Thus,
  I = ½ × (0 + 0) = 0.

Step 4. The exact answer is 0. A numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:
  0.0000000000.
