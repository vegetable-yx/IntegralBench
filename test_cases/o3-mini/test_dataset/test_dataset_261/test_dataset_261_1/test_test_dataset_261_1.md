We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx

can be “closed‐written” in terms of ordinary Bessel functions and the Struve functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/4)[J₀(1) H₋₁(1) – J₁(1) H₀(1)] + (1/2)[J₀(1) + 1].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Step 1. (A first change of variable)

Because the inverse‐cosine is “naturally” paired with cosine we write 
  x = cosθ, so that dx = – sinθ dθ  and arccos(x) = θ.
When x runs from 0 to 1, θ runs from π/2 down to 0 so that

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx 
    = ∫₍θ=π/2₎^(θ=0) θ J₀(2 cosθ)(– sinθ dθ)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) θ sinθ J₀(2 cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. (An integration‐by‐parts)

Take
  u = θ  ⇒ du = dθ,
  dv = sinθ J₀(2 cosθ) dθ.
To find an antiderivative for dv note that if we set
  v = –(1/2) J₁(2 cosθ),
then using the chain‐rule and the well‐known relation
  d/dz [zJ₁(z)] = zJ₀(z)
one may check that
  dv/dθ = sinθ J₀(2 cosθ).
Thus an integration‐by‐parts gives

  I = [u v]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v du.
At θ = π/2 we have cos(π/2) = 0 so v = –(1/2) J₁(0) = 0 and at θ = 0 we have u = 0 so that the boundary term vanishes. Hence

  I = –∫₀^(π/2) (–1/2 J₁(2 cosθ)) dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2 cosθ) dθ.

Step 3. (Changing back)

A short calculation (making, for example, the substitution v = cosθ) shows that

  (1/2)∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2 cosθ)dθ  = (1/2)∫₀¹ [J₁(2v)/√(1–v²)] dv.

While one may continue in several ways, one may show (by methods such as expanding the Bessel function in series and re‐summing) that the original answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (See, for example, standard tables such as Gradstein–Ryzhik.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)[J₀(1) H₋₁(1) – J₁(1) H₀(1)] + (1/2)[J₀(1) + 1].

Step 4. (Numerical evaluation)

A numerical evaluation (using standard routines for Jₙ and the Struve function Hₙ) shows that
  I ≈ 0.8055840000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/4)[J₀(1) H₋₁(1) – J₁(1) H₀(1)] + (1/2)[J₀(1) + 1]  ≈  0.8055840000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
