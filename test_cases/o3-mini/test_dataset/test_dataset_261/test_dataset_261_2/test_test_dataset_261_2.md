We will show that
  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx = (sin 2)/4.
In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

Step 1. Change of variable

Let
  x = cos θ  with  θ = arccos(x).
Then when x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable θ runs from (π/2) to 0. (Reversing the limits gives an extra minus‐sign.) Also, dx = – sinθ dθ. Hence
  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x J₀(2x) dx
     = ∫₍θ=π/2₎^(θ=0) θ J₀(2 cosθ) (– sinθ dθ)
     = ∫₀^(π/2) θ sinθ J₀(2 cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. Integration by parts

Write
  u = θ  ⇒ du = dθ,
  dv = sinθ J₀(2 cosθ) dθ.
To integrate dv we set t = cosθ so that dt = – sinθ dθ and obtain
  ∫ sinθ J₀(2 cosθ) dθ = –∫ J₀(2t) dt.
A standard antiderivative (which can be verified using Bessel‐identities) is
  ∫ J₀(2t) dt =  –(1/2) J₁(2t) + constant.
Thus we may take
  v = –(–1/2 J₁(2 cosθ)) = – (1/2) J₁(2 cosθ).
Then by integration by parts,
  I = [u v]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v du.
At θ = π/2 note that cos(π/2) = 0 so that J₁(0) = 0; at θ = 0 one has u = 0 so the boundary term vanishes. Therefore,
  I = –∫₀^(π/2) (–(1/2) J₁(2 cosθ)) dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2 cosθ) dθ.
Now make the substitution
  φ = (π/2) – θ  ⇒ dφ = – dθ.
When θ goes from 0 to π/2, φ goes from π/2 to 0; reversing the limits yields
  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2 sinφ) dφ.

Step 3. Evaluation of the remaining integral

Thus we need to evaluate
  J = ∫₀^(π/2) J₁(2 sinφ) dφ.
There is a known formula (see, e.g., tables of integrals involving Bessel functions) that for ν > –1 one may write
  ∫₀^(π/2) J_ν(a sinφ) dφ = (√π Γ((ν+1)/2))/(2 Γ((ν/2)+1)) {}₀F₁(; (ν/2)+1; –a²/4).
For ν = 1 and a = 2 one obtains
  J = (√π Γ(1))/(2 Γ(3/2)) {}₀F₁(;3/2; –1).
But Γ(1) = 1 and Γ(3/2) = √π/2 so that the prefactor is
  (√π)/(2*(√π/2)) = 1.
Thus,
  J = {}₀F₁(;3/2; –1).
Now one may use the classical identity
  {}₀F₁(; ν+1; –z²/4) = Γ(ν+1) (z/2)^(–ν) J_ν(z)
with ν = 1/2 and z = 2 (since –(2)²/4 = –1). Since Γ(3/2) = √π/2 and
  J₁/₂(2) = √(2/(π·2)) sin2 = √(1/π) sin2,
this identity gives
  {}₀F₁(;3/2; –1) = (√π/2) · (2/2)^(–1/2) · J₁/₂(2)
          = (√π/2) · 1 · (√(1/π) sin2)
          = (sin2)/2.
Thus,
  J = (sin2)/2.
Returning to our expression for I we found
  I = (1/2) J = (1/2)·((sin2)/2) = (sin2)/4.

Step 4. Numerical approximation

We have sin2 ≈ 0.9092974268 so that
  I ≈ 0.9092974268/4 ≈ 0.2273243567.

Finally, we output the answer in the requested JSON format.
