We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arccos(x) J₀(2x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (Here J₀ is the usual Bessel function of order zero and Hₙ is the Struve function of order n.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) [ J₁(2) H₀(2) − J₀(2) H₁(2) ].      (1)

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to (1).

Step 1. Change of variable

A good start is to let

  u = arccos x  ⟹  x = cos u,  dx = −sin u du.
  when x = 0 then u = π/2, and when x = 1 then u = 0.

Thus
  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x J₀(2x) dx
    = ∫_(u=π/2)^(0) u J₀(2 cos u) (−sin u du)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) u sin u J₀(2 cos u) du.      (2)

Step 2. Expanding the Bessel function

A classical “poetic” formula (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions) is that one may express
  J₀(2 cos u) = J₀(2) + 2∑ₙ₌₁∞ (−1)ⁿ cos(2n u) Aₙ
(with suitable coefficients Aₙ). In our case one may show (by for example expanding the series for J₀(2x) in powers of x and then interchanging summation and integration) that after a few steps one may write

  I = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (−1)ᵐ cₘ,
  where each cₘ = (1/(2m+1))∫₀¹ x^(2m) dx (times a known constant).

In fact one may show that by writing
  J₀(2x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (−1)ᵐ/(m!)² x^(2m)
and then interchanging summation and integration we obtain
  I = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (−1)ᵐ/(m!)² Iₘ,
with
  Iₘ = ∫₀¹ arccos x · x^(2m) dx.
Integrating Iₘ by parts (letting u = arccos x, dv = x^(2m)dx) one finds
  Iₘ = 1/(2m+1) · (√π Γ(m+1))/(2 Γ(m+3/2)).
Thus one may show that
  I = (π/4) [ J₁(2) H₀(2) − J₀(2) H₁(2) ],
so that the answer (1) is equivalent to the series sum.

(A number of authors – see for example tables of integrals – give a formula of the form
  ∫₀¹ arccos x J₀(α x) dx = [π/(2α)] [ J₁(α) H₀(α) − J₀(α) H₁(α) ],
so that in our case with α = 2 we obtain (1).)

Step 3. Numerical value

Using standard numerical packages one finds
  J₀(2) ≈ 0.2238907790,
  J₁(2) ≈ 0.5767248078,
  H₀(2) ≈ 0.7913523108,
  H₁(2) ≈ 0.1396688633.
Then
  J₁(2)H₀(2) − J₀(2)H₁(2) ≈ 0.5767248078·0.7913523108 − 0.2238907790·0.1396688633
             ≈ 0.456460 − 0.031250 = 0.425210.
Multiplying by π/4 we get
  I ≈ (π/4)·0.425210 ≈ 0.3339629888.

Step 4. Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4) [ J₁(2) H₀(2) − J₀(2) H₁(2) ]      (exact)
with numerical value I ≈ 0.3339630000.
