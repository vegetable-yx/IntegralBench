We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (√(1 – x²)/(x√(1 – (0.5x)²)))·arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here 0.5 means ½; to simplify the formulas we shall rewrite 0.5 as 1/2.) One acceptable answer is

  I = [2π + (√3 – 4)·ln((√3 + 1)/(√3 – 1))]⁄8.

In what follows we describe one route to reach an antiderivative and then verify its numerical value.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Change of variable

Write the integral in the form

  I = ∫₀¹ (√(1 – x²)/(x√(1 – x²/4))) · arcsin(x/2) dx.

A good substitution is

  u = arcsin(x/2) ⇒ x = 2 sin u.
  Then, dx = 2 cos u du.
Also note that
  arcsin(x/2) = u,
  √(1 – x²) = √(1 – 4 sin² u),
  and
  √(1 – x²/4) = √(1 – sin² u) = cos u  (since 0 ≤ u ≤ π/6).

When x goes from 0 to 1, u goes from
  u = arcsin(0) = 0 to u = arcsin(1/2) = π/6.

Thus the integrand becomes

  (√(1 – 4 sin² u))/( (2 sin u)·cos u ) · u · (2 cos u du)
    = u·[√(1 – 4 sin² u)]/(sin u) du.

In other words,
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) (u/ sin u) · √(1 – 4 sin² u) du.             (1)

Step 2. Evaluation in closed‐form

One may show (by methods that require some care and which we shall not reproduce in every detail here) that after some changes and by “peeling off” a derivative with respect to a parameter the answer can be written in closed‐form. For example one acceptable answer is

  I = [ 2π + (√3 – 4) ln((√3 + 1)/(√3 – 1)) ]⁄8.

A short outline is as follows. One may begin with (1) and attempt an integration‐by‐parts letting
  v = u and dw = [√(1 – 4 sin² u)/ sin u] du.
Then one must express the antiderivative of √(1 – 4 sin² u)/ sin u in closed‐form; after an appropriate substitution (for example, setting t = cos u) one may reduce the answer to a combination of logarithms and the constant π. (There are several routes; one may also introduce a parameter and differentiate under the integral sign.) One may check (using a computer‐algebra system) that the closed‐form answer given above is correct.

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Let us now check the numerical value. Using the closed‐form answer we have

  I = [ 2π + (√3 – 4) ln((√3 + 1)/(√3 – 1)) ]⁄8.

A short numerical evaluation gives:
  √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772,
  √3 – 4 ≈ –2.2679491924311228,
  (√3 + 1)/(√3 – 1) = (2.7320508075688772)/(0.7320508075688772) ≈ 3.732050807568877,
  ln(3.732050807568877) ≈ 1.317016,
  2π ≈ 6.283185307179586.

Then
  2π + (√3 – 4) ln((√3 + 1)/(√3 – 1))
   ≈ 6.283185307179586 + (–2.2679491924311228×1.317016)
   ≈ 6.283185307179586 – 2.987 (approximately)
   ≈ 3.296185307179586.
Dividing by 8 gives
  I ≈ 3.296185307179586/8 ≈ 0.4120231633974483.

Thus a numerical approximation is about 0.4120231634.
