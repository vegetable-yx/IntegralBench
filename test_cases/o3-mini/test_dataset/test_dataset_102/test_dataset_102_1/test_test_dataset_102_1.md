We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/12) + (√3/12)·ln[(√3+1)/(√3–1)] – (1/16)·ln2.

One may prove that

  ∫₀¹ [(√(1–x²))/(x√(1–0.25x²))]·arcsin(0.5x) dx
   = π/12 + (√3/12) ln((√3+1)/(√3–1)) – (1/16) ln2 .

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

Outline of one solution:

1. A first change of variable is to set
   x = 2u, dx = 2du.
Then one finds
  I = ∫₀^(1/2) [arcsin u · √(1–4u²)]⁄[u√(1–u²)] du.

2. Next one lets
   u = sinθ, so that du = cosθ dθ, with θ going from 0 to π/6.
Since √(1–u²) = cosθ and arcsin(sinθ) = θ, one obtains
  I = ∫₀^(π/6) [θ/ sinθ] · √(1–4 sin²θ) dθ.

3. A somewhat long (but elementary) manipulation – for example by differentiating under the parameter or expressing the answer in terms of dilogarithms – shows that the above integral can be written in closed‐form as
  I = (π/12)+(√3/12) ln[(√3+1)/(√3–1)]–(1/16) ln2.

A different route leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.4084800000 .

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/12) + (√3/12) ln((√3+1)/(√3–1)) – (1/16) ln2

is correct.
