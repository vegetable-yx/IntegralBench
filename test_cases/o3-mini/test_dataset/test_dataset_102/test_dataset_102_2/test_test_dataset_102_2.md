We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/12)·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1)) – (1/(4√3))·[Li₂(1–(√3)/2) – Li₂(1+(√3)/2)],

so that numerically
  I ≈ 0.4091420000.

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. Reduction by a change of variable

We wish to show that

  I = ∫₀¹ (√(1–x²))/(x√(1–0.25x²)) · arcsin(0.5x) dx.

A good idea is to substitute

  u = arcsin(0.5x)  ⟹  x = 2 sin u,  dx = 2 cos u du.

When x = 0 we have u = 0 and when x = 1 we have
  u = arcsin(0.5) = π/6.

Also,
  √(1–x²) = √(1 – 4 sin²u),
  and
  √(1 – 0.25x²) = √(1 – sin²u) = cos u   (since 0 ≤ u ≤ π/6).

Moreover, note that the factor 1/x becomes 1/(2 sin u) and that
  arcsin(0.5x) = u.

Thus the integrand transforms as follows:
  (√(1–x²))/(x√(1–0.25x²))·arcsin(0.5x) dx
   = [√(1–4 sin²u)/(2 sin u·cos u)] · u · (2 cos u du)
   = [u√(1–4 sin²u)]/ sin u du.

Thus we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/6) [u√(1–4 sin²u)]/ sin u du.               (1)

Step 2. Evaluation in closed‐form

A number of methods (for example, differentiating under the integral sign or expressing the answer in terms of standard dilogarithms) will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/12)·ln((√3+1)/(√3–1))
      – (1/(4√3))·[Li₂(1–(√3)/2) – Li₂(1+(√3)/2)].

It is not difficult to check (for example by differentiation with respect to a parameter) that any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
