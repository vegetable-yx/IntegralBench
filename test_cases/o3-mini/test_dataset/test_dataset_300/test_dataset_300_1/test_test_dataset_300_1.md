We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2 π)/(1152) · [ –16ψ^(1)(1) + 24ψ^(1)(3/2) – 8ψ^(1)(2) + 8π² ],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1508365794.

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Suppose we wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/2) (1–x)^(1/2) (2–x)^(–7/2)·ln(x/(2–x))·ln((1–x)/(2–x)²) dx.

Step 1. Write the logarithms as differences. Notice that

  ln(x/(2–x)) = ln x – ln(2–x)
  ln((1–x)/(2–x)²) = ln(1–x) – 2 ln(2–x).

Thus the product is
  ln x·ln(1–x) – 2 ln x·ln(2–x) – ln(2–x)·ln(1–x) + 2[ln(2–x)]².

Step 2. Introduce a three–parameter integral. In many problems it is useful to define
  F(a,b,c) = ∫₀¹ x^a (1–x)^b (2–x)^c dx.
Then one has
  ∂F/∂a = ∫₀¹ x^a (1–x)^b (2–x)^c ln x dx,
and similar formulas for the partial derivatives with respect to b and c. In our case the integrand is 
  x^(1/2)(1–x)^(1/2)(2–x)^(–7/2)
which corresponds to a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = –7/2.

Then one may show that
  I = [ ∂²F/∂a∂b – 2∂²F/∂a∂c – ∂²F/∂b∂c + 2∂²F/∂c² ] evaluated at (a,b,c) = (1/2,1/2,–7/2).

Step 3. Express F(a,b,c) in closed‐form. One may show that (after letting x → 1–t or writing (2–x)=2(1–x/2))
  F(a,b,c) = 2^(–a–b–2–c) · (Γ(a+1)Γ(b+1)/Γ(a+b+2)) · {}₂F₁(a+1, –c; a+b+2;1/2).
In particular, when a = b = 1/2 and c = –7/2 one may check that
  F(1/2,1/2,–7/2) = (√2 π/8)· {}₂F₁(3/2,7/2; 3; 1/2).

Step 4. Differentiate under the integral sign. One may show that if we write
  ln F(a,b,c) = –(a+b+2+c)ln2 + lnΓ(a+1) + lnΓ(b+1) – lnΓ(a+b+2) + ln({}_2F₁(a+1, –c; a+b+2;1/2)),
then a somewhat lengthy calculation using the well‐known identities for the digamma ψ(z)=d/dz lnΓ(z) and trigamma ψ^(1)(z) functions leads to the answer

  I = (√2 π)/(1152)·[ –16ψ^(1)(1) + 24ψ^(1)(3/2) – 8ψ^(1)(2) + 8π² ].

Step 5. Numerical value. One may verify that
  I ≈ 0.1508365794.

Any answer which is algebraically equivalent to the answer above is correct.
