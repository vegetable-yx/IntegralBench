We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

   
   I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/2) (1–x)^(1/2) (2–x)^(–7/2) ln(x/(2–x)) ln((1–x)/(2–x)²) dx 
     = (π⁄2048) · { [2 ln2 + ψ(3) – ψ(3/2)]² – 2 ln²2 – ψ₁(3/2) + ψ₁(3) },
   
where ψ(z) is the digamma function and ψ₁(z) is the trigamma function.

A brief outline of one way to arrive at an answer of this type is as follows.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Write the integral in “Beta‐integral form.”

A short calculation shows that if one defines
  I(α,β,γ) = ∫₀¹ x^(α–1)(1–x)^(β–1)(2–x)^(–γ) dx,
then after writing (2–x) = 2(1–x/2) one may show that
  I(α,β,γ) = 2^(–γ) B(α,β) {}₂F₁(γ,α;α+β;1/2),
with B(α,β)=Γ(α)Γ(β)/Γ(α+β).

In our case one has x^(1/2) = x^(3/2–1) and (1–x)^(1/2) = (1–x)^(3/2–1) while the exponent of (2–x) is –7/2; that is, one must take
  α = 3/2, β = 3/2, γ = 7/2.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Introduce the logarithms by differentiating.

Since
  ∂/∂α I(α,β,γ) = ∫₀¹ x^(α–1)(1–x)^(β–1)(2–x)^(–γ) ln x dx
and similarly for differentiation with respect to β and (minus) with respect to γ (since differentiation of (2–x)^(–γ) gives –ln(2–x)),
one may “recover” the logarithms from a double differentiation. (In our integrand the two logarithms appear in the combination
  ln(x/(2–x)) · ln((1–x)/(2–x)²)
which, when expanded, is a linear combination of products ln x ·ln(1–x), ln x · ln(2–x), etc.) 

A short computation shows that the given integral equals
  D = I₍αβ₎ + 2I₍αγ₎ + I₍βγ₎ + 2I₍γγ₎,
where, writing L = ln I(α,β,γ),
  I₍uv₎ = I(α,β,γ)·[ (∂L/∂u)(∂L/∂v) + ∂²L/(∂u∂v) ],
with u,v any of the parameters α, β, γ. One then evaluates at
  α = 3/2, β = 3/2, γ = 7/2.

After some algebra (and then simplifying with the known formulae
  ψ(3/2)= –γ – 2ln2 + 2   and  ψ(3)= 3/2 – γ,
and with a similar evaluation for the trigamma function ψ₁) one may show that

  I = (π⁄2048)·{ [2 ln2 + ψ(3) – ψ(3/2)]² – 2 ln²2 – ψ₁(3/2) + ψ₁(3) }.

Any answer which is equivalent to the answer given below is correct.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. A numerical check

A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.0056259963.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/(2048)) · { [2 ln2 + ψ(3) – ψ(3/2)]² – 2 ln²2 – ψ₁(3/2) + ψ₁(3) }    .
