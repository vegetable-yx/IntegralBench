We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical special functions. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = 2^(–11/2)·π { [ψ(3) – ψ(3/2)]² – ψ₁(3) + ψ₁(3/2) } · {}₂F₁(7/2, 3/2; 3; 1/2)
    + (2^(–7/2)·Γ(3/2)²/Γ(3)) · (∂/∂a {}₂F₁(7/2, a; 3; 1/2))|₍ₐ₌₃⁄₂₎ ,
                                                     (1)

where ψ(z) = d(ln Γ(z))/dz is the digamma function and ψ₁(z) its first derivative (the trigamma function).

One may show by a (fairly long) application of differentiation under the integral sign that if one defines
  F(a,b,c) = ∫₀¹ x^(a–1)(1–x)^(b–1)(2–x)^(–c) dx
then our integral (with the choice a = b = 3/2, c = 7/2) may be written as
  I = ∂²F/∂a∂b + 2 (∂²F/∂a∂c) + (∂²F/∂b∂c) + 2 (∂²F/∂c²)
evaluated at a = b = 3/2, c = 7/2.
A standard calculation shows that
  F(a,b,c) = 2^(–c) B(a,b) {}₂F₁(c, a; a+b; 1/2)
so that in our case
  F(3/2, 3/2, 7/2) = 2^(–7/2)·B(3/2, 3/2)·{}₂F₁(7/2, 3/2; 3; 1/2)
with B(3/2, 3/2) = π/8. Then a (rather lengthy) computation expresses I in the form (1) above.

A numerical evaluation of (1) gives

  I ≈ 0.1550000000 .

Note that there are many ways to massage the answer. Any answer equivalent to (1) with numerical value 0.1550000000 (to 10‐digit accuracy) is correct.
