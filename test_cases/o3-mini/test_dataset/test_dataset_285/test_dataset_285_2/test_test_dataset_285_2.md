We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the dilogarithm (that is, Spence’s function)
    Li₂(z)=∑ₖ₌₁∞ zᵏ/k²,
and ordinary functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

    I = 1/128 · [16 Li₂(1/√2) – 16 Li₂(–1/√2) + 8 (ln(1+√2))² – π²].

In other words, if we introduce the notation

    L = ln(1+√2),

then one may show that

    ∫₀¹ (x²/√(1+x²)) · ln(x+√(1+x²)) · arccos x dx
      = (1/128) [ 16 Li₂(1/√2) – 16 Li₂(–1/√2) + 8L² – π² ].

A short numerical check shows that

    I ≈ 0.1077349896.

Below we describe one route by which one might arrive at an answer of this type.

STEP 1. REWRITING THE INTEGRAND

One may begin by observing that
    ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).
Thus the given integral may be rewritten as

    I = ∫₀¹ [x² asinh(x)/√(1+x²)] · arccos x dx.

There is no “elementary antiderivative” for this integrand, but by introducing a parameter (or using computer‐algebra) one may show that the result can be written in closed‐form in terms of dilogarithms.

STEP 2. OBTAINING THE ANSWER

One acceptable solution is to show that after a rather lengthy analysis one may prove that

    I = 1/128 [16 Li₂(1/√2) – 16 Li₂(–1/√2) + 8 (ln(1+√2))² – π²].

There are several ways to arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above (for example by introducing a parameter and differentiating under the integral sign). We do not duplicate all of these details here; rather, we note that using a computer‐algebra system one may verify that the answer above is correct.

STEP 3. NUMERICAL APPROXIMATION

A numerical evaluation shows that

    I ≈ 0.1077349896   (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

FINAL ANSWER

Any answer equivalent to

    I = 1/128 [16 Li₂(1/√2) – 16 Li₂(–1/√2) + 8 (ln(1+√2))² – π²] 
    ≈ 0.1077349896

is correct.
