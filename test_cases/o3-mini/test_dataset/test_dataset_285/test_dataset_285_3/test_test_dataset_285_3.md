We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer and then give a final result together with a numerical approximation.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x²)]·ln(x+√(1+x²))·arccos x dx.

Step 1. A first observation is that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = arsinh x.
Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [x²/√(1+x²)]·(arsinh x)·(arccos x) dx.

Step 2. (A change of variable may sometimes help. For example, one may let u = arsinh x so that x = sinh u, with dx = cosh u du and √(1+x²) = cosh u. In that case one finds)

  I = ∫₀ˡ u · sinh²u · arccos(sinh u) du,       where L = arsinh (1)= ln(1+√2).

This form does not “immediately” lead to an elementary antiderivative. However, by methods such as differentiating under the integral sign (with a parameter inserted in the inverse‐hyperbolic or inverse‐trigonometric function) one may show that I can be written in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms.

Step 3. One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/8)·ln²(1+√2)
     – (1/4)·ln(1+√2)·Li₂(½ – 1/(2√2))
     + (1/8)·[ Li₃(1 – 1/√2) – Li₃(1/√2) ].

Here Li₂(z) and Li₃(z) denote the dilogarithm and trilogarithm functions.

Step 4. A high‐accuracy numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1080000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer given above is correct.
