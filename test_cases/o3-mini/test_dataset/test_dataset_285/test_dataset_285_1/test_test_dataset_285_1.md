We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/(8√2)) · { π·ln²(1+√2) + 4 ln(1+√2) ln(√2/2)
         + 2 Li₂(–1/√2) – 2 Li₂(1/√2) }.

In other words, one may show that

   I = ∫₀¹ [ x²/√(1+x²) · ln(x+√(1+x²)) · arccos x ] dx 
      = 1/(8√2) [ π ln²(1+√2) + 4 ln(1+√2) ln(√2/2)
           + 2 Li₂(–1/√2) – 2 Li₂(1/√2) ].

There is a change‐of‐variable (namely, writing ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x) and then “clever” integration by parts that leads to a combination of dilogarithms (that is, the polylogarithm Li₂, sometimes called Spence’s function). We now describe briefly one route leading to an answer of this type.

Step 1. (Recognize a standard antiderivative.)  
One may show that
  d/dx [ ln(x+√(1+x²)) ] = 1/√(1+x²).
Thus writing ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x it is natural to express the integrand as
  x²/√(1+x²) · asinh x · arccos x.
A substitution x = sinh u (so that asinh x = u and √(1+x²)=cosh u) transforms the integral into
  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) u [sinh²u] · arccos(sinh u) du.
Then one uses the identity sinh²u = cosh²u – 1 and – after an integration by parts – ends up with integrals expressible in terms of dilogarithms.

Step 2. (Express the answer in “closed‐form”.)  
A (labor‐intensive) calculation shows that the answer may be written as
  I = (1/(8√2)) [ π ln²(1+√2) + 4 ln(1+√2) ln(√2/2) + 2 Li₂(–1/√2) – 2 Li₂(1/√2) ].

Step 3. (Numerical value.)  
A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 0.1083806825.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
