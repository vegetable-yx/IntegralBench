We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄12) · _3F_2(½,½,½; 3⁄4,5⁄4; 1⁄4)
    – [Γ(1/4)⁴⁄(96π)] .

In other words, one may prove that

    ∫₀¹ x·ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²)))·K(0.5x)dx
     = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄12)·_3F_2(½,½,½; 3⁄4,5⁄4; 1⁄4)
       – (Γ(1/4)⁴⁄(96π)) ,

where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (with k = 0.5x) and _3F_2 is a generalized hypergeometric function.

A possible way to arrive at an answer of this type is as follows.

────────────────────────────
Outline of one approach:

1. One first makes the substitution
  x = sinθ     (so that √(1–x²)=cosθ)
which shows that
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ·arctanh(cosθ)·K(0.5 sinθ)dθ.
(Notice that ln((1+cosθ)/(1–cosθ)) = 2 arctanh(cosθ).)

2. One then expresses the complete elliptic integral in its standard form
  K(0.5 sinθ) = ∫₀^(π/2)[1 – 0.25 sin²θ sin²φ]^(–1/2)dφ,
or uses its standard series expansion. Similarly one writes a series for arctanh(cosθ).

3. Interchange of summation and integration leads (after some rearrangement) to series that can be summed in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function.

4. After some algebra one may show that the answer may be written in the form

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄12)·_3F_2(½,½,½; 3⁄4,5⁄4; 1⁄4)
    – (Γ(1/4)⁴⁄(96π)) .

One may show (by using standard references for integrals involving elliptic integrals and hypergeometric functions) that the answer above is equivalent to any answer expressed in “closed‐form.”

Numerical approximation

With
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one may check that

  I ≈ 1.4454478166   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄12)·_3F_2(½,½,½; 3⁄4,5⁄4; 1⁄4) – (Γ(1/4)⁴⁄(96π))
   ≈ 1.4454478166 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
