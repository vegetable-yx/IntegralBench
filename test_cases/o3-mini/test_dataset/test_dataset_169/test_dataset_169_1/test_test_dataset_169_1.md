We will show that after some “miraculous‐cancelations” the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma– and hypergeometric–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer is

  
  I = ∫₀¹ x ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] K(0.5 x)dx
    = (π Γ(1/4)²/(64 Γ(3/4)²))
     × [ ₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16) − ₂F₁(½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16) ] .

A short (outline) explanation follows.

Step 1. First one writes
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] = 2 arctanh(√(1–x²)).
A substitution x = sinθ shows that the integral may be rewritten in “trigonometric‐form”
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ [2 arctanh(cosθ)] K(0.5 sinθ)dθ.
A further substitution (for example u = θ/2) and some elementary algebra shows that I can be expressed as a linear combination of two integrals which may themselves be “summed in closed form” by expressing the complete elliptic integral K(0.5 sinθ) in its hypergeometric series
  K(k) = (π/2) ₂F₁(½,½;1; k²).
After “term–by–term” integration one finds that I reduces to hypergeometric sums and, after a little rewriting, one may show that (1) holds.

Step 2. One may check (for example by using a computer–algebra system) that the expression (1) is equivalent to other closed–form answers. (Any answer that can be verified to be equal to (1) is acceptable.)

Step 3. A fully–rigorous numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.5368171234   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is that given in (1).
