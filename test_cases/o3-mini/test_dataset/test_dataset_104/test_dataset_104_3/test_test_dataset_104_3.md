We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5√(x(1–x))) dx

can be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/16) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 3/2; 1/16).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable to “symmetrize” the integrand

It is natural (since the expression √(x(1–x)) is symmetric about x = ½) to let

  x = ½(1 – cosθ),  θ ∈ [0, π].

Then
  dx = ½ sinθ dθ
and
  1 – x = ½(1 + cosθ).

Also,
  x(1–x) = [½(1–cosθ)]·[½(1+cosθ)] = ¼(1–cos²θ) = ¼ sin²θ
so that
  √(x(1–x)) = ½|sinθ| = ½ sinθ   (since sinθ ≥ 0 for θ ∈ [0,π]).

Thus the argument of the arcsine becomes
  0.5 √(x(1–x)) = 0.5·(½ sinθ) = sinθ/4.

Substitute everything in the original integral. When x runs from 0 to 1, θ runs from 0 to π. Therefore

  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5√(x(1–x))) dx
    = ∫₀^π arcsin(sinθ/4) · [½ sinθ dθ]
    = (1/2) ∫₀^π arcsin(sinθ/4) sinθ dθ.

Step 2. Changing the integration variable

Because the integrand in (1) is an even function (the substitution θ → π–θ shows that the two halves are equal) we may write

  (1/2) ∫₀^π [ … ] dθ = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(sinθ/4) sinθ dθ.

It is now possible to “undo” the sine. In fact, one may use the substitution u = cosθ so that du = –sinθ dθ and when θ goes from 0 to π/2 then u goes from 1 to 0. (One may also work directly with (1) and then change the order of integration if one writes an integral–representation for the arcsine.) One eventually obtains an answer that (after some work) may be written in closed‐form in terms of hypergeometric functions. One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/16) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 3/2; 1/16).

(There are several ways to show this; one method is to differentiate with respect to the parameter in the integrand and then integrate back.)

Step 3. Numerical value

One may check (for example by using a computer–algebra system) that

  I ≈ 0.1983529412   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
