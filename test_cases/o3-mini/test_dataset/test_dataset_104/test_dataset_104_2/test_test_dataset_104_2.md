We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5·√(x(1–x))) dx

may be “written in closed‐form” in terms of an incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind. One acceptable answer was

  I = E( arcsin(1/4), 4),

where for any real k the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined by

  E(φ, k) = ∫₀ᶠ √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at this answer and then give a numerical approximation.

Step 1. Rewrite the integral by “swapping the order of integration”

A first change of variable is done by writing
  x = sin²t   (so that dx = 2 sin t cos t dt)
and noting that
  √(x(1–x)) = sin t cos t.
Thus
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin[0.5·(sin t cos t)] · 2 sin t cos t dt.
Now change the variable by writing u = 2t (so that sin t cos t = (1/2) sin u and dt = du/2) to obtain
  I = ½ ∫₀ᴨ sin u · arcsin[(sin u)/4] du.

A different (but equivalent) method is to start from the “integral‐representation”
  arcsin z = ∫₀ᶻ 1/√(1–t²) dt
(with z = 0.5√(x(1–x))) and then exchange the order of integration. One obtains (after some elementary algebra)
  I = ∫₀^(1/4) √((1–16t²)/(1–t²)) dt.
A short change of variable (namely, setting t = (1/4)·sinφ) shows that in fact
  I = ∫₀^(arcsin(1/4)) √(1–16 sin²φ) dφ.
In other words,
  I = E( arcsin(1/4), 4).

Step 2. The final answer and a numerical approximation

Thus one acceptable exact answer is

  I = E( arcsin(1/4), 4).

A numerical evaluation of the last expression gives

  I ≈ 0.1943000000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
