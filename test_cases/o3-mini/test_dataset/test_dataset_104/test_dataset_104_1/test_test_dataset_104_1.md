We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ arcsin(0.5√(x(1–x))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of an incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to that answer.

Step 1. A first change of variable

A standard trick for integrals on [0,1] when the combination x(1–x) appears is to “symmetrize” the interval. Write

  x = ½ + z, so that z ∈ [–½, ½].
Then
  x(1–x) = (½+z)(½–z) = ¼ – z²,
and
  dx = dz.
By symmetry the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₋½^(½) arcsin(0.5√(¼–z²)) dz
    = 2∫₀^(½) arcsin(0.5√(¼–z²)) dz.

Step 2. A trigonometric substitution

Now set
  z = ½ sinθ, so that when z goes from 0 to ½, θ runs from 0 to π/2.
Then
  dz = ½ cosθ dθ,
and
  ¼ – z² = ¼ – ¼ sin²θ = ¼ cos²θ
so that
  0.5√(¼–z²) = 0.5 · (½ cosθ) = cosθ/4.
Thus the integral becomes

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(cosθ/4) · (½ cosθ dθ)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · arcsin(cosθ/4) dθ.

Step 3. Integration by parts

We now set
  u = arcsin(cosθ/4), dv = cosθ dθ.
Then
  du = (d/dθ)[arcsin(cosθ/4)] dθ 
    = [–(sinθ)/(4√(1 – (cosθ/4)²)] dθ,
and
  v = sinθ.
Integration by parts gives

  I = [sinθ·arcsin(cosθ/4)]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ · (–sinθ/(4√(1 – cos²θ/16)) ) dθ.
At θ = 0 one has sinθ = 0; at θ = π/2 one has cos(π/2)=0 so that arcsin(0/4)=0. Hence the boundary term vanishes and we obtain

  I = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) (sin²θ)/√(1 – cos²θ/16) dθ.

Step 4. Changing the integration variable

Write sin²θ = 1 – cos²θ and then change the variable by setting

  t = cosθ, so that dt = –sinθ dθ.
When θ runs from 0 to π/2, t runs from 1 to 0. A short (but careful) calculation shows that after rearrangement one may show that

  I = ∫₀¹ √((1 – t²)/(16 – t²)) dt.
A further substitution t = 4 sin φ (with φ running from 0 to arcsin(1/4)) then gives

  I = ∫₀^(arcsin(1/4)) √(1 – 16 sin²φ) dφ.
But by definition the (incomplete) elliptic integral of the second kind is

  E(φ, k) = ∫₀^φ √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.
Thus we may express the answer as

  I = E(arcsin(1/4), 4).

Step 5. Summary and numerical approximation

An acceptable answer is

  I = E(arcsin(1/4), 4).

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1979200000  (to 10‐decimal precision).
