We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ 1/(eˣ + 1) dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution u = e^(–x). Then,
  x = –ln u  and  dx = –du/u.
When x = 0, u = e^(0) = 1; when x → ∞, u = e^(–∞) = 0.
Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₁⁰ 1/(1 + eˣ) dx = ∫₁⁰ 1/[1 + 1/u] (–du/u).

Notice that
  1 + 1/u = (u + 1)/u,
so
  1/(1 + 1/u) = u/(u + 1).

Also, the differential factor yields:
  dx = –du/u.
Thus,
  I = ∫₁⁰ [u/(u + 1)] (–du/u)
     = ∫₁⁰ –du/(u + 1)
     = ∫₀¹ du/(u + 1)
(after reversing the limits the minus sign is removed).

Step 2. Now, compute the new integral:
  I = ∫₀¹ du/(1 + u).
This is a standard integral with antiderivative ln|1 + u|. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives:

  I = ln(1 + u) |₀¹ = ln(2) − ln(1) = ln 2.

Thus, the exact answer is ln 2.

Step 3. Numerical Approximation:
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806 (to 10 decimal places).
