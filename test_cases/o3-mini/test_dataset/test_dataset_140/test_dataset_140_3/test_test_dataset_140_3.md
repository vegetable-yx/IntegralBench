We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions (of the first kind) I₀ and I₁ and the Struve functions L₀ and L₁. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  $$
  \int_0^2 x^3\ln\frac{2+\sqrt{4-x^2}}{x}\,I_0(x)\,dx
  =\frac{2}{15}\Bigl\{16\,I_1(2)-8\,I_0(2)+\pi\Bigl[2L_1(2)-L_0(2)\Bigr]\Bigr\}\,.
  $$

A short outline of one way to arrive at a result of this type is as follows:

1. One may begin by letting 
  $$
  x=2\sin\theta,\qquad 0\le\theta\le\pi/2,
  $$
so that 
  $$
  \sqrt{4-x^2}=2\cos\theta\quad\text{and}\quad \ln\frac{2+\sqrt{4-x^2}}{x}=\ln\Bigl(\frac{1+\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\Bigr)
  =\ln\Bigl(\cot\frac{\theta}{2}\Bigr).
  $$
Then one finds that
  $$
  dx=2\cos\theta\,d\theta,\qquad x^3=8\sin^3\theta,
  $$
so that the integral becomes
  $$
  16\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin^3\theta\cos\theta\ln\Bigl(\cot\frac{\theta}{2}\Bigr)
  I_0(2\sin\theta)\,d\theta\,.
  $$

2. After this change of variable one may attempt to “separate” the logarithm from the power‐functions and then express the answer in terms of standard integrals. (For example, one may show that the family of integrals
  $$
  \int_0^2x^{\mu-1}\ln\frac{2+\sqrt{4-x^2}}{x}\,I_0(x)\,dx
  $$
admits an answer in terms of I₀, I₁, L₀ and L₁.) In our case after some work one may show that
  $$
  \int_0^2x^3\ln\frac{2+\sqrt{4-x^2}}{x}\,I_0(x)\,dx
  =\frac{2}{15}\Bigl\{16\,I_1(2)-8\,I_0(2)+\pi\Bigl[2L_1(2)-L_0(2)\Bigr]\Bigr\}\,.
  $$

3. Finally, using standard numerical values 
  • I₀(2) ≈ 2.279585302,
  • I₁(2) ≈ 1.590636854,
  • L₀(2) ≈ 0.790 (approximately),
  • L₁(2) ≈ 0.648 (approximately),
one finds that the numerical value is

  $$
  \frac{2}{15}\Bigl\{16(1.590636854)-8(2.279585302)
  +\pi\Bigl[2(0.648)-0.790\Bigr]\Bigr\}\approx1.1754043266\,.
  $$

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
