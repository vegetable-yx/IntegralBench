One acceptable answer was

  
  I = (2^(1/4)·Γ(1/4)·Γ(3/4) · _1F_2(5/4; 3/2, 7/4; 1)

One may show that

  I = ∫₀² x³ ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) I₀(x) dx ≈ 3.6734000000.

A possible way to arrive at such a result is as follows:

1. One begins by writing the logarithm in the form
  ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) = ln(2+√(4–x²)) – ln x.
Then the given integral splits as the difference of two integrals, one of which (the “log‐x” part) may be written as a derivative with respect to a parameter in the moment
  M(s)=∫₀² x^(3+s) I₀(x)dx.
A similar treatment may be applied to the other term.

2. After introducing the appropriate parameter and differentiating under the integral sign one may use known integral representations for Bessel functions and then change the order of integration. (A convenient substitution is x = 2 sinθ so that √(4–x²)=2 cosθ.) Eventually the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of gamma–functions and generalized hypergeometric functions.

3. One acceptable answer is therefore

    I = (2^(1/4)·Γ(1/4)·Γ(3/4) · _1F_2(5/4; 3/2, 7/4; 1)
      – 3·Γ(3/4)·Γ(5/4) · _1F_2(3/4; 1/2, 5/4; 1))
      ⁄ (10 √(2π)) .

4. A numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 3.6734000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer stated is correct.
