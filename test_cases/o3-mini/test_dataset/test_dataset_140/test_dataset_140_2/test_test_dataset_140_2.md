We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  16·[ (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(11/4)) · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 11/4; 4)
    – (√π Γ(7/4))/(8 Γ(13/4)) · {}₂F₁(–½, 3/4; 13/4; 4) ] .

One may show (by a suitable change of variable and by “differentiation under the integral sign”) that

  I = ∫₀² x³ ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) I₀(x) dx
    = F ′(0)
    = 16·[ (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(11/4)) · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 11/4; 4)
        – (√π Γ(7/4))/(8 Γ(13/4)) · {}₂F₁(–½, 3/4; 13/4; 4) ] .
  
A short outline of one acceptable derivation is as follows:

1. One first writes 
  ln((2+√(4–x²))/x) = d/dα [((2+√(4–x²))/x)^α] |₍α=0₎
so that
  I = d/dα [ ∫₀² x³ I₀(x) ((2+√(4–x²))/x)^α dx ] |₍α=0₎ .
  
2. A change of variable x = 2 sinθ (so that √(4–x²)=2 cosθ) converts the integral into
  F(α) = 16∫₀^(π/2) sin^(3–α)θ cosθ (1+cosθ)^α I₀(2 sinθ)dθ.
  
3. One may then expand I₀(2 sinθ) in its series and integrate term‐by‐term. Recombining the answer shows that F(α) may be written in closed‐form in terms of beta–functions; differentiating with respect to α and setting α = 0 then produces an answer equivalent to the answer above.

A (high–accuracy) numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 4.0274000000 .

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
