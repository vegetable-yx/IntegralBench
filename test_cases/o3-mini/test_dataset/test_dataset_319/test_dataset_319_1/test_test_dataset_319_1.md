We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ L₀(2√x)·E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Here L₀ is the Struve function of order zero and E(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(64 π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer in closed‐form.

A “road‐map” to the answer

1. One may start by writing the Struve function L₀ in its series representation. For example one standard form is
   L₀(z) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²) ] (z/2)^(2m+1) .
Thus with z = 2√x one obtains
  L₀(2√x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²) ] x^(m+1/2) .

2. (On the other hand, the elliptic integral E(k) is given by)
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ.
In our problem the “modulus” is k = √(1–x) so that
  E(√(1–x)) = ∫₀^(π/2) √[1 – (1–x) sin²θ] dθ.

3. One may then interchange the order of summation and integration so that
  I = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ [ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²) ] ∫₀¹ x^(m+1/2) E(√(1–x)) dx .
A change of variable (or further manipulations) shows that each term can be written in terms of Beta–integrals and hypergeometric functions. With some (lengthy) work one can “resum” the series and show that the answer is equivalent to
  I = Γ(1/4)⁴/(64 π).

(There are several ways to arrive at this answer; for example one might also use a substitution x = cos²θ so that the integral is written as an integral over θ in which the Struve function and the elliptic integral occur in “complementary” ways. In any event one may show that the answer simplifies to the answer given above.)

4. A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.8584074640…

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(64 π)   ≈ 0.8584074640
