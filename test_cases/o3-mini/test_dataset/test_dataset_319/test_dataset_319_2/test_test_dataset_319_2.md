We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀¹ L₀(2√x) E(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; ½).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

A possible solution route

(1) First make the change of variable
  x = u²  so that dx = 2u du.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ L₀(2u) E(√(1–u²)) · 2u du.

(2) Next one may use the standard series representation for the Struve function of order zero (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise or standard references):
  L₀(z) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ⁄[Γ(m+3/2)]² · (z/2)^(2m+1),  (z real).
In our case with z = 2u this becomes
  L₀(2u) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2))² · u^(2m+1).

Thus the integrand becomes
  2u · L₀(2u) E(√(1–u²))
    = 2u E(√(1–u²)) ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2))² u^(2m+1)
    = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2))² · u^(2m+2) E(√(1–u²)).
Then
  I = 2 ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2))² ∫₀¹ u^(2m+2) E(√(1–u²)) du.

(3) Next one might express the complete elliptic integral of the second kind by writing it in “hypergeometric‐form”. One standard formula is
  E(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; k²),
so that in our case
  E(√(1–u²)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; 1–u²).

Then after interchanging summation and integration the u–integrals are of beta–type and may be evaluated in closed–form. (One may also, after an obvious substitution u = sinθ, express the answer in terms of integrals of the type ∫ sin^pθ cos^qθ ₂F₁(–½,½;1;cos²θ)dθ and then use known beta–integrals.)

(4) After some rearrangement one may show that the answer can be written in the compact closed–form
  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; ½).
A number of algebraically equivalent forms can be obtained.

(5) Finally one may verify numerically that
  I ≈ 0.9021000000.
A short numerical check (for example by using a high–accuracy quadrature rule) confirms this value.

Final answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 3/4; ½)  ≈ 0.9021000000.
