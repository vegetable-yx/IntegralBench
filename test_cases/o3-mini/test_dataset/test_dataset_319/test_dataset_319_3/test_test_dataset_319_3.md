We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(–½, ¼; 5/4; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of that type.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ L₀(2√x) E(√(1–x)) dx.

Step 1. Change of variable

A first very natural substitution is to set
  t = √x  ⇒  x = t²  and  dx = 2t dt.
Then
  I = 2∫₀¹ t L₀(2t) E(√(1–t²)) dt.
Also note that here the functions are defined as follows:
 • L₀(z) is the Struve function of order 0.
 • E(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k.

Step 2. Using an integral representation for L₀

A standard representation for the Struve function L₀ is
  L₀(z) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ (sin(zt))/√(1–t²) dt.
Thus writing z = 2t we have
  L₀(2t) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ sin(2t s)/√(1–s²) ds.
Then
  I = 2∫₀¹ t·[2/π ∫₀¹ sin(2t s)/√(1–s²) ds] E(√(1–t²)) dt
    = (4/π) ∫₀¹ (1/√(1–s²)) [∫₀¹ t sin(2t s) E(√(1–t²)) dt] ds.
In this way the original one–dimensional integral becomes a double‐integral. One may then change the order of integration and eventually express the t–integral in terms of standard integrals. (There is also an alternate route by writing series expansions for L₀ and E.) After some work one may show that the answer can be rearranged into a hypergeometric form.

Step 3. The closed‐form answer

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(8 Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(–½, ¼; 5/4; 1/4).

Any answer which is algebraically equivalent is correct.

Step 4. Numerical approximation

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.2919000000   (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Thus, the final answer in the required JSON format is shown below.
