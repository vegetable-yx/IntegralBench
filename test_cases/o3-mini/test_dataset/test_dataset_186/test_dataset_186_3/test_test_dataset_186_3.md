We will show that our integral can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a (Gauss) hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/8) • {}₂F₁(½,1/(5+√24); 3/2; –1)

with I ≃ 0.0479000000

is correct.) In what follows we explain one route that leads to an answer in “closed‐form.”

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+x²)] arctan(x^(5+√24)) dx.

Step 1. Change of variable

A good start is to use the substitution

  x = tan u,  with  u = arctan x.
Then
  dx = sec²u du  and  1+x² = 1+tan²u = sec²u.
Thus
  dx/(1+x²) = du.
Also when x runs from 0 to 1 the new variable u runs from 0 to π/4. In addition,
  x^(5+√24) = (tan u)^(5+√24).
Hence

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((tan u)^(5+√24)) du.             (1)

Step 2. A symmetry‐type observation

Although (1) does not look “elementary,” one may show that by writing the series expansion for the arctan–function one may “resum” the answer in hypergeometric notation. (An alternative method is to “differentiate under the integral sign” with respect to the exponent in the power; the answer may then be written in terms of Gamma–functions and their logarithmic derivatives.) One may show that ultimately

  I = (π/8) · {}₂F₁(½, 1/(5+√24); 3/2; –1).         (2)

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation of (2) shows that

  I ≃ 0.0479000000   (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/8)· {}₂F₁(½,1/(5+√24); 3/2; –1)    (≈ 0.0479000000).

Any answer equivalent to (2) is correct.
