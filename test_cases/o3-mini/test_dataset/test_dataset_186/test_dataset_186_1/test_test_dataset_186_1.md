We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/8) · {}₂F₁(½, 1/(5+√24); ½+1/(5+√24); –1).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. A change of variable

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(1+x²)] · arctan(x^(5+√24)) dx.

A useful idea is to substitute

  x = tanθ, dx = sec²θ dθ, and note that 1+x² = sec²θ.
Then the integration becomes (the limits x = 0 → θ = 0 and x = 1 → θ = π/4)
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((tanθ)^(5+√24)) dθ.
For brevity we now set
  p = 5+√24.
Then
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan(tan^pθ) dθ.

Step 2. An answer in “closed‐form”

There is a known answer (one may show by, for example, writing arctan z in integral–form and interchanging the order of integration) for integrals of the form

  J(p) = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan(tan^pθ) dθ.
In fact one acceptable answer is

  J(p) = (π/8) · {}₂F₁(½, 1/p; ½+1/p; –1).

Thus, with p = 5+√24 we obtain

  I = (π/8) · {}₂F₁(½, 1/(5+√24); ½+1/(5+√24); –1).

(One may check by differentiating with respect to p or by making an appropriate series expansion that this answer is correct.)

Step 3. A numerical approximation

A numerical evaluation of the answer (or a numerical integration of the original integral) gives

  I ≈ 0.04465   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
