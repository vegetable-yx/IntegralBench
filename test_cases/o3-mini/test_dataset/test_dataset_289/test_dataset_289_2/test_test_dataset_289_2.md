We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x H₀(2√x) K(√(1–x)) dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (In what follows the function H₀ is the Struve function of order zero and K is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(32√(2π)).

In what follows a possible solution path is described.

A “sketch” of one way to arrive at an answer

(1) One first makes the change of variable 
  u = √x  ⇒  x = u², dx = 2u du,
so that
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ u³ H₀(2u) K(√(1–u²)) du.

(2) Next one recalls that a useful integral‐representation for the Struve function H₀ is

  H₀(z) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ √(1–t²) sin(z t) dt,  (z ∈ ℝ).

In our case z = 2u so that

  H₀(2u) = (2/π) ∫₀¹ √(1–t²) sin(2u t) dt.

Thus one may write
  I = (4/π) ∫₀¹ √(1–t²) dt ∫₀¹ u³ sin(2u t) K(√(1–u²)) du.

(3) Next one expresses K(√(1–u²)) by using the standard representation
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1–k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ.
In our case k = √(1–u²) so that
  K(√(1–u²)) = ∫₀^(π/2) [u² sin²θ + cos²θ]^(–1/2) dθ.

(4) One now interchanges the order of integration and manipulates the appearance of the sine and the powers of u so that (after some work) the u–integral may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a very-well‐poised hypergeometric sum. Then one uses known summation formulas
  {}_2F_1(a,b;c;1) = Γ(c)Γ(c–a–b)/(Γ(c–a)Γ(c–b))
(where the parameters come out so that everything “mirrors” nicely).

(5) After some algebra one obtains
  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(32√(2π)).

It turns out that, after some work, one may show that this answer is equivalent to any answer expressed in terms of other combinations of Gamma–functions.

(6) A short numerical computation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1637003749.

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(32√(2π))
  ≈ 0.1637003749
is correct.
