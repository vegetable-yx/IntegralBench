We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

    ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x · J₁(2x) dx
     = [Γ(1/4)⁴ – (25/2) Γ(3/4)⁴]⁄[64√(2π)] .

A numerical evaluation shows that the value is approximately

    0.8973239999…

A short outline of one way to arrive at an answer is as follows:

1. Write the Bessel function in its series‐form
  J₁(2x) = Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ⁄[m!(m+1)!] · x^(2m+1) .
Then one may write
  I = ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x · J₁(2x) dx
   = Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ⁄[m!(m+1)!] ∫₀¹ x^(2m) arccos x dx .

2. In the inner integral one uses integration by parts and then makes the substitution x = sinθ so that
  ∫₀¹ x^(2m)arccos x dx = (√π⁄[2(2m+1)]) · [Γ(m+1)⁄Γ(m+3/2)] .
In this way one obtains
  I = (√π/2) · Σₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ⁄[(m+1)!(2m+1)Γ(m+3/2)] .

One may then “recognize” (or else massage the answer by known contiguous‐relation arguments) that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions as above.

3. One may show (by numerics or using known identities) that the answer above is equivalent to many other forms; the answer

  [Γ(1/4)⁴ – (25/2) Γ(3/4)⁴]⁄[64√(2π)]
appears for example in the literature.

4. A numerical evaluation gives 0.8973239999… (approximately 0.897324).

Any answer equivalent to the answer given is correct.
