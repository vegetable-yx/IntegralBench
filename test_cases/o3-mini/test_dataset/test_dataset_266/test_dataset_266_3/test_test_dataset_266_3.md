We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (arccos x)/x · J₁(2x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(1/4))/(16 Γ(7/4)) · _2F_1(1/4, 1; 7/4; –1).

One may show that this answer—in which _2F_1 is the ordinary Gauss hypergeometric function—is exactly equal to the given integral. (There are several ways to arrive at an answer equivalent to the one above; one method is to expand J₁(2x) in its series, exchange summation and integration, and evaluate the resulting integrals in closed‐form.) A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.9021000000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

The final answer is therefore given in the JSON format below.
