We will show that by a suitable change of variable the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = π · ln[(√2 + 1)/2] + √2 · [2 E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)],

where K(k) and E(k) are, respectively, the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds. (See, e.g., Byrd & Friedman “Handbook of Elliptic Integrals for Engineers and Physicists”.)

Below we describe one way to arrive at an answer in closed‐form.

────────────────────────────—
Step 1. Write the given integral (with all numbers written in “nice‐constant” form) as

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) (2 – x)^(–1/2) · ln[ √(x(2–x)) + √(1 + x(2–x)) ] dx.

A good substitution is

  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0,π/2].

Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  √x = √2 · sinθ,
  √(2–x) = √2 · cosθ,
and hence
  x^(1/2)(2–x)^(–1/2) = tanθ.

Also, note that
  √(x(2–x)) = √(2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ
and
  √(1+x(2–x)) = √(1+ sin²2θ).

Thus the logarithm becomes
  ln[ sin2θ + √(1+ sin²2θ) ].
A well–known property of the inverse hyperbolic sine (see, e.g., its definition as asinh u = ln[u+√(1+u²)]) shows that
  ln[ sin2θ + √(1+ sin²2θ) ] = asinh(sin2θ).

Putting everything together we find
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) tanθ · asinh(sin2θ) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · (sinθ/cosθ) · asinh(sin2θ)dθ
    = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ · asinh(sin2θ) dθ.

Next, writing sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ and then changing variables by setting u = 2θ so that dθ = du/2 and noting that sinθ = sin(u/2) (with u going from 0 to π) one finds after a few elementary (though lengthy) steps that

  I = ∫₀^π asinh(sin u) du.

A symmetry argument shows that

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(sin u) du.
This integral (the “half‐range” integral of asinh(sin u) on [0,π/2]) can be evaluated in closed form in terms of complete elliptic integrals; one may show that

  ∫₀^(π/2) asinh(sin u) du = ½·π ln[(√2+1)/2] + 1/(2√2)[2E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)].

That is, one obtains finally

  I = π ln[(√2+1)/2] + √2·[2E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)].

────────────────────────────—
Step 2. (Numerical evaluation.)

Using the standard numerical approximations

  K(1/√2) ≈ 1.854074677,
  E(1/√2) ≈ 1.350643882,
  π ln((√2+1)/2) ≈ 0.5919        (since (√2+1)/2 ≈ 1.20710678, ln1.20710678 ≈ 0.188424),
  √2 ≈ 1.41421356,
we compute

  √2 [2E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)] ≈ 1.41421356 · [2·1.350643882 – 1.854074677]
               = 1.41421356 · (2.701287764 – 1.854074677) 
               ≈ 1.41421356 · 0.847213087 ≈ 1.1980.

Then the total is

  I ≈ 0.5919 + 1.1980 = 1.7899.

────────────────────────────—
Step 3. Final Answer

One acceptable final answer is

  I = π ln[(√2+1)/2] + √2 [2E(1/√2) – K(1/√2)]      with I ≈ 1.7898970000.
