We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from 0 to 1 |1 − |1 − |1 − x||| dx.

Step 1. Define the innermost absolute value.
  Let A(x) = |1 − x|.
Since for x ∈ [0, 1] we have 1 − x ≥ 0, it follows that
  A(x) = 1 − x.

Step 2. Consider the next nested absolute value.
  Let B(x) = |1 − A(x)| = |1 − (1 − x)| = |x|.
Again, since x ∈ [0, 1] implies x ≥ 0, we have
  B(x) = x.

Step 3. Now evaluate the outermost absolute value.
  f(x) = |1 − B(x)| = |1 − x|.
For x ∈ [0, 1], 1 − x is nonnegative; therefore,
  f(x) = 1 − x.

Step 4. Substitute f(x) into the integral.
  I = ∫ from 0 to 1 (1 − x) dx.
This is a basic integral. Compute it as:
  I = [x − (x²)/2] evaluated from 0 to 1 = (1 − ½) − (0 − 0) = ½.

Step 5. Provide a numerical approximation.
  The exact result is ½, which numerically is 0.5. To 10 decimal places, that is 0.5000000000.

Thus, the final answer is:

{"answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "numerical_answer": "0.5000000000"}
