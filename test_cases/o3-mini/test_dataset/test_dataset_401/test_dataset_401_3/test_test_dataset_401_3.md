We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₀¹ |1 – |1 – |1 – x||| dx.
We begin by “unwrapping” the absolute values step by step.

Step 1. Define the innermost expression:
  A = |1 – x|.
For x in the interval [0, 1] we have 1 – x ≥ 0, so
  A = 1 – x.

Step 2. Next, consider the next layer:
  B = |1 – A| = |1 – (1 – x)| = |x|.
But for x in [0, 1], x is nonnegative so
  B = x.

Step 3. Now, the outer absolute value is:
  f(x) = |1 – B| = |1 – x|.
Again, for x in [0, 1] we have 1 – x ≥ 0, so
  f(x) = 1 – x.

Thus, the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀¹ (1 – x) dx.
We now compute this integral:
  ∫ (1 – x) dx = x – ½ x² + C.
Evaluating from x = 0 to x = 1:
  I = [1 – ½(1)²] – [0 – ½(0)²] = 1 – ½ = ½.

The exact answer is ½ in LaTeX form:
  \frac{1}{2}.

The numerical approximation is:
  0.5000000000
