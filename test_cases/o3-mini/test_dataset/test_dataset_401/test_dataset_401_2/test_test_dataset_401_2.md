To evaluate the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| dx

we start by simplifying the expression step by step.

Step 1. Define the inner expression:
  Let A = |1 - x|. On the interval x ∈ [0, 1], we have 1 - x ≥ 0, so
    A = 1 - x.

Step 2. Evaluate the next absolute value:
  Let B = |1 - A| = |1 - (1 - x)| = |x|.
  Since x ∈ [0, 1] (nonnegative), we have
    B = x.

Step 3. Evaluate the outermost absolute value:
  The function becomes
    f(x) = |1 - B| = |1 - x|.
  Again, on [0, 1] we have 1 - x ≥ 0, so
    f(x) = 1 - x.

Step 4. Now, calculate the integral:
  I = ∫₀¹ (1 - x) dx
    = [x - (x²/2)]₀¹
    = [1 - 1/2] - [0 - 0]
    = 1/2.

Step 5. Numerical approximation:
  The exact answer is 1/2, which is numerically 0.5. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it is 0.5000000000.

Thus, the final results are:

{"answer": "\\frac{1}{2}", "numerical_answer": "0.5000000000"}
