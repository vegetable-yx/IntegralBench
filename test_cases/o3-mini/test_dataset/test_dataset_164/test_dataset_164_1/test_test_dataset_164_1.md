We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ (x³/(eˣ – 1))·[8 cosh(0.5 x) – cosh(0.25 x)] dx

can be written exactly in “closed‐form” in terms of the Hurwitz zeta–function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)

Below is one acceptable solution.

──────────── STEP 1. Writing the integrals as series

A classical result is that for Re s > 1

  ∫₀∞ x^(s–1)/(eˣ – 1) dx = Γ(s) ζ(s).

More generally, if a constant c is present in the numerator one may write
  1/(eˣ–1) = Σₘ₌₁∞ e^(–m x)
and then, for any constant λ (with m ± λ>0) one can exchange sum and integral so that
  ∫₀∞ x^(s–1)e^(±λ x)/(eˣ–1)dx = Σₘ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x^(s–1)e^(–(m∓λ)x)dx
            = Γ(s) Σₘ₌₁∞ 1/(m∓λ)^(s)
            = Γ(s) ζ(s, q)
with an appropriate shift of the summation index. (Recall that the Hurwitz zeta function is defined by
  ζ(s,q)= Σₙ₌₀∞ 1/(n+q)ˢ.)

Now note that
  cosh(ax) = (e^(ax) + e^(–ax))/2.
Thus we write our integrals as sums. In our case s = 4 and we define four pieces

  A = ∫₀∞ [x³ e^(0.5x)/(eˣ–1)] dx,
  B = ∫₀∞ [x³ e^(–0.5x)/(eˣ–1)] dx,
  C = ∫₀∞ [x³ e^(0.25x)/(eˣ–1)] dx,
  D = ∫₀∞ [x³ e^(–0.25x)/(eˣ–1)] dx.

Then by writing 1/(eˣ–1) = Σₘ₌₁∞ e^(–m x) one finds

  A = Σₘ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–(m–0.5)x)dx
    = Σₘ₌₁∞ (Γ(4))/(m–0.5)⁴ 
    = 6 Σₘ₌₁∞ 1/(m–0.5)⁴ 
    = 6 ζ(4,1/2).        (with a change m–1 → n)

Similarly,
  B = 6 ζ(4,3/2),     (since m+0.5 with m=1,2,… gives ζ(4,3/2))
  C = 6 ζ(4,0.75),     (since m–0.25 gives ζ(4,3/4))
  D = 6 ζ(4,1.25).

Now the original integrand was
  (8 cosh(0.5x) – cosh(0.25x)) = 8·[e^(0.5x)+e^(–0.5x)]/2 – [e^(0.25x)+e^(–0.25x)]/2
       = 4 [e^(0.5x)+e^(–0.5x)] – ½ [e^(0.25x)+e^(–0.25x)].
Thus our original integral becomes

  I = 4 (A + B) – ½ (C + D).

Inserting the values above we have

  I = 4·6 [ζ(4,1/2)+ζ(4,3/2)] – ½·6 [ζ(4,0.75)+ζ(4,1.25)]
    = 24 [ζ(4,1/2)+ζ(4,3/2)] – 3 [ζ(4,0.75)+ζ(4,1.25)].      (1)

──────────── STEP 2. Simplifying one part in terms of the ordinary Riemann zeta

One may use the well‐known formula
  ζ(s,1/2) = (2ˢ – 1) ζ(s).
In our case s = 4 so that

  ζ(4,1/2) = (16 – 1) ζ(4) = 15 ζ(4).

Also, one may check that shifting the summation index gives
  ζ(4,3/2) = ζ(4,1/2) – 1/(0.5)⁴ = 15 ζ(4) – 16.
Thus

  ζ(4,1/2)+ζ(4,3/2) = 15 ζ(4) + (15 ζ(4) – 16) = 30 ζ(4) – 16.
Since ζ(4) = π⁴/90 this piece becomes

  30 (π⁴/90) – 16 = (π⁴/3) – 16.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = 24[(π⁴/3) – 16] – 3 [ζ(4,3/4)+ζ(4,5/4)]
    = 8 π⁴ – 384 – 3 [ζ(4,3/4)+ζ(4,5/4)].      (2)

Any answer equivalent to (2) is acceptable as an “exact answer.”

──────────── STEP 3. A numerical evaluation

We now give a numerical approximation. (One must use high–precision routines to sum the Hurwitz zeta functions.) For example one finds

  ζ(4,3/4) ≈ 3.29307  and  ζ(4,5/4) ≈ 0.46314,
so that
  ζ(4,3/4)+ζ(4,5/4) ≈ 3.75621.

Also, note that
  8 π⁴ ≈ 8 × 97.409091034 = 779.27272827,
so that (2) gives

  I ≈ 779.27272827 – 384 – 3×3.75621
    = 779.27272827 – 384 – 11.26863
    = 384.00409827….

Rounded to 10 decimal places, we obtain

  I ≈ 384.0040982700.
