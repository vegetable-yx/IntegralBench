We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀∞ [x³/(eˣ – 1)] · [8 cosh(0.5x) – cosh(0.25x)] dx.

Because the integrals involved have the form

  ∫₀∞ x³ e^(αx)/(eˣ – 1) dx

(for various choices of α) it is natural to expand 1/(eˣ – 1) in a series and then integrate term‐by‐term.

Step 1. Write the cosh functions in exponential form.
Recall 
  cosh(ax) = (e^(ax) + e^(–ax))/2.
Thus we have
  8 cosh(0.5x) – cosh(0.25x)
   = 8·[e^(0.5x) + e^(–0.5x)]/2 – [e^(0.25x) + e^(–0.25x)]/2
   = 4[e^(0.5x) + e^(–0.5x)] – ½ [e^(0.25x) + e^(–0.25x)].

So the whole integral breaks into a sum of four parts. It is most convenient, however, to define

  I(a) = ∫₀∞ [x³ e^(ax)/(eˣ – 1)] dx.

Then our integral is
  I = 8I(0.5, +) –  I(0.25, +)
     + 8I(–0.5, +) –  I(–0.25, +)
  where we write I(a, +) to indicate the use of e^(ax).

But note that cosh is even so we may combine the two parts with ±a. In other words, we define
  J(a) = ½ [I(a) + I(–a)] = ½ [∫₀∞ x³ e^(ax)/(eˣ – 1) dx + ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–ax)/(eˣ – 1) dx].
Then the original integral becomes
  I = 8J(0.5) – J(0.25).

Step 2. Express I(a) by a sum. 

Since
  1/(eˣ – 1) = Σₙ₌₁∞ e^(–nx)
(for x > 0), we can write
  I(a) = ∫₀∞ x³ e^(ax) Σₙ₌₁∞ e^(–nx) dx
     = Σₙ₌₁∞ ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–(n–a)x) dx.
For n > a the integral converges and we may use
  ∫₀∞ x³ e^(–λx) dx = 6/λ⁴.
Thus
  I(a) = Σₙ₌₁∞ 6/(n – a)⁴.
Likewise, 
  I(–a) = Σₙ₌₁∞ 6/(n + a)⁴.
So
  J(a) = ½ [I(a)+I(–a)] = 3 Σₙ₌₁∞ [1/(n – a)⁴ + 1/(n + a)⁴].

It is convenient to recognize that these sums are given in terms of Hurwitz zeta functions. In general,
  ζ(s, q) = Σₙ₌₀∞ 1/(n+q)ˢ.
Thus, making a change of index we have
  Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n – a)⁴ = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m + (1 – a))⁴ = ζ(4, 1 – a)
and
  Σₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n + a)⁴ = ζ(4, 1 + a).

Thus we may write
  J(a) = 3 [ζ(4, 1 – a) + ζ(4, 1 + a)].

Let us now set:
  For a = 0.5: 
   J(0.5) = 3 [ζ(4, 0.5) + ζ(4, 1.5)].
  For a = 0.25: 
   J(0.25) = 3 [ζ(4, 0.75) + ζ(4, 1.25)].

Then our original integral is
  I = 8J(0.5) – J(0.25)
    = 3 {8 [ζ(4, 0.5) + ζ(4, 1.5)] – [ζ(4, 0.75) + ζ(4, 1.25)]}.

Step 3. Evaluate the Hurwitz zeta functions when the arguments are rational numbers.

There is a well‐known formula for ζ(4, q) when q = 1/2. Namely,
  ζ(4, 1/2) = (2^4 – 1) ζ(4) = 15 ζ(4).
But since
  ζ(4) = π⁴/90,
we get
  ζ(4, 1/2) = (15π⁴)/90 = π⁴/6.

Also, there is a functional relation between the values at 1 – a and 1 + a. In fact, one may show by writing
  ζ(4, 1+a) = ζ(4, (1–a)+a*2?) 
more directly one can “shift” the argument. Notice that for any q,
  ζ(s, q+1) = ζ(s, q) – 1/qˢ.
For a = 0.5 we have
  ζ(4, 1.5) = ζ(4, 0.5) – 1/(0.5)⁴ = (π⁴/6) – 16.
Thus
  ζ(4, 0.5) + ζ(4, 1.5) = (π⁴/6) + [(π⁴/6) – 16] = π⁴/3 – 16.
It follows that
  J(0.5) = 3 (π⁴/3 – 16) = π⁴ – 48.

Now, for a = 0.25 the two Hurwitz zeta functions are
  ζ(4, 0.75)   and  ζ(4, 1.25).
We can “shift” the second one:
  ζ(4, 1.25) = ζ(4, 0.25 + 1) = ζ(4, 0.25) – 1/(0.25)⁴ = ζ(4, 0.25) – 256.
There is a classical result (which can be obtained, for instance, by relating these Hurwitz zeta‐values to certain Dirichlet L‑functions) that
  ζ(4, 0.25) + ζ(4, 0.75) = π⁴/3.
Thus,
  ζ(4, 0.75) + ζ(4, 1.25) = [ζ(4, 0.75) + ζ(4, 0.25)] – 256 = π⁴/3 – 256.
Then
  J(0.25) = 3 [ζ(4, 0.75) + ζ(4, 1.25)] = 3 (π⁴/3 – 256) = π⁴ – 768.

Step 4. Combine the results.

Recall that
  I = 8J(0.5) – J(0.25).
Substitute our evaluations:
  8J(0.5) = 8(π⁴ – 48) = 8π⁴ – 384,
  J(0.25) = π⁴ – 768.
Thus,
  I = (8π⁴ – 384) – (π⁴ – 768) = 7π⁴ + 384.

That is the exact answer.

Step 5. Numerical approximation.

We have π⁴. Numerically, with π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  π⁴ ≈ 97.4090910340.
Then
  7π⁴ ≈ 7 × 97.4090910340 = 681.8636372380,
and adding 384 gives
  I ≈ 681.8636372380 + 384 = 1065.8636372380.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical answer is 1065.8636372380.

Finally, we output the result in the specified JSON format.
