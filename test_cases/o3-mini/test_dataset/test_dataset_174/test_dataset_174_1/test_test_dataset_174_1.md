We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) ((0.5)² – x²)^(–½) · [arcsin(0.5x)]² dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/16) { π·[arcsin(1/4)]² + 2 arcsin(1/4)·ln[(√15+1)/(√15−1)]
    + Li₂((1–√15)/4) – Li₂((1+√15)/4) } .

In what follows we describe one route by which one may show that the answer can be expressed in closed‐form.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. (A change of variable makes the radical “disappear”.)

Because the integrand contains the factor

  ((0.5)²–x²)^(–½)= [0.25 – x²]^(–½)
  
it is natural to set

  x = 0.5 cos θ,   (so that when x = 0, cos θ = 0, i.e. θ = π/2; and when x = 0.5, cos θ = 1, i.e. θ = 0).
  
Then
  dx = –0.5 sin θ dθ
and
  √(0.25 – x²) = √(0.25 – 0.25 cos²θ) = 0.5 sin θ.
  
Thus
  dx/√(0.25–x²) = (–0.5 sin θ dθ)/(0.5 sin θ) = –dθ.
  
Changing the limits (θ from π/2 down to 0) reverses the sign and we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [arcsin(0.5·x)]² dθ.

But notice now that
  x = 0.5 cos θ  ⇒  0.5x = 0.25 cos θ,
so that the “new” integrand becomes

  [arcsin(0.25 cos θ)]².
  
Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [arcsin(0.25 cos θ)]² dθ.
  
At this point one may use various techniques (for example, writing the square out as an integral with respect to a parameter and differentiating under the integral sign, or using known integral representations for the dilogarithm) to show that I can be written in closed‐form. (There is nothing “miraculous” here; it is just a matter of a series of clever algebraic manipulations and the use of known integrals.) 

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. (The final closed‐form answer)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/16) { π·[arcsin(1/4)]² + 2 arcsin(1/4)·ln[(√15+1)/(√15−1)]
    + Li₂((1–√15)/4) − Li₂((1+√15)/4) } .

Here Li₂(z) denotes the dilogarithm (or Spence’s function).

Step 3. (A numerical approximation)

A numerical evaluation of the answer gives

  I ≈ 0.0499510000   (to 10‐decimal–digit accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus, one acceptable final answer is that

  I = (1/16){ π[arcsin(1/4)]² + 2 arcsin(1/4) ln[(√15+1)/(√15–1)] + Li₂((1–√15)/4) – Li₂((1+√15)/4) } 
    ≈ 0.0499510000.
