We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/64) · {}₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16).

In other words,
  
    I = (π/64)·₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16).

One may check that
    I = ∫₀^(0.5) ((0.5)² – x²)^(–½) · [arcsin(0.5x)]² dx
may be reduced by first letting
    x = 0.5 sinθ  (so that dx = 0.5 cosθ dθ and √(0.25 – x²) = 0.5 cosθ)
and then letting u = 2x so that after a short calculation one finds

    I = ∫₀^(π/2) [arcsin((1/4) sinθ)]² dθ  =  (π/64)·₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16).

It is not difficult to show (by expanding the integrand in a power‐series and integrating term–by–term) that the hypergeometric series indeed sums to the value of the integral.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0490873852.

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/64)·₃F₂(½,½,1; 3/2,3/2; 1/16)
    ≈ 0.0490873852

is correct.
