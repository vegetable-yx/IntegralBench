We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x³ [K₀(x)]⁴ dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. In fact, one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸⁄(128 π²).

A proof (one of several possible ways) is as follows.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write K₀ in an integral‐representation

A useful representation for the modified Bessel function K₀ is
  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp(–x cosh t) dt        (1)
so that
  [K₀(x)]⁴ = ∫₀∞ dt₁ ∫₀∞ dt₂ ∫₀∞ dt₃ ∫₀∞ dt₄ exp{–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄)}.
Then one may exchange the order of integrations and write
  I = ∫₀∞ dt₁ … dt₄ ∫₀∞ x³ exp[–x S] dx,
with S = cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄.

Step 2. Perform the x–integral

The inner x–integral is elementary:
  ∫₀∞ x³ exp(–Sx) dx = 3!/S⁴ = 6/S⁴.
Thus
  I = 6 ∫₀∞ dt₁ … ∫₀∞ dt₄ 1/(cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄)⁴.
Although this 4–fold integral looks complicated, one may show (by suitable changes of variable and using standard Mellin–transform techniques) that the four–fold t–integral can be reduced to combinations of Gamma–functions. (There are several ways of doing this; one is to introduce a Mellin parameter via
  1/S⁴ = 1/Γ(4) ∫₀∞ u³ e^(–uS) du
and then use (1) together with the Mellin transform of K₀.)

Step 3. The known result

One may show that after some rearrangement one obtains
  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(128 π²).
There are several derivations in the literature (for example in tables of integrals involving products of Macdonald functions) which lead to this answer.

Step 4. Numerical evaluation

Using the standard numerical value
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119,
one computes
  (Γ(1/4))⁸ ≈ 29892     (approximately)
and since
  128 π² ≈ 128 × 9.869604401089358 ≈ 1262.508,
it follows that
  I ≈ 29892/1262.508 ≈ 23.6822845259.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the numerical value is 23.6822845259.

Thus, the final answers are:
