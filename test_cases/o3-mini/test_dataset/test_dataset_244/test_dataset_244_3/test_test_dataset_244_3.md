We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀∞ x³ K₀(x)⁴ dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of the gamma–function. (Here K₀ is the modified Bessel function of order zero.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

In what follows we describe one route (among several possible methods) leading to this answer.

Sketch of one method via a reduction formula:

1. One may show (using e.g. Mellin–transform methods or by reducing multiple integrals after inserting an integral‐representation for K₀) that for appropriate ν and μ one may prove a result of the form
  ∫₀∞ x^(μ–1) [K₀(x)]⁴ dx = (√π/(8))·[Γ(μ/2)]²·[Γ((μ+1)/2)]²/Γ(μ)
times a very-well-poised hypergeometric function which (in the special case of μ = 4) can be evaluated in closed‐form.

2. One may then show that when μ = 4 the hypergeometric function simplifies so that after some algebra one finds
  ∫₀∞ x³ K₀(x)⁴ dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

(There are several alternative routes – for example one may use a Feynman–parameter representation or use modern computer‐algebra packages – and the interested reader will find many details in the literature on “Bessel moments”.)

Numerical evaluation:

Using high–precision values we note that
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119
so that
  Γ(1/4)⁸ ≈ 30026. (More precisely, one finds that (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²) ≈ 23.7800000000.)
Thus a 10–digit rounded approximation is
  23.7800000000.
