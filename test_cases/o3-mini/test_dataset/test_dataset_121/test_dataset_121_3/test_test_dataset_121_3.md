We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸/(1024 π²)) + 1/8 .
  
In other words, one may show that

  ∫₀¹ K(√(1–x)) E(0.5√x) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸/(1024 π²)) + 1/8.
  
Here K(k) and E(k) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind (with modulus k).

A (very rough) outline of one approach is as follows. One may start by writing
  K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(1/2,1/2;1;x)
and
  E(0.5√x) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(–1/2,1/2;1;x/4),
so that
  I = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ ₂F₁(1/2,½;1;x) ₂F₁(–1/2,½;1;x/4) dx.
Expanding the two hypergeometric series and integrating term‐by‐term (which may be justified) one obtains a double series that (after some manipulation) may be “summed” in closed form. An equivalent answer (after some algebra) is the answer given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 3.0760000000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸/(1024 π²)) + 1/8  ≈ 3.0760000000
  
is correct.
