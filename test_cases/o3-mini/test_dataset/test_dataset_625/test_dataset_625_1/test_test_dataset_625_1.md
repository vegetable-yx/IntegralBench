We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ √[4]{(1/x - 1)} dx = ∫₀¹ [(1/x - 1)]^(1/4) dx.

Step 1. Change of Variables

Let
  u = (1/x) - 1  ⟹ x = 1/(1+u).

Differentiate x with respect to u:
  dx/du = -1/(1+u)²  ⟹ dx = -du/(1+u)².

Change the limits:
  When x = 0⁺, u → ∞; when x = 1, u = (1/1) - 1 = 0.

Thus,
  I = ∫(u=∞ to 0) u^(1/4) [ -du/(1+u)² ] = ∫₀^∞ u^(1/4) / (1+u)² du.

Step 2. Express as a Beta Integral

Recall the standard form:
  ∫₀∞ u^(a-1)/(1+u)^(a+b) du = B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b),
with a > 0, b > 0.

Comparing, we have:
  u^(a-1) = u^(1/4) ⟹ a - 1 = 1/4 ⟹ a = 5/4,
and
  (1+u)^(a+b) = (1+u)² ⟹ a + b = 2 ⟹ b = 2 - 5/4 = 3/4.

Thus,
  I = B(5/4, 3/4) = Γ(5/4)Γ(3/4) / Γ(2).

Since Γ(2) = 1, we have:
  I = Γ(5/4)Γ(3/4).

Step 3. Simplify the Gamma Functions

Notice that the Gamma function satisfies Γ(z+1) = zΓ(z). Therefore,
  Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4).

It is a known result that:
  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π√2.

Thus,
  I = (1/4) Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = (1/4) (π√2) = (π√2)/4.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

We now approximate:
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  √2 ≈ 1.4142135624,
  (π√2) ≈ 3.1415926536 × 1.4142135624 ≈ 4.442882938,
  I = 4.442882938 / 4 ≈ 1.1107207345.

Thus, the exact answer is (π√2)/4 and the numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places) is approximately 1.1107207345.
