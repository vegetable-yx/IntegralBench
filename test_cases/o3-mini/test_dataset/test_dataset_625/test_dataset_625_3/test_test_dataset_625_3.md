We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ √[4]{1/x – 1} dx.

Notice that

  √[4]{1/x – 1} = ((1/x – 1))^(1/4) = ((1 – x)/x)^(1/4) = (1 – x)^(1/4) / x^(1/4).

Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ (1 – x)^(1/4) x^(–1/4) dx.

This is a standard Beta integral. In general, one has

  ∫₀¹ x^(p–1)(1–x)^(q–1) dx = B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q).

Here, comparing exponents, we set
  p – 1 = –1/4 ⟹ p = 3/4,
  q – 1 = 1/4  ⟹ q = 5/4.

Thus,

  I = B(3/4, 5/4) = Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) / Γ(3/4 + 5/4).

Since 3/4 + 5/4 = 2 and Γ(2) = 1, we have

  I = Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4).

We can further simplify by using the property Γ(z+1) = z Γ(z). With z = 1/4 we have

  Γ(5/4) = (1/4) Γ(1/4).

It is also known that

  Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π √2.

Therefore, substituting we get

  I = Γ(3/4) (1/4) Γ(1/4) = (1/4) [Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4)] = (π √2)/4.

A numerical approximation is computed as follows:
  π ≈ 3.141592653589793,
  √2 ≈ 1.414213562373095,
  thus (π √2)/4 ≈ (3.141592653589793 × 1.414213562373095)/4 ≈ 4.442882938158366/4 ≈ 1.1107207345395915.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, we have 1.1107207345.
