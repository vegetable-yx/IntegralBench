We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^( (2·1–1)/4 ) (2–x)^(0.5/2) J₁₋0.5(1·√x) J₀.₅(1·√(2–x)) dx 
    = ∫₀² x^(1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) J₀.₅(√x) J₀.₅(√(2–x)) dx

may be written in a “closed‐form” answer. In what follows one acceptable answer is

  I = (2·Γ(5/4)²/√π) [ sin(√2) – √2 cos(√2) ].

Below we describe one route to this result.

1. Transforming the integrals using half‐integer Bessel functions

Recall that for ν = 1/2 the Bessel function can be written in closed form:
  J₁/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) sin z.
Since in our integral the orders are 0.5 we have
  J₀.₅(√x) = √(2/(π√x)) sin(√x)
  and J₀.₅(√(2–x)) = √(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√(2–x)).

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4)(2–x)^(1/4) · √(2/(π√x)) sin(√x) · √(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√(2–x)) dx.
    = (2/π) ∫₀² x^(1/4–1/2)(2–x)^(1/4–1/2) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)) dx
    = (2/π) ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–1/4) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)) dx.
(One may check that it is better to “shift” the powers by writing x^(1/4) = x^((5/4)–1) etc. so that eventually one may show by a known Sonine‐type formula that, with the identification
  μ = ν = 5/4   and  2√(β x)= √x   (so that β = 1/4),
one obtains)

  I = Γ(5/4)² (1/4)^(1–(5/4+5/4)/2) 2^((5/4+5/4–1)/2) J_(5/4+5/4–1)(2√(β·2)).

A short calculation shows that in our case this gives

  I = Γ(5/4)² · (1/4)^(–1/4) 2^(3/4) J₃/₂(√2).

Since (1/4)^(–1/4) = 4^(1/4) = 2^(1/2), we deduce

  I = 2^(5/4) Γ(5/4)² J₃/₂(√2).

Using the standard formula
  J₃/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) [ (sin z)/z – cos z ],
with z = √2, we have
  J₃/₂(√2) = √(2/(π√2)) [ (sin√2)/√2 – cos√2 ].
A short calculation shows that
  √(2/(π√2)) = 2^(1/4)/√π.
Thus,
  J₃/₂(√2) = (2^(1/4)/√π)[ (sin√2)/√2 – cos√2 ].
Then
  I = 2^(5/4) Γ(5/4)² · (2^(1/4)/√π)[ (sin√2)/√2 – cos√2 ]
    = 2^(5/4+1/4) Γ(5/4)²/√π · [ (sin√2)/√2 – cos√2 ]
    = 2^(3/2) Γ(5/4)²/√π [ (sin√2)/√2 – cos√2 ].
A little algebra (multiplying numerator and denominator by √2) yields the equivalent form

  I = (2·Γ(5/4)²/√π)[ sin√2 – √2 cos√2 ].

2. Final Answer and a Numerical Approximation

Thus one acceptable exact answer is

  I = (2·Γ(5/4)²/√π) ( sin(√2) – √2 cos(√2) ).

A numerical evaluation gives
  Γ(5/4) ≈ 0.9064024771  →  Γ(5/4)² ≈ 0.821000,
  2/√π ≈ 1.1283791671,
  sin(√2) ≈ 0.987765945,  cos(√2) ≈ 0.155943694.
Then
  sin(√2) – √2 cos(√2) ≈ 0.987765945 – 1.414213562×0.155943694 ≈ 0.767425945.
Thus,
  I ≈ 1.1283791671 × 0.821000 × 0.767425945 ≈ 0.7112540000.
