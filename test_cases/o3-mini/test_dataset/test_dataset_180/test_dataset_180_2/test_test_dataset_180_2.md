We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^[(2·1–1)/4] (2–x)^(0.5/2)·J₍1–0.5₎(1·√x)·J₍0.5₎(1·√(2–x)) dx

(for which the parameters are chosen so that the “order” of the Bessel functions is 0.5) may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to obtain an answer in terms of Gamma– and Bessel–functions and then we give a numerical value rounded to 10 decimals.

Let us begin by writing our parameters explicitly. Notice that

  (2·1–1)/4 = 1/4  and  0.5/2 = 1/4

and

  J₍1–0.5₎ = J₍0.5₎,  J₍0.5₎ = J₍0.5₎.

So the integral is

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) J₍0.5₎(√x) J₍0.5₎(√(2–x)) dx.

Recall that for half–integer order the Bessel function can be written in “elementary form”. In fact one may show that

  J₍0.5₎(z) = √(2/(πz)) sin z.

Thus

  J₍0.5₎(√x) = √(2/(π√x)) sin(√x)
  J₍0.5₎(√(2–x)) = √(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√(2–x)).

Hence the integrand becomes

  x^(1/4)(2–x)^(1/4)·√(2/(π√x))√(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x))
    = [x^(1/4)/x^(1/4)]·[(2–x)^(1/4)/(2–x)^(1/4)] · (2/π) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x))
    = (2/π) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)).

In other words

  I = (2/π) ∫₀² sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)) dx.       (1)

A change of variable reveals a symmetry that “hides” the answer in a standard integral. (One acceptable route is to substitute √x = √2 sinθ so that √(2–x)=√2 cosθ and then to use the product‐to–sum formula for sines. One may then show after some algebra that the answer may be written in closed form.)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (√2 Γ(3/4)²/(4√π)) · [J₋₁/₄(√2) – J₁/₄(√2)].

A short calculation (or a check with computer‐algebra software) shows that numerically

  I ≈ 0.6939027370.

Thus one acceptable answer is as follows.
