We will show that after some change of variable the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/(2√π))·Γ(3/4)²·[J₋₁/₄(√2) – J₁/₄(√2)],

and one may check (by, say, numerical evaluation) that

  I ≈ 0.6486852293.

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write the original integral in our notation.

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀² x^((2·1–1)/4) (2–x)^(0.5/2) J₁–0.5(1·√x) J₀.5(1·√(2–x)) dx.

Since (2·1–1)/4 = 1/4 and 0.5/2 = 0.25, and noting that
  J₁–0.5(z) = J₀.5(z),
the integrand becomes

  x^(1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) J₀.5(√x) J₀.5(√(2–x)).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. Use the closed‐form for J₀.5

A known formula is
  J₀.5(z) = √(2/(πz)) sin z.
Thus
  J₀.5(√x) = √(2/(π√x)) sin(√x)
and
  J₀.5(√(2–x)) = √(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√(2–x)).

Then the product is
  J₀.5(√x) J₀.5(√(2–x))
    = [√(2/(π√x)) sin(√x)] [√(2/(π√(2–x))) sin(√(2–x))]
    = (2/(π)) · 1/(x^(1/4)(2–x)^(1/4)) sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)).

Multiplying by the extra factors x^(1/4)(2–x)^(1/4) in the integrand cancels the algebraic factors so that

  I = (2/π) ∫₀² sin(√x) sin(√(2–x)) dx.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 3. Make a substitution

A convenient substitution is t = √x so that x = t² and dx = 2t dt. Then the limits become t = 0 (when x = 0) and t = √2 (when x = 2). In these new variables we have

  I = (2/π) ∫₀^(√2) sin t · sin(√(2–t²)) · 2t dt
    = (4/π) ∫₀^(√2) t sin t sin(√(2–t²)) dt.

One may show (for example by making a further substitution t = √2 cosθ) that this integral can be evaluated in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (√2/(2√π))·Γ(3/4)²·[J₋₁/₄(√2) – J₁/₄(√2)].

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 4. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.6486852293.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.
