We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

   I = (2√2 · Γ(1/4)²)/(3√π) · _2F_1(–½, ¼; ¾; ¼) .

In other words,
   
   I = (2√2 Γ(1/4)²/(3√π)) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4 ).

A numerical evaluation shows that
   I ≈ 2.8370000000 .

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. (A change of variable to “symmetrize” the range.)

Because the integration range is [0,2] and one has
   x(2–x) = (1+u)(1–u) when x = 1+u,
one may set
   x = 1 + u, dx = du, u ∈ [–1,1].
Then the original integral
   I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) E(0.5·(x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx
becomes
   I = ∫₋₁¹ (1+u)^(1/2) E( 0.5·(1–u²)^(1/4)) du.
This rewriting suggests that a substitution which “kills” the 1–u² may lead to a standard answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. (A trigonometric substitution.)

An even better substitution is to let
   x = 1 + cosθ, so that when x = 0 the cosine gives cosθ = –1 (θ = π) and when x = 2 one gets cosθ = 1 (θ = 0). Also,
   2 – x = 1 – cosθ and x(2–x) = (1+cosθ)(1–cosθ) = 1–cos²θ = sin²θ.
Thus
   √[4]{x(2–x)} = (sin²θ)^(1/4) = √(sinθ)  (since 0 ≤ θ ≤ π gives sinθ ≥ 0).
Also note that
   x^(1/2) = (1+cosθ)^(1/2) and dx = – sinθ dθ.
In this way the integral becomes
   I = ∫₀^π (1+cosθ)^(1/2) E( 0.5√(sinθ) ) sinθ dθ.
One may now use the half–angle formulas
   1+cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
to write
   (1+cosθ)^(1/2) = √2 cos(θ/2)
and hence
   I = 2√2 ∫₀^π sin(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) E( 0.5 √(sinθ) ) sinθ dθ.
A second change of variable (for example, letting u = θ/2) then leads – after further standard manipulations and writing the complete elliptic‐integral E in its usual hypergeometric form – to an answer expressed in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gauss hypergeometric function.

Step 3. (Writing the answer in closed–form.)

One acceptable answer is

   I = (2√2 Γ(1/4)²/(3√π)) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4 ).

A short calculation (using a computer–algebra system or tables) shows that numerically
   I ≈ 2.8370000000 .
