We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(12√(2π))) · [16·₂F₁(–½,1/4;5/4;1/2) – ₂F₁(½,1/4;5/4;1/2)],

i.e. 
  
    I = (Γ(1/4)²/(12√(2π)))·(16·₂F₁(–½,1/4;5/4;1/2) – ₂F₁(½,1/4;5/4;1/2)) .

One may show that after a few clever substitutions (for example one may begin by letting x = 2 sin²θ so that x(2–x) = 4sin²θ cos²θ = sin²(2θ) and hence 
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √(sin 2θ) ) the original integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2)·E(0.5·√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

reduces after some algebra to an expression in hypergeometric functions and Gamma–functions. (Also note that here E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, so that one may use the classical representation
  E(k) = (π/2)·₂F₁(–½,1/2;1;k²)
to convert the answer into hypergeometric form.) One may show that the answer above is equivalent to the result obtained by interchanging the sum and the x–integration and then summing the resulting beta–integrals.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.7868173210 .

Thus one acceptable final answer is that the given integral equals

  (Γ(1/4)²/(12√(2π)))[16·₂F₁(–½,1/4;5/4;1/2) – ₂F₁(½,1/4;5/4;1/2)]

with numerical value 2.7868173210.
