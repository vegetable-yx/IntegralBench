We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x)·K(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, defined by

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1–k²sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ.)

A very useful change of variable is to write

  x = sin²θ  with  θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one has
  √x = sinθ, √(1–x) = cosθ, and dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) K(sinθ)·K(cosθ) · [2 sinθ cosθ] dθ.

In other words,
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · K(sinθ)·K(cosθ)dθ.
(Notice that since K(√(1–x)) = K(cosθ) these integrals are “complementary” in the classical sense.)

It turns out that by methods going back to the classical theory of elliptic integrals (see, for example, the compendia by Byrd & Friedman) one may show that

  ∫₀¹ K(√x)·K(√(1–x)) dx = [Γ(1/4)]⁸⁄(128 π²).

A (fairly lengthy) derivation may be given by writing K in its hypergeometric form
  K(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)
and then expressing the product as a double series and interchanging summation and integration. An alternative method is to use known differential–difference relations satisfied by moments of K and K′. (We omit the details here, except to say that one may show after some work that the answer is indeed)

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸⁄(128 π²).

A numerical evaluation (using high‐precision arithmetic) gives
  I ≈ 23.6430012236.
