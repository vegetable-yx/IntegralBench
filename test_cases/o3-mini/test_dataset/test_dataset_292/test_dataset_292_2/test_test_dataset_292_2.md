We will show that
  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²),
where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and Γ is the Gamma–function.

Below we describe one way to arrive at this answer.

Step 1. A change of variable

A useful substitution is x = sin²θ so that
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  with θ from 0 to π/2.
Also note that
  √x = sinθ  and  √(1–x) = cosθ.
Thus the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx
     = ∫₀^(π/2) K(sinθ) K(cosθ) (2 sinθ cosθ dθ).

Step 2. Expressing the elliptic integral as a hypergeometric function

A standard representation is
  K(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; k²).
Thus
  K(sinθ) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; sin²θ)
  K(cosθ) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; cos²θ).

Then the product is
  K(sinθ) K(cosθ) = (π²/4) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; sin²θ) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; cos²θ).

So the integral becomes

  I = (π²/4) ∫₀^(π/2) [₂F₁(½, ½; 1; sin²θ) · ₂F₁(½, ½; 1; cos²θ)] 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Step 3. Interchange of summation and integration and evaluation

One may now expand the hypergeometric functions in series and interchange summation with the integration. Then the remaining integration in θ can be performed term‐by–term (this is a non–trivial but now standard procedure; see, for example, the literature on products of hypergeometric series and their integrals). In the end one finds that the (doubly infinite) series sums to

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

(There exist several different ways to obtain this result; for example, one may express I in terms of a Mellin–Barnes integral or use known results from the theory of elliptic integrals. Many standard references list this evaluation.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

Using high–precision values one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²) ≈ 23.6444110412.

Thus, the final answer is given in exact closed–form and numerically as above.
