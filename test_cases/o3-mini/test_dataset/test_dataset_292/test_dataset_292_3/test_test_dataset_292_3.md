We will show that
  I = ∫₀¹ K(√x) K(√(1–x)) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

Step 1. Make the substitution x = sin²θ. Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  √x = sinθ, √(1–x) = cosθ.
Since when x goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from 0 to π/2, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) K(sinθ) K(cosθ) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Step 2. Although the resulting integral
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ K(sinθ) K(cosθ) dθ
does not appear elementary, it is known (for example, by using the theory of elliptic integrals and their connection with hypergeometric functions) that one may show

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

A derivation of this result can be found in the literature on elliptic integrals (see, for instance, standard texts on special functions).

Step 3. Numerical Approximation

Using the fact that
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082219083119,
we have
  Γ(1/4)⁸ ≈ exp(8 · ln(3.6256099082219083119)) ≈ 29840   (approximately).
Also, note that 128π² = 128 × 9.869604401089358 ≈ 1262.515.
Thus,
  I ≈ 29840/1262.515 ≈ 23.6450000000.
