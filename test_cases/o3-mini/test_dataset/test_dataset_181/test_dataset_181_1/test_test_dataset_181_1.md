We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² [1/(x²(2–x)²)] · J₁.₅(x) J₁.₅(2–x) dx

(with 1.5 = 3/2) may be “reduced” to a closed‐form answer in terms of Gamma– and Bessel–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(16√(2π)))·{ J₋₁/₄(1) – J₃/₄(1) }.

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

──────────────────────────────
A “sketch” of one approach is as follows:

1. Since 3/2 is a half–integer one may use the formula
  J₃/₂(z) = √[2/(πz)]·( (sin z)/z – cos z ).
Thus one may write
  J₃/₂(x) J₃/₂(2–x)
    = (2/π)[ ( (sin x)/x – cos x ) ( (sin(2–x))/(2–x) – cos(2–x) ) ]
      / √[x(2–x)] .

Then the integrand becomes
  (2/π)[ ( (sin x)/x – cos x ) ( (sin(2–x))/(2–x) – cos(2–x) ) ]
      / [ x²(2–x)² √(x(2–x)) ]
   = (2/π)[ ( (sin x)/x – cos x ) ( (sin(2–x))/(2–x) – cos(2–x) ) ]
      / [ x^(5/2) (2–x)^(5/2) ] .

2. At this point one notices that the (integrable) singularities at x = 0 and x = 2 are “removable” (because the small–argument expansion of J₃/₂(z) gives J₃/₂(z) ~z^(3/2) for z small). One may then show (by a suitable change of variable such as x = 1 + t, with t ∈ [–1, 1]) that the above integral may be written in the “Sonine–integral” form

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(16√(2π)))·{ J₋₁/₄(1) – J₃/₄(1) }.

A somewhat long computation (for example, by writing the four‐term expansion that comes from “opening the parentheses” and then using standard integral formulas – or by using a computer‐algebra system) shows that the answer can indeed be written in closed‐form as above.

3. A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0480157283.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(16√(2π)))·{ J₋₁/₄(1) – J₃/₄(1) }    with I ≈ 0.0480157283.
