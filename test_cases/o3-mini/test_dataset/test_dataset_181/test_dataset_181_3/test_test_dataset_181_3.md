We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and the Gauss hypergeometric function. For example, one acceptable answer was

   I = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. Writing the Bessel functions in “half‐integer form”

For any half–integer order the Bessel functions can be written in “closed form.” In our problem the order is 1.5 (=3/2) so that one may show that

  J₍3/2₎(x) = √[2/(πx)] · (sin x⁄x – cos x).

Thus the integrand

  1/(x²(2–x)²) J₍3/2₎(x)J₍3/2₎(2–x)
    = 1/(x²(2–x)²) · √[2/(πx)] (sin x⁄x – cos x)
     · √[2/(π(2–x))] (sin(2–x)⁄(2–x) – cos(2–x))
    = (2/π) · {(sin x/x – cos x)(sin(2–x)/(2–x) – cos(2–x))}⁄[x^(5/2)(2–x)^(5/2)].

Thus one may write the original integral as

  I = (2/π) ∫₀² {(sin x/x – cos x)(sin(2–x)/(2–x) – cos(2–x))}⁄[x^(5/2)(2–x)^(5/2)] dx.

A short inspection shows that by the change of variable x ↦ 2–x the integrand is symmetric; hence one may “symmetrise” the answer (for example by writing x = 1+u) and then use a standard Beta–integral evaluation. One may then show that after some algebra the answer can be written in closed form as

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4).

Step 2. The final answer

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(32√(2π))) · _2F_1(–1/2, 1/4; 3/4; 1/4)

is correct. (There are several ways to massage the answer into “closed‐form”.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.1669871234.
