We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sin^(2n)x / (sin^(2n)x + cos^(2n)x)] dx.

Step 1. Notice that by making the substitution u = π/2 - x, we have:
  sin x = cos u  and  cos x = sin u.
Thus,
  I' = ∫₀^(π/2) [cos^(2n)x / (sin^(2n)x + cos^(2n)x)] dx,
which follows by symmetry.

Step 2. Now, add the original expression with the one from the substitution:
  I + I' = ∫₀^(π/2) { [sin^(2n)x + cos^(2n)x] / (sin^(2n)x + cos^(2n)x) } dx = ∫₀^(π/2) 1 dx = π/2.

Step 3. Since the substitution shows that I = I', we have:
  2I = π/2 ⇒  I = π/4.

Step 4. The numerical approximation of π/4 is approximately 0.7853981634 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
