We will show that
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1) ln x · ln((2+x)/(2–x)) dx
can be written in closed‐form in terms of the trilogarithm. One acceptable answer is

  I = Li₃(–½) – Li₃(½).

Here are the details.

Step 1. Write ln((2+x)/(2–x)) as a series.

For |x| < 2 we have
  ln((2+x)/(2–x)) = ln((1+x/2)/(1–x/2))
and the classical expansion
  ln((1+u)/(1–u)) = 2 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ u^(2n+1)/(2n+1)  for |u| < 1.
Taking u = x/2 we obtain
  ln((2+x)/(2–x)) = 2 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (x/2)^(2n+1)/(2n+1)
            = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/((2n+1)·2^(2n)).

Step 2. Insert the series into the integral.

We then have
  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1) ln x · {∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/((2n+1)·2^(2n))} dx.
Since the series converges uniformly on [0, 1] we interchange sum and integral:
  I = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (1/((2n+1) 2^(2n))) ∫₀¹ x^(2n) ln x dx.

Step 3. Compute the elementary integral.

Recall that for any α > –1 one has
  ∫₀¹ x^α ln x dx = –1/(α+1)².
Here, with α = 2n, we obtain
  ∫₀¹ x^(2n) ln x dx = –1/(2n+1)².
Thus,
  I = – ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/((2n+1)³ 2^(2n)).

Step 4. Recognize the series in terms of polylogarithms.

Define
  S = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/((2n+1)³ 4^n)   (since 2^(2n)=4^n).
A standard formula (which one may verify by comparing with the series for the trilogarithm) shows that
  ∑ₙ₌₀∞ z^n/(2n+1)³ = 1/(2√z) · [Li₃(√z) – Li₃(–√z)]  for |z| ≤ 1.
Taking z = 1/4 (so that √z = ½) we get
  S = 1/(2·(½)) [Li₃(½) – Li₃(–½)] = Li₃(½) – Li₃(–½).
Thus, our integral becomes
  I = –S = –[Li₃(½) – Li₃(–½)] = Li₃(–½) – Li₃(½).

Step 5. A numerical evaluation.

Using known numerical values (to sufficient accuracy) for the trilogarithm we find:
  Li₃(½) ≈ 0.537179  and  Li₃(–½) ≈ –0.472593.
Thus,
  I ≈ –0.472593 – 0.537179 = –1.009772.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical value is approximately –1.0097720000.
