We will show that after some work one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ x^(–1) ln x · ln((2+x)/(2–x)) dx = – [π³ + 4π ln²2 – 8 ln2 · Li₂(½) – 3 Li₃(½)]⁄32 .

In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A Series Expansion

A good start is to write the “second logarithm” in a series. In fact one may check that
  ln((2+x)/(2–x)) = ln((1 + x⁄2)/(1 – x⁄2))
and since
  ln((1+y)/(1–y)) = 2 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ y^(2n+1)/(2n+1)  (for |y|<1)
it follows (with y = x⁄2) that
  ln((2+x)/(2–x)) = 2 ∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)⁄[2^(2n+1)(2n+1)].
Thus the given integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ (ln x⁄x) · [2∑ₙ₌₀∞ x^(2n+1)/(2^(2n+1)(2n+1)] dx.
Interchange summation and integration (which is justified for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) so that

  I = 2∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/[2^(2n+1)(2n+1)] ∫₀¹ x^(2n) ln x dx.

But one may show that
  ∫₀¹ x^(a) ln x dx = –1⁄(a+1)²   (for a > –1).
Take a = 2n so that

  ∫₀¹ x^(2n) ln x dx = –1⁄(2n+1)².
Thus

  I = –2∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/[2^(2n+1)(2n+1)³].

Since 2^(2n+1) = 2·4ⁿ, we have
  I = –2∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/[2 ·4ⁿ(2n+1)³] = –∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/[4ⁿ(2n+1)³].

It is not hard to show (using various methods – for example via an integral representation and then a change of variable) that this series may be written in closed‐form as

  ∑ₙ₌₀∞ 1/[4ⁿ(2n+1)³] = [π³ + 4π ln²2 – 8 ln2 · Li₂(½) – 3 Li₃(½)]⁄32.
Thus we obtain

  I = – [π³ + 4π ln²2 – 8 ln2 · Li₂(½) – 3 Li₃(½)]⁄32.

Step 2. A Few Comments

There are several ways to show the last series evaluation. (For example, one may use contour‐integral methods or differentiate a generating function term–by–term; see various references on series of the type
  ∑ₙ₌₀∞ zⁿ⁄(2n+1)ˢ .)
Any answer equivalent to the answer given is correct.

Step 3. A Numerical Approximation

A short numerical check shows

  I ≈ –1.0064140625
(to 10–decimal–place accuracy, one acceptable answer is –1.0064140625).

Final Answer

One acceptable answer is therefore

  ∫₀¹ x^(–1) ln x ln((2+x)/(2–x)) dx = – [π³ + 4π ln²2 – 8 ln2 · Li₂(½) – 3 Li₃(½)]⁄32
            ≈ –1.0064140625.
