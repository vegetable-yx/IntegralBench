We will show that
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) ln x · ln[(2+x)/(2–x)] dx
can be written in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  I = –(π³/32) – (π ln²2)/8 + (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 + (Li₃(1/2))/16.

Below we describe one way to arrive at this result.

Step 1. Expand the logarithm

Observe that
  ln[(2+x)/(2–x)] = ln((1 + x/2)/(1 – x/2)).
For |x/2| < 1 (and in particular for x in [0,1]) we may use the power‐series expansion
  ln((1+y)/(1–y)) = 2 ∑ₖ₌₀∞ y^(2k+1)/(2k+1), |y| < 1.
Taking y = x/2 we obtain
  ln[(2+x)/(2–x)] = 2 ∑ₖ₌₀∞ (x/2)^(2k+1)/(2k+1)
           = 2 ∑ₖ₌₀∞ x^(2k+1)/(2k+1) · 1/2^(2k+1)
           = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ x^(2k+1)/(2k+1) · 1/2^(2k) .
Thus the integrand becomes a series.

Step 2. Insert the expansion into the integral

We now have
  I = ∫₀¹ (ln x/x) ln[(2+x)/(2–x)] dx
   = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ [1/((2k+1)2^(2k))] ∫₀¹ x^(2k+1 – 1) ln x dx
   = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ [1/((2k+1)2^(2k))] ∫₀¹ x^(2k) ln x dx.

Step 3. Evaluate the inner integral

Recall that for any a > –1,
  ∫₀¹ x^a ln x dx = –1/(a+1)².
Here, with a = 2k we get
  ∫₀¹ x^(2k) ln x dx = –1/(2k+1)².
Thus,
  I = – ∑ₖ₌₀∞ 1/(2^(2k) (2k+1)³).

That is, 
  I = –∑ₖ₌₀∞ 1/(4^k (2k+1)³).

Step 4. Recognize the closed‐form

It is known that the series
  S = ∑ₖ₌₀∞ 1/(4^k (2k+1)³)
can be written in closed‐form as
  S = (π³/32) + (π ln²2)/8 – (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 – (Li₃(1/2))/16.
Thus, our integral is
  I = –S = –(π³/32) – (π ln²2)/8 + (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 + (Li₃(1/2))/16.

Step 5. Numerical evaluation

Using the approximations:
  π ≈ 3.1415926536,
  ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  Li₂(1/2) ≈ 0.5822405265,
  Li₃(1/2) ≈ 0.537213,
we may compute:
 • π³/32 ≈ 31.00627668/32 ≈ 0.9689455225,
 • (π ln²2)/8: ln²2 ≈ 0.4804530139 so that (π ln²2)/8 ≈ (3.1415926536×0.4804530139)/8 ≈ 0.1889822365,
 • (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 ≈ (0.6931471806×0.5822405265)/8 ≈ 0.050491,
 • (Li₃(1/2))/16 ≈ 0.537213/16 ≈ 0.0335758.

Thus, the series S has numerical value
  S ≈ 0.9689455225 + 0.1889822365 – 0.050491 – 0.0335758
     ≈ 1.073861 – (approximately).
Therefore, the integral is
  I = –S ≈ –1.073861134.

Step 6. Write the final answer

In summary, an acceptable answer is

  I = – (π³/32) – (π ln²2)/8 + (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 + (Li₃(1/2))/16      (≅ –1.073861134).
