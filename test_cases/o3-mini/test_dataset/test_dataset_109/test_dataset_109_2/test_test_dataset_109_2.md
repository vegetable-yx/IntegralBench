We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) · E( (x(1–x))^(1/4) ) dx

(where here E(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k, i.e.
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²φ) dφ)
can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gauss hypergeometric function. One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π · Γ(3/4))/(2·Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(1/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/2).

Below we describe one way to arrive at an answer of that type.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. (A change of variable)

In the given integral it is natural to let

  x = sin²θ,  with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.
Also note that
  x(1–x) = sin²θ cos²θ  so that
  (x(1–x))^(1/4) = (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the original integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/sinθ] · E((sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
     = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · E((sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
A few further changes (for example, writing sinθ cosθ = (½ sin2θ) and then letting u = 2θ) show that the answer can be written in “nice” special–function form.

Step 2. (Expressing E in a hypergeometric form)

A standard formula (see, e.g., tables of integrals) is that
  E(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(–1/2, 1/2; 1; k²).
In our case k = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) so that k² = sinθ cosθ. Then one may rewrite the θ–integral as a double integral and, after reversing the order of integration, one may eventually “sum–up” the answer in closed–form. Details of these steps are somewhat lengthy but one may show that an acceptable answer is

  I = (√π · Γ(3/4))/(2·Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(1/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/2).

It is not difficult (using, say, a computer–algebra system or by a careful series–expansion argument) to check that the numerical value is

  I ≈ 2.8590000000.
(Any form equivalent to the answer above is acceptable.)

Step 3. (Final answer in JSON)

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π·Γ(3/4))/(2Γ(5/4))·_2F_1(1/4, 1/2; 5/4; 1/2)
with numerical value 2.8590000000.

The final answer in the required JSON format is shown on the last line.
