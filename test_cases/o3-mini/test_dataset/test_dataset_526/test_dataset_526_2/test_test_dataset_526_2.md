We start with the integral

  I = ∫₁^(√3) (arctan x + arccot x)/x dx.

Step 1. Recognize that for x > 0 the identity
  arctan x + arccot x = π/2
holds. Thus, the integrand simplifies to

  (π/2) · (1/x).

Step 2. Substitute into the integral:

  I = (π/2) ∫₁^(√3) (1/x) dx.

Step 3. Evaluate the integral of 1/x:

  ∫₁^(√3) (1/x) dx = ln|x| evaluated from 1 to √3 = ln(√3) − ln(1)
               = ln(√3).

Since ln(1) = 0 and ln(√3) = (1/2) ln 3, we have

  I = (π/2) · (1/2) ln 3 = (π ln 3)/4.

Step 4. Compute the numerical approximation. Using
  π ≈ 3.1415926536 and ln 3 ≈ 1.0986122887,
we have

  I ≈ (3.1415926536 × 1.0986122887)/4 ≈ 3.4513922952/4 ≈ 0.8628480738.

Thus, the exact answer is (π ln 3)/4 and the numerical approximation is 0.8628480738.
