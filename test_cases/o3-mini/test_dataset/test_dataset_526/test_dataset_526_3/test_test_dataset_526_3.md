We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from 1 to √3 [(arctan x + arccot x)⁄x] dx.

Step 1. Notice that for x > 0 we have the identity
  arctan x + arccot x = π/2.
Thus, the integrand simplifies as
  (arctan x + arccot x)/x = (π/2)/x = π/(2x).

Step 2. Write the modified integral:
  I = (π/2) ∫ from 1 to √3 (1/x) dx.

Step 3. Evaluate the integral ∫ (1/x) dx:
  ∫ (1/x) dx = ln|x| + C,
so the definite integral becomes
  I = (π/2)[ln|x|] evaluated from 1 to √3
     = (π/2)[ln(√3) – ln(1)]
     = (π/2) ln(√3).
Since ln 1 = 0, we have
  I = (π/2) ln(√3).

Step 4. Simplify ln(√3). Recall that ln(√3) = (1/2) ln 3, so
  I = (π/2)(1/2 ln 3) = (π/4) ln 3.

Step 5. Numerical Approximation.
Using approximations: π ≈ 3.1415926536 and ln 3 ≈ 1.0986122887, we have
  I ≈ (3.1415926536/4) × 1.0986122887
     ≈ 0.7853981634 × 1.0986122887
     ≈ 0.8628401574.

Thus, the exact answer is (π/4) ln 3 and the numerical approximation is 0.8628401574.
