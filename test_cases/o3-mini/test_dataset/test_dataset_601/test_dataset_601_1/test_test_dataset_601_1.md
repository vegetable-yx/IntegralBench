We start with the integral

  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ (arctan x)/x dx.

Step 1. Apply a substitution: Let t = 1/x. Then x = 1/t and dx = –dt/t². When x changes from 1/4 to 4 the corresponding t changes from 4 to 1/4. Thus, we have

  I = ∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) [arctan(1/t)]/(1/t) · (–dt/t²)
    = ∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) (t · arctan(1/t)) · (–dt/t²)
    = –∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) arctan(1/t) dt/t.

Reversing the limits (which changes the sign) gives

  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ arctan(1/t) dt/t.

Step 2. Notice that we now have two representations for I:
  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ [arctan x]/x dx    (1)
  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ [arctan(1/x)]/x dx   (2)
(where we replaced t with x in the second integral).

Adding equations (1) and (2):

  2I = ∫₁/₄⁴ {arctan x + arctan(1/x)} / x dx.

Step 3. Use the identity for positive x:

  arctan x + arctan(1/x) = π/2  (for x > 0).

Thus,

  2I = ∫₁/₄⁴ (π/2)/x dx = (π/2) ∫₁/₄⁴ 1/x dx.

The antiderivative of 1/x is ln|x|. Therefore,

  ∫₁/₄⁴ 1/x dx = ln x |₁/₄⁴ = ln(4) − ln(1/4) = ln(4) + ln(4) = ln(16) = 4 ln2.

Thus,

  2I = (π/2) (4 ln2) = 2π ln2,
  I = π ln2.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
  π ≈ 3.1415926536 and ln2 ≈ 0.6931471806, so
  I ≈ 3.1415926536 × 0.6931471806 ≈ 2.1775860903.
