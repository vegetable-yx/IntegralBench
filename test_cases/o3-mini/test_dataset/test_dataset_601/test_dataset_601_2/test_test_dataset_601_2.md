We wish to compute
  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ (arctan(x)/x) dx.

Step 1. We start with the substitution x → 1/x. Let t = 1/x. Then
  dx = –dt/t².
When x = 1/4, t = 4 and when x = 4, t = 1/4. Thus,

  I = ∫ₓ₌₁/₄⁴ (arctan(x)/x) dx
     = ∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) [arctan(1/t)/(1/t)] · (–dt/t²)
     = –∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) arctan(1/t) · t · (1/t²) dt
     = –∫ₜ₌₄^(1/4) [arctan(1/t)/t] dt.
Reversing the limits gives
  I = ∫ₜ₌₁/₄⁴ [arctan(1/t)/t] dt.

Step 2. Note that for x > 0 one has the identity
  arctan(x) + arctan(1/x) = π/2.
This allows us to write
  arctan(1/x) = π/2 – arctan(x).

So we now have two expressions for I:
  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ [arctan(x)/x] dx                          (1)
  I = ∫₁/₄⁴ [ (π/2 – arctan(x)) / x ] dx                   (2)

Add equations (1) and (2) to obtain
  2I = ∫₁/₄⁴ { arctan(x) + [π/2 – arctan(x)] }/x dx
     = ∫₁/₄⁴ (π/2)/x dx
     = (π/2) ∫₁/₄⁴ (1/x) dx.

Step 3. Evaluate the integral
  ∫₁/₄⁴ (1/x) dx = ln|x| ∣ from x = 1/4 to 4 = ln(4) – ln(1/4) = ln(4/(1/4)) = ln(16).
Since ln(16) = 4 ln 2, we have

  2I = (π/2) (4 ln 2) = 2π ln 2  ⟹  I = π ln 2.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

Using numerical values:
  π ≈ 3.1415926536 and ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
we get

  I ≈ 3.1415926536 × 0.6931471806 ≈ 2.1775860903.

Thus, the final answer is

{"answer": "\\pi \\ln 2", "numerical_answer": "2.1775860903"}
