We begin with the integral

  I = ∫ from -1 to 1 [1/(3^x + 1)] dx.

Step 1. Define
  f(x) = 1/(3^x + 1).
Notice that if we consider f(-x), we find
  f(-x) = 1/(3^(-x) + 1) = 1/((1/3^x) + 1) = 3^x/(1 + 3^x).

Step 2. Add f(x) and f(-x):
  f(x) + f(-x) = 1/(3^x + 1) + 3^x/(3^x + 1) = (1 + 3^x)/(3^x + 1) = 1.

Step 3. Now, integrate over the symmetric interval [-1, 1]:
  ∫ from -1 to 1 [f(x) + f(-x)] dx = ∫ from -1 to 1 1 dx.
Since f(x) and f(-x) are simply symmetric versions of each other, we have:
  ∫ from -1 to 1 [f(x) + f(-x)] dx = 2∫ from -1 to 1 f(x) dx = 2I.
But the right-hand side integral is:
  ∫ from -1 to 1 1 dx = 2.
Thus, 2I = 2 which implies that I = 1.

Step 4. Therefore, the exact value of the integral is 1.

Step 5. A numerical approximation of 1 is 1.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
