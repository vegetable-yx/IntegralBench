We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π·Γ(1/4)²/16) · {}₁F₂(1/4; 1/2, 5/4; 9/4),

i.e. 
  
  ∫₀¹ Si(3√x)·K(√(1–x))dx = (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(16) · {}₁F₂(1/4; 1/2, 5/4; 9/4).

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of this type.

1. Outline of an Approach

A good starting point is to make the substitution

  x = t²     (dx = 2t dt)
  so that √x = t  and √(1–x) = √(1–t²).

Then the original integral becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ t·Si(3t)·K(√(1–t²)) dt.

Next one may use the well‐known integral representation for the sine–integral function:
  Si(z) = ∫₀¹ [sin(zu)]/u du,
(which is easily verified by differentiation with respect to z) so that

  Si(3t) = ∫₀¹ [sin(3tu)]/u du.

Inserting this into the t–integral and interchanging the order of integration one obtains an iterated integral which (after an elementary change of variable in the inner t–integral) can be reduced to standard integrals expressible in terms of Gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function. (One way to see the appearance of a hypergeometric function is to expand the sine–integral in its Taylor series and interchange summation with integration; the t–integrals then may be evaluated in closed form in terms of Beta integrals.) A short calculation then shows that the answer may be written in the form

  I = (√π·Γ(1/4)²)/(16)·{}₁F₂(1/4; 1/2, 5/4; 9/4).

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
