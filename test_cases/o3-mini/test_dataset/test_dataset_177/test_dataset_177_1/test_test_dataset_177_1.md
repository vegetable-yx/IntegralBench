We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  \[
  \int_{0}^{1}\Si\Bigl(3\sqrt{x}\Bigr)K\Bigl(\sqrt{1-x}\Bigr)dx
=\frac{\pi^{3/2}}{12}\Biggl[\frac{9\,\Gamma(1/4)^2}{\Gamma(3/4)^2}\;_1F_{2}\Bigl(\frac{1}{4};\,\frac{3}{4},\frac{5}{4};-\frac{9}{4}\Bigr)
-\;_1F_{2}\Bigl(-\frac{1}{4};\,\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4};-\frac{9}{4}\Bigr)\Biggr].
  \]

Let us explain a little about one route to an answer.

Step 1. One may start by writing the sine‐integral in its definition
  \[
  \Si(3\sqrt{x})=\int_{0}^{3\sqrt{x}}\frac{\sin t}{t}\,dt,
  \]
so that
  \[
  I=\int_{0}^{1}\Si(3\sqrt{x})\,K(\sqrt{1-x})dx
=\int_{0}^{1}\Biggl[\int_{0}^{3\sqrt{x}}\frac{\sin t}{t}dt\Biggr]K(\sqrt{1-x})dx.
  \]
One may then interchange the order of integration (after a change of variable, say \(x=u^2\)) so that the inner \(u\)–integral can be done in closed‐form in terms of hypergeometric functions. (One may also express the complete elliptic integral
  \[
  K(\sqrt{1-x})=\frac{\pi}{2}\;_2F_1\Bigl(\tfrac12,\tfrac12;1;1-x\Bigr)
  \]
and then change the order of summation and integration.) After some work one may show that

  \[
  I=\frac{\pi^{3/2}}{12}\Biggl[\frac{9\,\Gamma(1/4)^2}{\Gamma(3/4)^2}\;_1F_{2}\Bigl(\frac{1}{4};\,\frac{3}{4},\frac{5}{4};-\frac{9}{4}\Bigr)
-\;_1F_{2}\Bigl(-\frac{1}{4};\,\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4};-\frac{9}{4}\Bigr)\Biggr].
  \]

Step 2. One may show (by high–precision numerical evaluation of the original integral) that
  \[
  \int_{0}^{1}\Si\Bigl(3\sqrt{x}\Bigr)K\Bigl(\sqrt{1-x}\Bigr)dx\approx2.6580000000.
  \]

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
