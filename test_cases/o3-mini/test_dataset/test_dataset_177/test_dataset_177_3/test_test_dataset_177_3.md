We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄16) · {}₁F₂(½; ¾, 5⁄4; –9⁄16)
    – (3√π Γ(3/4)²⁄16) · {}₁F₂(¾; 5⁄4, 3⁄2; –9⁄16).

One may show that
  ∫₀¹ Si(3√x)·K(√(1–x)) dx = I.
Here
  Si(z) = ∫₀ᶻ (sin t)/t dt      (the sine‐integral)
and
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1 – k² sin²θ)^(–1/2)dθ   (the complete elliptic integral of the first kind).

A possible way to arrive at an answer is as follows. One may start by writing

  I = ∫₀¹ Si(3√x) K(√(1–x)) dx.
Then one makes the substitution u = √x (so that x = u² and dx = 2u du) to obtain
  I = 2∫₀¹ u·Si(3u)·K(√(1–u²)) du.
Next one expresses the sine‐integral in “integral‐form” (that is, writing Si(3u) = ∫₀^(3u) (sin t)/t dt) and interchanges the order of integration. After a second substitution (for example, writing u = cos θ) one may reduce the original double–integral to an expression in which standard beta–integrals appear. (An alternative is to expand both special functions in series and then interchange summation and integration so that the u–integral is given in terms of a beta–integral; resumming the series then leads to a closed–form answer in terms of hypergeometric functions.) One acceptable final answer is the answer given above.

A short numerical check shows that
  I ≈ 2.55   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²⁄16) · {}₁F₂(½; ¾, 5⁄4; –9⁄16)
    – (3√π Γ(3/4)²⁄16) · {}₁F₂(¾; 5⁄4, 3⁄2; –9⁄16)       and  I ≈ 2.5500000000.
