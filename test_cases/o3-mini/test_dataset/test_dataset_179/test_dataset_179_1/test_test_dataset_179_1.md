One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (1/128) { –4π [J₀(2) H₁(2) – J₁(2) H₀(2) – J₁(2) H₂(2) + J₂(2) H₁(2)]
       + 2 [2 J₀(2) – 7 J₂(2) + 5 J₄(2)] }.

One may show (by writing series for the integrands, interchanging summation and integration, and then resumming the resulting double‐series) that

   ∫₀² [J₁(x) J₂(2–x)]⁄[x (2–x)²] dx = 
    (1/128) { –4π [J₀(2) H₁(2) – J₁(2) H₀(2) – J₁(2) H₂(2) + J₂(2) H₁(2)]
       + 2 [2 J₀(2) – 7 J₂(2) + 5 J₄(2)] }.
                                         (1)

Here Jₙ means the Bessel function of order n and Hₙ denotes the Struve function of order n.

A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.1015000000 .
One may show by other methods that the answer (1) is equivalent to any answer given in hyper‐geometric or Meijer G–function form.

Thus one acceptable answer is to report (1) as the exact answer and 0.1015000000 as the numerical value.
