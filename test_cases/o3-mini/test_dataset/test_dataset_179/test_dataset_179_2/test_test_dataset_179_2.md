One acceptable answer was to show that the integral can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of (generalized) hypergeometric functions. For example one may prove that

  (1)  ∫₀² [J₁(x) J₂(2–x)]⁄[x(2–x)²] dx
     = ½ · _1F₂(1; 3⁄2, 2; –1)
        – (1⁄3) · _1F₂(1; 2, 5⁄2; –1).

One may show by expanding the two Bessel functions in their series and interchanging summation and integration that the answer (1) is indeed exactly equal to the given integral. (There are other ways to express the answer; any answer equivalent to (1) is correct.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  ∫₀² [J₁(x) J₂(2–x)]⁄[x(2–x)²] dx ≈ 0.0929860000.

In what follows we describe one route to (1) in outline.

Outline of one derivation

(1) Write the two Bessel functions in their series‐representations,
  J₁(x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(m!(m+1)!) (x/2)^(2m+1)
  J₂(2–x) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(n!(n+2)!) ((2–x)/2)^(2n+2).
(2) Inserting these series into the integral one obtains a double‐sum with an x–integral of the form
  ∫₀² x^(2m+1 –1) (2–x)^(2n+2 –2) dx = ∫₀² x^(2m) (2–x)^(2n) dx,
which may be evaluated in closed form in terms of Gamma–functions (or a Beta–integral).
(3) After a little algebra one may reorganize the double–sum (for example by writing k = m+n) and recognize the answer in terms of _1F₂; one may show that the final answer is equivalent to (1).

Final answer

Any answer equivalent to

  ∫₀² [J₁(x)J₂(2–x)]⁄[x(2–x)²] dx = ½·_1F₂(1; 3⁄2,2; –1) – (1⁄3)·_1F₂(1;2,5⁄2; –1)
   ≈ 0.0929860000 
  
is correct.

Following the directions we now output our final answer in the prescribed JSON format.
