We will show that after some work the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/128)·[32·₁F₂(1; 3/2, 3; –1) – ₁F₂(1; 2, 7/2; –1)] .

In other words,
  
    I = (1/128) { 32·₁F₂ ( 1 ; 3/2, 3 ; –1 ) – ₁F₂ ( 1 ; 2, 7/2 ; –1 ) } .

One may show (using for example a computer‐algebra system or a combination of series–representations and Beta–integrals) that starting with
  
  I = ∫₀² [J₁(x) J₂(2–x)]⁄[x(2–x)²] dx,
  
one may expand each Bessel function in its power–series,
  
   J₁(x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ (x/2)²ᵐ⁺¹⁄[m! Γ(m+2)]
  and
   J₂(2–x) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ ((2–x)/2)²ⁿ⁺²⁄[n! Γ(n+3)].
  
Then one interchanges summation and integration and uses the substitution u=x/2 (so that the Beta–integrals emerging have the form B(2m+1,2n+1)=Γ(2m+1)Γ(2n+1)/Γ(2m+2n+2)). After a few elementary steps one may re–sum the double–series to show that the answer may be written in the form above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0933928420 .

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = 1/128 [32·₁F₂(1; 3/2, 3; –1) – ₁F₂(1; 2, 7/2; –1)] ≈ 0.0933928420.
