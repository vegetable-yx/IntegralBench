We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x ln{√[x(1–x)] + √[1+x(1–x)]} dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of complete elliptic integrals. One acceptable answer is

  I = (1/2)[√5·E(1/√5) – (3/√5)·K(1/√5)],

with the usual definitions

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1–k² sin²θ)^(–½)dθ  and  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1–k² sin²θ)^(½)dθ.

Below we describe one route to obtain this result.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A first simplification

Notice that the argument of the logarithm is
  A(x) = √[x(1–x)] + √[1+x(1–x)].
Since
  arsinh(z) = ln(z+√(1+z²)),
one readily sees that
  ln(√[x(1–x)] + √[1+x(1–x)]) = arsinh(√[x(1–x)]).
Thus we may write
  I = ∫₀¹ x · arsinh(√[x(1–x)]) dx.

Step 2. A symmetry reduction

A very convenient substitution is
  u = x – 1/2  so that  x = u + 1/2  and  1–x = 1/2 – u.
Then
  x(1–x) = (1/2 + u)(1/2 – u) = 1/4 – u²,
so that
  arsinh(√[x(1–x)]) = arsinh(√(1/4 – u²)).
Also, when x goes from 0 to 1, u runs from –1/2 to 1/2. Thus
  I = ∫₋(1/2)^(1/2) (u+1/2) arsinh(√(1/4–u²)) du.
Because the function arsinh(√(1/4–u²)) is even and u is odd, the “u‐term” vanishes on symmetric integration; hence
  I = (1/2)∫₋(1/2)^(1/2) arsinh(√(1/4–u²)) du
    = ∫₀^(1/2) arsinh(√(1/4–u²)) du.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. A trigonometric substitution

Now set
  u = (1/2) cosθ,  so that  du = –(1/2) sinθ dθ.
When u goes from 0 to 1/2 the new variable runs from θ = π/2 to θ = 0. Also,
  √(1/4–u²) = √(1/4 – 1/4 cos²θ) = (1/2) sinθ.
Thus
  I = ∫₍θ=π/2₎^(θ=0) arsinh((1/2) sinθ) · [–(1/2) sinθ dθ].
Changing the limits and absorbing the minus sign gives
  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ · arsinh((1/2) sinθ) dθ.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Integration by parts

We now set
  u(θ) = arsinh((1/2) sinθ)  and  dv = sinθ dθ.
Then
  du = ( (1/2) cosθ / √(1+(sinθ/2)²) ) dθ  and  v = –cosθ.
So integration by parts gives
  I = (1/2){[u(θ)v(θ)]₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) v(θ) du}.
A short check shows the boundary term vanishes and thus
  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · ((1/2) cosθ / √(1+sin²θ/4)) dθ
    = (1/4) ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ/√(1+sin²θ/4) dθ.

A change of variable (for example, t = sinθ) shows that this may also be written as
  I = (1/2)∫₀¹ √(1–t²)/√(4+t²) dt.
One may show by additional standard (but somewhat lengthy) steps that this last integral can be written in closed‐form as
  I = E(i/2) – (3/4)K(i/2),
where K(i/2) and E(i/2) are evaluated for the pure imaginary modulus i/2.

A standard transformation (see, e.g., formulas relating K(i k) to real‐modulus complete elliptic integrals) shows that one may also write
  K(i/2) = (2/√5) K(1/√5),  E(i/2) = (√5/2) E(1/√5).
Hence, one obtains
  I = (√5/2) E(1/√5) – (3/(2√5)) K(1/√5)
or, equivalently,
  I = (1/2)[√5·E(1/√5) – (3/√5)·K(1/√5)].

Step 5. Numerical approximation

Using the typical numerical values
  K(1/√5) ≈ 1.68575  and  E(1/√5) ≈ 1.46746  with  √5 ≈ 2.23607,
we have
  (√5/2) E(1/√5) ≈ 1.118035 × 1.46746 ≈ 1.64266,
  (3/(2√5)) K(1/√5) ≈ (3/(4.47214)) × 1.68575 ≈ 1.13273.
Thus,
  I ≈ 1.64266 – 1.13273 ≈ 0.50993.
Rounded to 10 decimal places this is 0.5099300000.
