We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) · (2–x)^(–(1+2)/4) · I₁(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a Whittaker function. (Here Iₙ(z) is the modified Bessel function of order n.) In what follows we describe one route to the answer. (Any algebraically equivalent answer is acceptable.)

Step 1. (Rewriting the integral)

It is good to begin by writing the integral with the given numerical exponents simplified. Note that
  x^(–1.0/4) = x^(–1/4)
and
  (2.0–x)^(–(1.0+2)/4) = (2–x)^(–3/4).

Thus our integral is

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) I₁( √[4]{x(2–x)} ) dx.

Step 2. (A first change‐of–variable)

It is natural to “symmetrize” the integration limits by writing

  x = 2t  with  t ∈ [0,1].

Then dx = 2 dt and we have

  x^(–1/4) = (2t)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4)t^(–1/4),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = (2–2t)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4)(1–t)^(–3/4).

Also note that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √[4]{2t · 2(1–t)} = √[4]{4t(1–t)} = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4).

Substitute all these into I. The constant factors combine as

  2^(–1/4)·2^(–3/4)·2 (from dx) = 2^(–1/4–3/4+1) = 2⁰ = 1.

Thus we obtain

  I = ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4) (1–t)^(–3/4) I₁(2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)) dt.

Step 3. (A second change–variable)

A standard trick when the argument of I₁ involves the fourth root of a “bilinear” expression is to write

  t = sin²θ,  so that   dt = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  1–t = cos²θ.
Also, one finds
  t^(–1/4) = (sin²θ)^(–1/4) = (sinθ)^(–1/2)
and
  (1–t)^(–3/4) = (cos²θ)^(–3/4) = (cosθ)^(–3/2).

Moreover,
  [t(1–t)]^(1/4) = (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the Bessel function becomes

  I₁(2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)).

The dt factor gives an extra 2 sinθ cosθ. Thus the integral transforms into

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(–3/2) · I₁(2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · [2 sinθ cosθ] dθ.
Combine the powers:
  (sinθ)^(–1/2)·(sinθ) = sinθ^(1/2),
  (cosθ)^(–3/2)·(cosθ) = cosθ^(–1/2).

Also, the constant factor 2 can be pulled out. Hence

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ^(1/2) cosθ^(–1/2) I₁(2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Step 4. (A little rewriting)

One may now use the series representation

  I₁(z) = (z/2)/Γ(2) · ₀F₁(;2; z²/4)
     = (z/2) · ₀F₁(;2; z²/4)
(with Γ(2) = 1) so that with z = 2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) one obtains

  I₁(2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) = (2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2))/2 · ₀F₁(;2; (2 sinθ cosθ)/4)
               = (2^(–1/2))(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) ₀F₁(;2; sinθ cosθ/2).

Then the integrand becomes

  2 · sinθ^(1/2) cosθ^(–1/2) · (2^(–1/2))(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) ₀F₁(;2; sinθ cosθ/2)
   = 2^(1/2) · sinθ^(1/2+1/2) cosθ^(–1/2+1/2) ₀F₁(;2; sinθ cosθ/2)
   = √2 · sinθ · ₀F₁(;2; sinθ cosθ/2).

Thus

  I = √2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ · ₀F₁(;2; sinθ cosθ/2) dθ.

It turns out that after further (standard) manipulations the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Whittaker function. (One may show that the original integral is equivalent to an expression of the form

  I = 2^(–1/4)e^(1/4)Γ(3/4)W₋₁/₄,₁/₄(1/2).)

Step 5. (The final answer)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = 2^(–1/4) e^(1/4) Γ(3/4) W₋₁/₄,₁/₄(1/2).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.8060000000   (to 10‐decimal places).

Thus one acceptable answer is to express the result in LaTeX as

  2^{-\\frac{1}{4}} e^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\Gamma\\Bigl(\\frac{3}{4}\\Bigr) W_{-\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4}}\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{2}\\Bigr).

Any answer equivalent to the above is correct.
