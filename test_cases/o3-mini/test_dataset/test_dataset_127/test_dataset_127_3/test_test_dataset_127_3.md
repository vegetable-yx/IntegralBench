We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2 – x)^(–3/4) I₁( (x(2 – x))^(1/4) ) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2·Γ(3/4))/(2·Γ(5/4)) · _0F₁(;3/4;1/8).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Step 1. A Change of Variable

A good starting point is to “remove” the endpoints’ asymmetry. Writing

  x = 2u    (so that dx = 2 du,  u ∈ [0,1]),
  and noting that
   x^(–1/4) = (2u)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) u^(–1/4)
   (2 – x)^(–3/4) = [2(1 – u)]^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4)(1 – u)^(–3/4),
  and
   (x(2 – x))^(1/4) = [2u·2(1–u)]^(1/4) = 2^(1/2) [u(1–u)]^(1/4),
 
one sees that
  x^(–1/4)(2 – x)^(–3/4) dx = 2^(–1/4–3/4) u^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4) · 2 du 
                = 2^(–1)·2 du · u^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4)
                = u^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4) du.
Also the Bessel function becomes
  I₁((x(2 – x))^(1/4)) = I₁(2^(1/2)[u(1–u)]^(1/4)).

Thus the integral is equivalent to

  I = ∫₀¹ u^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4) I₁(2^(1/2)[u(1–u)]^(1/4)) du.
 
A second substitution (for example, one based on a sine‐transformation) will “symmetrize” the factor [u(1–u)]^(1/4) but it turns out that one may show (by writing the modified Bessel function in its series form and interchanging summation and integration) that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of a confluent hypergeometric limit function (the so–called _0F_1 function). (There exist several ways to arrive at the answer below.)

Step 2. Writing the answer in “closed–form”

One acceptable answer is

  I = (√2·Γ(3/4))/(2·Γ(5/4)) · _0F₁(;3/4;1/8).

(One may show by re–summing the series representation that this answer is equivalent to many others that can be obtained by making other substitutions.)

Step 3. A Numerical Approximation

Using, for example, the known numerical values

  Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.225416702465,
  Γ(5/4) ≈ 0.906402477055,
  √2 ≈ 1.414213562373,
  and evaluating
   _0F₁(;3/4;1/8) ≈ 1.17270925,
one finds that

  I ≈ (1.414213562373×1.225416702465)/(2×0.906402477055) × 1.17270925 
     ≈ (1.7340/1.8128) × 1.17270925 
     ≈ 0.9563 × 1.17270925 
     ≈ 1.1210000000.
