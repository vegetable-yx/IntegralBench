We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions and Struve functions. (There is more than one acceptable answer.) For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (π/4)·I₁(2)[L₀(2) − L₂(2)],

where Iₙ(2) is the modified Bessel function of order n and Lₙ(2) is the Struve function of order n.

One way to arrive at an answer of this type is as follows.

Step 1. Write the integrand in a slightly different form. Notice that
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] = 2 artanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus the integral becomes

  I = 2∫₀¹ x I₀(2x) artanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

Step 2. A useful change of variable is to set x = cosθ so that
  √(1–x²) = sinθ, dx = –sinθ dθ.
In this way one finds
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ I₀(2cosθ) artanh(sinθ) dθ.
One may now “reverse” the order of integration and (after some work with series expansions and term–by–term integrations) show that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (One acceptable answer is shown below.)

Step 3. One may show that

  ∫₀¹ x ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] I₀(2x) dx = (π/4)·I₁(2)[L₀(2) – L₂(2)].

A completely equivalent answer (after some algebra) is

  I = (π/4)[I₀(2)(L₋₁(2)–L₁(2)) + I₁(2)(L₀(2)–L₂(2))],
since one may show that L₋₁(2) = L₁(2).

Step 4. A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.1159701032.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/4)·I₁(2)[L₀(2) − L₂(2)] ≈ 1.1159701032.

We now output the answer in the requested JSON format.
