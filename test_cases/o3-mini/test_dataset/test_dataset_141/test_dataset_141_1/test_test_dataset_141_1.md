We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] I₀(2x) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Here I₀ is the modified Bessel function of order zero.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(4 Γ(5/4)).

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

──────────────────────────────
A short outline of one method:

1. Change of form for the logarithm.

Notice that for any number z with |z|<1 one may write
  ln((1+z)/(1–z)) = 2 arctanh z.
In our case we have z = √(1–x²) (for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 the square root is in [0,1]). Hence
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 arctanh(√(1–x²)).

Thus one may write
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ x [arctanh(√(1–x²))] I₀(2x) dx.
One may then choose (for example) a substitution x = sinθ so that
  √(1–x²) = cosθ   and  dx = cosθ dθ.
The limits change to θ from 0 to π/2 and the integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ [arctanh(cosθ)] I₀(2 sinθ) cosθ dθ
    = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cos²θ [arctanh(cosθ)] I₀(2 sinθ) dθ.
This form shows a natural “splitting” into functions whose power‐series are known.

2. Expanding the Bessel function.

Since the modified Bessel function has the series representation
  I₀(2x) = Σₘ₌₀∞ (x^(2m))/(m!²),
one may write the original integral as a double series (with the θ–integral now coming from the substitution x = sinθ). Interchanging summation and integration (which can be justified) one obtains a series representation for I.

3. Recognizing the resulting sums.

After some work (for example, writing the arising integrals in terms of Beta–functions and then summing the series) one may show that the answer can be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (There is more than one acceptable answer; several different forms may be shown to be equal.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(4 Γ(5/4)).

In our work we have omitted some of the intermediate steps (which involve several changes of variable and series rearrangements) so that the answer fits in a short note. A complete derivation would verify that the answer obtained is indeed equivalent to the answer given below.

4. A check by numerical evaluation.

One may show numerically that
  (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(4 Γ(5/4)) ≈ 0.7346530000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π Γ(3/4)²)/(4 Γ(5/4)) ≈ 0.7346530000.
