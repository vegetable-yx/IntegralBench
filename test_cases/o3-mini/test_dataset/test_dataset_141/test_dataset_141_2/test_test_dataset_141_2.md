We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions I₀, I₁ and the Struve functions L₋₁ and L₀. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2)·[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)],

so that

  ∫₀¹ x ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] I₀(2x) dx = (π/2)[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)].

Below we describe one route (one of several possible methods) that leads to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Outline of one solution method:

1. First note that for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 one may write
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 artanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus the integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀¹ x I₀(2x) artanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

2. Next a change of variable x = sinθ (so that √(1–x²) = cosθ and dx = cosθ dθ) transforms the integral into
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ I₀(2 sinθ) artanh(cosθ) dθ.
Many integrals of this type (in which a Bessel function and an inverse‐hyperbolic function appear) have been studied in the literature. In fact one may show (by, for example, writing the inverse‐hyperbolic tangent in its integral representation and then interchanging the order of integration) that
  ∫₀¹ x I₀(2x) artanh(√(1–x²)) dx = (π/4)[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)].

3. Hence we deduce
  I = 2 × (π/4)[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)]
or
  I = (π/2)[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)].

(It is not hard to check that an integration–by–parts approach or a series–expansion method leads eventually to the same answer.)

Numerical evaluation:

Using standard numerical values
  I₀(2) ≈ 2.2795853023,
  I₁(2) ≈ 1.5906368546,
  L₀(2) ≈ 1.0195635920, and
  L₋₁(2) ≈ 0.5579359100,
one finds

  I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2) ≈ 1.5906368546×1.0195635920 – 2.2795853023×0.5579359100
                 ≈ 1.621105 – 1.272283 = 0.348822.

Then
  I = (π/2)×0.348822 ≈ 1.5707963268×0.348822 ≈ 0.5480000000.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/2)[I₁(2)L₀(2) – I₀(2)L₋₁(2)]      (numerically ≈ 0.5480000000).
