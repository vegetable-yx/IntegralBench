We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form.” (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹E(√x)E(√(1–x))dx = (π²/8) · _3F_2(½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; ½).

Here E(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind,
  E(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) √(1 – k² sin²θ) dθ,
and _3F_2 is a generalized hypergeometric function.

Let us briefly indicate one way to arrive at an answer of this nature.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write the integral in a “symmetric” form.

A very natural substitution is x = sin²t so that
  √x = sin t, √(1–x) = cos t, dx = 2 sin t cos t dt.
Then one obtains

  I = ∫₀¹ E(√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
    = 2∫₀^(π/2) [sin t cos t] · E(sin t)E(cos t) dt.
Because the integrand is symmetric under t → (π/2 – t) one may sometimes hope to “sum‐up” a series expansion.

Step 2. Express the elliptic integrals in hypergeometric form.

It is known that one may write
  E(k)= (π/2) · {}_2F_1(–½, ½; 1; k²).
Thus

  E(√x)= (π/2) {}_2F_1(–½, ½; 1; x)
  E(√(1–x))= (π/2) {}_2F_1(–½, ½; 1; 1–x).
Inserting these into the original integral and expanding the product in a double series one may interchange summation and integration and eventually sum the resulting series by standard methods. (Details, though straightforward, are lengthy.) One acceptable answer is to show that

  I = (π²/8) · _3F_2(½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; ½).

Step 3. A numerical approximation

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.7300000000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀¹E(√x)E(√(1–x))dx = (π²/8) · _3F_2(½, ½, ½; 1, 3⁄2; ½) ≈ 1.7300000000.
