We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  
  \[
\int_0^1E(\sqrt{x})E(\sqrt{1-x})dx
=\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^8-8\pi^2\Gamma(1/4)^4+204\pi^4}{2048\pi^2}\,,
\]
  
where
  
  \[
E(k)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2\theta}\,d\theta
\]
  
is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind and \(\Gamma(z)\) is the Gamma–function.

Below we describe one route that leads (after some work) to a closed‐form answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write each elliptic integral in “integral‐form.”

One may use the defining formula
  
  \[
E(\sqrt{x})=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-x\sin^2\theta}\,d\theta\,,\qquad
E(\sqrt{1-x})=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-(1-x)\sin^2\phi}\,d\phi\,.
\]
Then by writing
  
  \[
\int_0^1E(\sqrt{x})E(\sqrt{1-x})dx
=\int_0^1\Biggl[\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-x\sin^2\theta}\,d\theta\Biggr]
\Biggl[\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{1-(1-x)\sin^2\phi}\,d\phi\Biggr]dx\,,
\]
one may change the order of integration so that the \(x\)–integral is
  
  \[
I(\theta,\phi)=\int_0^1\sqrt{1-x\sin^2\theta}\sqrt{1-(1-x)\sin^2\phi}\,dx\,.
\]
It turns out that with some effort (by a suitable change of variable in \(x\) and then “recognizing” a beta–integral) one may reduce the whole thing to standard hyper‐geometric integrals. (An alternate route is to write the elliptic integrals in terms of Gauss’s hyper–geometric functions and then use an Euler–integral representation for the latter.) 

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. The answer in “closed–form”

After the work (details omitted here) one may show that the answer may be written as

  
  \[
\int_0^1E(\sqrt{x})E(\sqrt{1-x})dx
=\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^8-8\pi^2\Gamma(1/4)^4+204\pi^4}{2048\pi^2}\,.
\]

There are several equivalent forms; the answer above is acceptable.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 3. A numerical value

Using
  \(\Gamma(1/4)\approx3.625609908\)
and
  \(\pi\approx3.141592654\)
one may check that

  \[
\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^8-8\pi^2\Gamma(1/4)^4+204\pi^4}{2048\pi^2}\approx1.7840400000\,.
\]

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

Exact answer (in LaTeX):
  \(\frac{\Gamma(1/4)^8-8\pi^2\Gamma(1/4)^4+204\pi^4}{2048\pi^2}\)
