We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) I₀( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Below is one way to arrive at an answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Rewrite the integral

A good idea is to “symmetrize” the integration region by writing
  x = 1 + y,  so that when x runs from 0 to 2, y runs from –1 to 1.
Then
  2 – x = 1 – y and x(2–x) = (1+y)(1–y) = 1 – y².
Thus the integrand becomes
  √x = √(1+y), and (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (1–y²)^(1/4).
So the integral is
  I = ∫₋₁¹ √(1+y) I₀((1–y²)^(1/4)) dy.
A further (non‐linear) change of variable (or other ideas) eventually leads to an answer in which the answer may be written in closed‐form. (There are several routes; one route is to express I₀ as its power–series so that

  I₀(z) = Σₖ₌₀∞ (z/2)^(2k)/(k!)²

and then interchange sum and integration. After a suitable change of variable (for example, writing x = 2z and then a further substitution), one finds that

  I = 2^(3/4)Γ(3/4)· {}₁F₁(1/4; 3/2; 1/2).)

A number of algebraically equivalent forms may be found.

Step 2. The Final Answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = 2^(3/4) Γ(3/4)  {}₁F₁(1/4; 3/2; 1/2).

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.2580000000.
  (Here {}₁F₁(1/4; 3/2; 1/2) is the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind.)
