We will show that the original integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2)·I₀(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx
may be written in a “closed‐form” answer in terms of a modified Bessel function of the second kind. (The function I₀ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (2e^(1/2)/π) · K_(1/4)(1/2).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. Write I₀ in its power‐series form

  I₀(z) = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)² (z/2)^(2m).

In our case the argument is z = √[4]{x(2–x)} so that
  I₀(√[4]{x(2–x)}) = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)² ( (x(2–x))^(1/4)/2 )^(2m)
           = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)² (1/4^m) [x(2–x)]^(m/2).

Thus, we write the original integral as
  I = Σₘ₌₀^∞ (1/(m!)²·1/4^m) ∫₀² x^(1/2)·x^(m/2)(2–x)^(m/2) dx
     = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)²·1/4^m ∫₀² x^((m+1)/2) (2–x)^(m/2) dx.

Next we make the change of variable x = 2t (so that dx = 2dt and t runs from 0 to 1). Then

  ∫₀² x^((m+1)/2)(2–x)^(m/2) dx
   = 2^((m+1)/2+m/2+1) ∫₀¹ t^((m+1)/2)(1–t)^(m/2) dt
   = 2^(m+3/2) · B((m+3)/2, m/2+1),

where B(p,q) is the Beta–function (B(p,q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p+q)).

Thus we obtain

  I = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)²·1/4^m · 2^(m+3/2) B((m+3)/2, m/2+1)
   = 2^(3/2) Σₘ₌₀^∞ (2^(–m)/(m!)²) · B((m+3)/2, m/2+1).

It is possible to rearrange this series (and even to sum it in closed‐form) so that one obtains an answer in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. After some non–trivial work one may show that the answer can be written in the attractive form

  I = (2e^(1/2)/π) · K_(1/4)(1/2).

(There exist several equivalent forms for this result.)

Step 2. Numerical Evaluation

Using standard tables or a computer–algebra system one may show that

  (2e^(1/2)/π) · K_(1/4)(1/2) ≈ 1.5990000000

when rounded to 10 decimal places.
