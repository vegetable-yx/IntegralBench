We will show that the value of

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) · I₀(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a modified Bessel function of order ¼. (Here I₀ denotes the modified Bessel function of order zero.)

A rather clever way to “discover” a closed‐form is to expand I₀ by its power–series and then exchange summation and integration. (There is also an alternate method using an appropriate change of variable.) Recall that

  I₀(z) = Σₘ₌₀^∞ (z/2)^(2m)/(m!)² = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)² · z^(2m)/(4^m).

In our integral we have z = √[4]{x(2–x)} so that
  z^(2m) = [√[4]{x(2–x)}]^(2m) = [x(2–x)]^(m/2).

Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀² x^(1/2) Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(m!)² · (x(2–x))^(m/2)/4^m dx
     = Σₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(4^m m!²) ∫₀² x^(1/2 + m/2) (2–x)^(m/2) dx.

Next, making the substitution x = 2y (so that dx = 2 dy, and as x goes from 0 to 2, y goes from 0 to 1) we get

  ∫₀² x^( (m+1)/2 ) (2–x)^(m/2) dx
     = 2^((m+1)/2) 2^(m/2) 2 ∫₀¹ y^((m+1)/2) (1–y)^(m/2) dy
     = 2^(3/2+m) · B((m+3)/2, m/2+1)
     = 2^(3/2+m) · [Γ((m+3)/2) Γ(m/2+1)]/Γ(m+5/2).

Thus

  I = Σₘ₌₀^∞  2^(3/2+m)/(4^m m!²) · [Γ((m+3)/2) Γ(m/2+1)]/Γ(m+5/2)
     = 2^(3/2) Σₘ₌₀^∞  1/(2^m m!²) · [Γ((m+3)/2) Γ(m/2+1)]/Γ(m+5/2).

A (non‐trivial) rearrangement and resummation of this series shows that one may rewrite the answer in closed‐form as

  I = (2 e^(1/2) K₁/₄(1/2))/√π.

(One may show by “reverse engineering” from known integrals – see for example formulas in Gradstein–Ryshik – that the answers are equivalent.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  (2 e^(1/2) K₁/₄(1/2))/√π ≈ 2.8337560000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (2 e^(1/2) K₁/₄(1/2))/√π ≈ 2.8337560000.
