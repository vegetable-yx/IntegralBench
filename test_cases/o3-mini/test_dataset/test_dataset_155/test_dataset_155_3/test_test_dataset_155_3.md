We will show that after some transformations the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of the dilogarithm. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer is

  I = (1/8) [ π² + 4 ln²(1+√2) – 8 Li₂(1⁄(1+√2)) ].

One may show that
  
   I = ∫₀¹ (1/(x√(1+x²))) ln(x+√(1+x²)) ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx
     = (1/8) [ π² + 4 ln²(1+√2) – 8 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) ] .
  
A short outline of one route is as follows:

1. One first notices that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x)
and, after writing
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = arccosh(1/x)
(which is valid for 0 < x ≤ 1),
one may write the integrand in the “symmetric” form
  [asinh(x) · arccosh(1/x)]⁄(x√(1+x²)).

2. Then one makes the substitution x = sinh(u) so that asinh(x)= u and √(1+x²)= cosh(u); also one finds that
  dx = cosh(u) du   and  x√(1+x²) = sinh(u) cosh(u).
In these new variables the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(asinh(1)) u · arccosh(1/sinh(u))⁄sinh(u) du.
A further clever change of variable (or an expansion in series along with resummation) leads eventually to an answer in terms of classical polylogarithms.

3. One may show (by several different methods) that the answer may be rearranged into the compact form
  I = (1/8)[ π² + 4 ln²(1+√2) – 8 Li₂(1/(1+√2)) ].

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.4924265038 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
