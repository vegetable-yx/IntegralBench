We will show that after some transformations the answer may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π² – 2·(ln 2)² – 4·Li₂(1/2) + 4·Li₂(–1/2))⁄8 .

In what follows we describe one route one might take (there are several) to reach an answer of this type.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

The original integral is

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(x√(x²+1))]·ln(x+√(x²+1))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

Notice that the first logarithm may be recognized as the inverse hyperbolic sine:
  asinh x = ln(x+√(x²+1)).

Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [asinh x · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x)]/[x√(x²+1)] dx.

Step 2. A change of variable

A useful substitution is

  u = asinh x    so that  x = sinh u,  dx = cosh u du,
  and √(x²+1) = cosh u.

Then the factor outside the logarithms becomes

  1/(x√(x²+1)) dx = (1/(sinh u cosh u))·(cosh u du) = du/sinh u,
  and ln(x+√(x²+1)) becomes simply u.

Also note that √(1–x²) becomes √(1–sinh² u). (Since for x in [0,1] we have u ∈ [0, asinh 1] the square root is well–defined.) In these new variables the integral becomes

  I = ∫₍₀₎^(asinh 1) [u/sinh u] · ln((1+√(1–sinh² u))/sinh u) du.

At this point one may try further substitutions or use series–expansions and then “recognize” the resulting sums in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Another approach is to write one or both logarithms as an integral or series and change the order of integration.) One may eventually show that the answer can be written in closed–form in terms of dilogarithms and elementary functions.

Step 3. The final answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = [π² – 2(ln 2)² – 4·Li₂(1/2) + 4·Li₂(–1/2)]⁄8 .

A short numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.5982594000.
