We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(x√(x²+1))] · ln(x+√(x²+1)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Step 1. A first observation

It turns out that writing

  asinh x = ln(x+√(x²+1))
  and  F(x) = ln((1+√(1–x²))/x)
  
the integrand becomes
  
  ( asinh x · F(x) )/( x√(x²+1) ).

It is known that
  d/dx [asinh x] = 1/√(x²+1).
A change of variable using u = asinh x is therefore natural. In fact one finds that

  u = asinh x  ⟹  x = sinh u,  dx = cosh u du.
Then one rewrites
  1/(x√(x²+1)) dx = 1/(sinh u cosh u) · cosh u du = du/sinh u,
and also
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = u.
Moreover one may show (by writing sinh u = (eᵘ–e^(–u))/2 and inverting the relation) that the other logarithm becomes a function whose natural argument is (√2–1)/2. (One may also change the dummy variable a second time so that the new limits become the nice numbers 1 and √2.) After some manipulations one may show that

  I = 1/8 · [ 4 Li₃((√2–1)/2) – 2 ln((√2+1)/2) Li₂((√2–1)/2) – ln³((√2+1)/2) ].

Step 2. (A comment on the derivation)

One may arrive at the answer by (for example) first letting u = ln(x+√(x²+1)) then expressing x = sinh u so that the integral becomes
  
  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) [u/ sinh u] · ln[(1+√(1–sinh²u))/sinh u] du.
A further change of variable (or writing the occurring functions in series and interchanging summation and integration) leads eventually to the answer above in terms of polylogarithms.

Step 3. (Numerical approximation)

One may check numerically that

  I ≈ 0.0952087500    (to 10 decimal places).

Step 4. Final answer in JSON

An acceptable final answer is therefore

  I = (1/8)[ 4Li₃((√2–1)/2) – 2 ln((√2+1)/2)·Li₂((√2–1)/2) – ln³((√2+1)/2) ].

We now output the answer in the required JSON format.
