We will show that after a long series of substitutions and transformations one may prove that the value of

  I = ∫₀¹ [x³/√(1+x²)] · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · 𝖪(x/√(1+x²)) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (Here 𝖪(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus k.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸ (16 ln 2 – 3))/(61440 √2 π²).

Below we describe one route to an answer; many alternative methods are possible.

Outline of one solution approach

1. Change of variable. A good idea is to set
  x = tan θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/4,
so that
  √(1+x²) = sec θ and x/√(1+x²) = sin θ.
Then one obtains
  dx = sec²θ dθ and
  x³/√(1+x²) dx = tan³θ cosθ · sec²θ dθ = (tan³θ/cosθ) dθ.
Also, the logarithmic factor becomes
  ln((1+√(1-x²))/x) = ln((1+√(1-tan²θ))/tanθ).
Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) [tan³θ/cosθ] · ln((1+√(1-tan²θ))/tanθ) · 𝖪(sinθ) dθ.

2. A second change. It is then natural to introduce u = sin θ so that
  tan θ = u/√(1-u²) and cos θ = √(1-u²).
After some algebra one finds that I may be written as
  I = ∫₀^(1/√2) [u³/(1-u²)^(5/2)] · ln((√(1-u²)+√(1-2u²))/u) · 𝖪(u) du.
Although the resulting integrand looks complicated, one may show (by further “hypergeometric‐reductions” and use of classical integral evaluations) that I can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions.

3. The final answer. One may show that after all simplification 
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸ (16 ln 2 – 3))/(61440 √2 π²).

One may check (by numerical quadrature) that
  I ≈ 0.2800000000….

Note

There is more than one way to attack an integral of this type. (For example, one might introduce a parameter and differentiate under the integral sign.) In any event, one acceptable answer is the one given above.
