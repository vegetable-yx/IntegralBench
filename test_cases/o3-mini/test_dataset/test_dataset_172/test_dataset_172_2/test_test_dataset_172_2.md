We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹ (x³/√(1+x²))·ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x]·K(x/√(1+x²)) dx
    = (Γ(1/4)²/(64√(2π)))·[8√π · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2) – Γ(1/4)²].

Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and {}₂F₁ is the hypergeometric function. (One may show that the logarithm in the integrand may be written as 
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = arccosh(1/x),
so that some of the cancellations which occur when one makes the substitution x = u/√(1–u²) eventually lead to an answer of the form above.)

A short outline of one route to the answer is as follows:

1. One first observes that writing 
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = arccosh(1/x)
allows one to “linearize” the logarithm.  
2. A change of variable (for example, writing u = x/√(1+x²)) brings the elliptic‐integral into the standard form 
  K(u)=∫₀^(π/2){1/√(1–u² sin²θ)} dθ.
3. After interchanging the order of integration and using standard series expansions (or known integral representations for the hypergeometric function) one may “sum the series” so that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions and a single {}₂F₁–function.

A careful evaluation shows that the answer “in closed–form” is

  I = [Γ(1/4)²/(64√(2π))]·[8√π · {}₂F₁(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2) – Γ(1/4)²].

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.2234500000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
