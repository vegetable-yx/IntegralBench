We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [x³/√(x²+1)] · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · K(x/√(x²+1)) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical constants and dilogarithms. (Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.)

In what follows a possible route (which we now describe in outline) leads to an answer equivalent to

  I = (π/8)·ln²2 – (π/16)·[Li₂(1/2) + Li₂(–1/2)] .

Because of the intrinsic difficulty of integrals that contain complete elliptic integrals in their integrands, several steps (changes of variables, series re–summation and term–by–term integration, and finally recognizing standard dilogarithm combinations) are required. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.)

A brief outline of one derivation is as follows:

1. One begins with the original integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [x³/√(1+x²)] · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) · K(x/√(x²+1)) dx.
 A very useful substitution is to set
  k = x/√(1+x²).
 Then one shows that
  x = k/√(1–k²)  and  dx = dk/(1–k²)^(3/2).
 A short calculation shows that the “algebraic” factors combine so that the differential transforms as
  [x³/√(1+x²)]dx = k³/(1–k²)^(5/2) dk.
 Also, the logarithm becomes
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln((√(1–k²)+√(1–2k²))/k)
 after a little algebra.
 Finally, the elliptic‐integral becomes K(k).

2. Thus the integration variable is changed from x to k so that the new limits become k = 0 (when x = 0) and k = 1/√2 (when x = 1). In the new variable the integral is
  I = ∫₀^(1/√2) [k³/(1–k²)^(5/2)] · ln((√(1–k²)+√(1–2k²))/k) · K(k) dk.
 Although the integrand is not “simpler” in appearance, one may now expand the complete elliptic integral in its (hypergeometric) series, exchange summation and integration, and eventually re–summate the resulting series in closed–form. (One may also use known integral representations for K(k) and properties of the dilogarithm function.)

3. After some careful work the answer may be written in closed–form as
  I = (π/8)ln²2 – (π/16)[Li₂(1/2) + Li₂(–1/2)].
 One may show (by using known functional equations for the dilogarithm) that this answer is equivalent to other answers that one may obtain by different methods.

4. A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 0.1622325592  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/8)ln²2 – (π/16)[Li₂(1/2) + Li₂(–1/2)]
   ≈ 0.1622325592

is correct.
