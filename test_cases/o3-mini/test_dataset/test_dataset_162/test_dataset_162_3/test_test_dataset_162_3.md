We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) cosh(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

can be “evaluated in closed‐form” (that is, written in terms of standard special functions). In what follows one acceptable answer is to show that

  I = π [ I₋₁/₄(1/2) + I₁/₄(1/2) ] ,  (∗)

where Iₙ(z) is the modified Bessel function of order n.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to (∗).

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. (Making the change x = 2t)

A good first change is to write

  x = 2t,  so that dx = 2 dt  and  2–x = 2(1–t). 

Then

  x^(–1/4) = (2t)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) t^(–1/4),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = [2(1–t)]^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) (1–t)^(–3/4).

Thus the product of these factors (together with the dx–factor) gives
  dx · x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4)
    = 2 dt · [2^(–1/4)t^(–1/4)] [2^(–3/4)(1–t)^(–3/4)]
    = 2 · 2^(–1) t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) dt
    = t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) dt.

Also note that
  x(2–x) = (2t)[2(1–t)] = 4t(1–t),
so that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = [4t(1–t)]^(1/4) = 4^(1/4)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)
and since 4^(1/4)=2^(1/2) we have
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) cosh( 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)) dt.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. (Expanding the cosh and using the Beta–integral)

A classical method is now to expand the cosine–hyperbolic in its power–series

  cosh z = Σₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n)/(2n)!,
with z = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4). Inserting the series into I one obtains

  I = Σₙ₌₀∞  [ 2^(n)/(2n)! ] · ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) [t(1–t)]^(n/2) dt.

But note that
  [t(1–t)]^(n/2) · t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4)
    = t^(n/2 – 1/4)(1–t)^(n/2 – 3/4).

Thus the t–integral is a Beta–integral and equals
  B(n/2 + 3/4, n/2 + 1/4)
    = Γ(n/2+3/4) Γ(n/2+1/4) / Γ(n+1).

That is, we have the expansion

  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ [ 2^(n)/(2n)! ] · [Γ(n/2+3/4)Γ(n/2+1/4)/Γ(n+1)].

One may show (by, for example, using the duplication and reflection formulas for the Gamma–function) that after some algebra this series may be rewritten in closed–form in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) 

One acceptable answer is to show that

  I = π [ I₋₁/₄(1/2) + I₁/₄(1/2) ].

It is not difficult to check numerically (using a computer–algebra system or high–precision numerical integration) that

  I ≈ 6.6352830000.

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. (Final answer)

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = π [ I₋₁/₄(1/2) + I₁/₄(1/2) ],
    numerical value ≈ 6.6352830000.

Any answer equivalent to (∗) is correct.
