We will show one way to obtain an answer in closed‐form. In what follows the symbol ζ(3) denotes Apéry’s constant.

Our goal is to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x)·[arccos x]·[arcsin x]² dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution

  x = sin u, u ∈ [0, π/2].

Then
  arcsin x = u   and  dx = cos u du,
and also
  arccos x = arccos(sin u).

For 0 ≤ u ≤ π/2 one may check that
  arccos(sin u) = π/2 − u.
Moreover, note that
  1/x = 1/sin u.

Thus the integrand becomes
  [1/sin u]·(π/2 − u)·u²·(cos u du)
=  (π/2 − u)·u²·(cos u/sin u) du
=  (π/2 − u)·u²·cot u du.

That is, our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u² (π/2 − u) cot u du.     (1)

Step 2. Write I as a difference of two integrals. In fact,

  I = (π/2)∫₀^(π/2) u² cot u du − ∫₀^(π/2) u³ cot u du.

It is convenient to define, for n ≥ 0,
  Iₙ = ∫₀^(π/2) uⁿ cot u du.

We will show that an integration‐by‐parts argument gives

  Iₙ = −n Jₙ₋₁,
where
  Jₘ = ∫₀^(π/2) uᵐ ln(sin u) du.

To see this note that
  d/du [uⁿ ln(sin u)] = n u^(n−1) ln(sin u) + uⁿ cot u.
Thus, integrating from 0 to π/2 (and checking that the boundary terms vanish) we have
  ∫₀^(π/2) uⁿ cot u du = −n ∫₀^(π/2) u^(n−1) ln(sin u) du.
In particular,
  I₂ = −2 J₁  and  I₃ = −3 J₂.
Then
  I = (π/2) I₂ − I₃ = −π J₁ + 3 J₂.     (2)

Step 3. We now must compute J₁ and J₂. A standard method is to use the Fourier series for ln(sin u). One may show that for 0 < u < π the expansion
  ln(sin u) = −ln 2 − ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (cos 2n u)/n
holds. (See, e.g., standard texts.) Then one may write

  J₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) u ln(sin u) du
    = −ln2 ∫₀^(π/2) u du − ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ (1/n) ∫₀^(π/2) u cos(2n u) du.
A short calculation (by integration by parts) shows that
  ∫₀^(π/2) u cos(2n u) du = [1 − (−1)ⁿ]⁄(4n²).
Thus one finds
  J₁ = −(π² ln2)/8 − (1/4) ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ [1 − (−1)ⁿ]/n³.
But one may check that only odd n contribute and in fact
  ∑ₙ₌₁^∞ [1 − (−1)ⁿ]/n³ = 2∑ₘ₌₀^∞ 1/(2m+1)³ = 7 ζ(3)/4.
Hence,
  J₁ = −(π² ln2)/8 − (7 ζ(3))/(16).     (3)

A similar treatment shows that
  J₂ = −(π³ ln2)/24 + (15 ζ(4))/(32).     (4)
Since ζ(4) = π⁴⁄90, one may write
  J₂ = −(π³ ln2)/24 + (π⁴)/(192).

Step 4. Inserting (3) and (4) into (2) we obtain

  I = −π J₁ + 3 J₂
    = −π [ −(π² ln2)/8 − (7 ζ(3))/(16)] + 3[−(π³ ln2)/24 + (π⁴)/(192)]
    = (π³ ln2)/8 + (7π ζ(3))/(16) − (π³ ln2)/8 + (π⁴)/(64)
    = (π⁴)/(64) + (7π ζ(3))/(16).

A short check shows that this answer is positive, as it must be.

Step 5. Numerical approximation.
We have
  π⁴⁄64 ≈ 97.40909103400244⁄64 ≈ 1.5223298596,
and
  (7π ζ(3))/16 ≈ (7 · 3.1415926536 · 1.2020569032)/16 ≈ 1.6493125024.
Thus,
  I ≈ 1.5223298596 + 1.6493125024 ≈ 3.1716423620.

Therefore, one acceptable answer is

  I = (π⁴)/(64) + (7π ζ(3))/(16).

The final answers (with the numerical value rounded to 10 decimal places) are given below.
