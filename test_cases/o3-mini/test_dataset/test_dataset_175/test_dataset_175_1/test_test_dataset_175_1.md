We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/16) · [π² – 8 · {}₃F₂(½,½,½; 1,3/2; 1/4)],

i.e.
  
    I = (π/16) [π² – 8 ₃F₂(½,½,½; 1,3/2; 1/4)].

One may show that (by a suitable change of variable and “symmetrizing” the interval) the given integral

  I = ∫₀² √x √(2–x) · (arcsin(0.5√(x(2–x))))² dx

may be transformed (first letting, for example, x = 1–cosθ and then also using the substitution x = 2 sin²φ) to an equivalent integral
  
  I = ∫₀^π sin²u [arcsin(½ sin u)]² du,
  
which (after some further work – for example, writing out the power–series for the arcsine and recombining the resulting Beta–integrals) may be summed in closed‐form in terms of a hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A short outline of one derivation is as follows:

1. First set  x = 1 – cosθ. Then
  √x√(2–x) = √[(1–cosθ)(1+cosθ)] = sinθ,
  dx = sinθ dθ,
so that the original integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^π sin²θ (arcsin(0.5 sinθ))² dθ.

2. By symmetry one may show that
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin²θ (arcsin(0.5 sinθ))² dθ.

3. (An alternative change of variable is to let x = 2 sin²φ; then one eventually obtains)
  I = ∫₀^π sin²u (arcsin(½ sin u))² du.

A little more work shows that the answer can be written as

  I = (π/16) · [π² – 8 ₃F₂(½,½,½; 1,3/2; 1/4)].

A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 0.3317000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer stated below is correct.
