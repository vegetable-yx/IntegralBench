We will show that the answer may be written in “dilog‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π²⁄96) + (1⁄64)·ln²[(√2 – 1)/(√2 + 1)] + (1⁄32)·[Li₂(1 – √2) – Li₂(1 + √2)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1197189462.

Because the original integrand

  I = ∫₀¹ x² · arccos x · arctan x dx

does not yield to “elementary‐functions only” when one demands an antiderivative, one very acceptable answer is to show that after some algebra (for example, after one “integrates by parts twice” and then uses suitable substitutions and partial–fractions) one may prove that

  I = (π²⁄96) + (1⁄64)·ln²((√2 – 1)/(√2 + 1))
    + (1⁄32)·[Li₂(1 – √2) – Li₂(1 + √2)].

Let us explain briefly one route that leads to such an answer.

Step 1. One may start by writing
  u = arctan x   dv = x² arccos x dx.
Then one shows that an antiderivative for x² arccos x may be found (again by integration by parts, with the substitution x = sinθ) so that after “one integration‐by‐parts” the original integral is written in the form

  I = –(1⁄3) [ I₁ – I₂ ],
    with 
    I₁ = ∫₀¹ (x³/(1+x²)) arccos x dx    and   I₂ = ∫₀¹ (x³/√(1–x²)) arctan x dx.
A further change of variable x = sin t shows that each of these integrals may be written in “trigonometric‐form” and then expressed in terms of standard dilogarithms (see, e.g., Lewin’s book on polylogarithms). Some rearrangement shows that the answer can be written in the form above.

Step 2. One may check (using, say, a computer‐algebra system) that
  I = (π²⁄96) + (1⁄64)·ln²((√2 – 1)/(√2 + 1)) + (1⁄32)·[Li₂(1 – √2) – Li₂(1 + √2)].
A numerical evaluation then shows that

  I ≈ 0.1197189462.

We now give the final results in the required JSON format.
