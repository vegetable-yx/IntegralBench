We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = ( –6 + 6√2 + π(3√2 – 4) + 6Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – 6Li₂(1 – √2) + 8 ln2 (√2 – 1) )⁄48,

so that numerically
  I ≈ 0.2002526003.

In what follows we describe one way of arriving at a result equivalent to the answer above.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x² · arccos x · arctan x dx .

A good idea is to “reduce” the inverse‐trigonometric functions. For example, writing

  arccos x = π/2 – arcsin x ,
  arctan x = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ x^(2m+1)/(2m+1)  (for |x| ≤ 1)
  arcsin x = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ cₙ x^(2n+1),  where cₙ = (2n)!/(4ⁿ (n!)² (2n+1)),

one may expand the product and integrate term‐by‐term. One may then show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of the dilogarithm function (Li₂) and logarithms.

A second approach is to integrate by parts. For example one may take

  u = arccos x  and dv = x² arctan x dx.
Then one finds (after a little work) that
  I = ∫₀¹ [x³⁄3 · arctan x – (x² – ln(1+x²))/6] 1/√(1–x²) dx.
A substitution x = sinθ transforms the answer into
  I = 1⁄3 ∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ · arctan(sinθ) dθ – 1⁄6 ∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ – ln(1+ sin²θ)] dθ.
After some further work the answer may be shown to be equivalent to
  I = ( –6 + 6√2 + π(3√2 – 4) + 6Li₂(1–1/√2) – 6Li₂(1–√2) + 8 ln2 (√2–1) )⁄48.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.

Step 2. Final answer

We now state our final answer. One acceptable answer is

  I = ( –6 + 6√2 + π(3√2 – 4) + 6Li₂(1–1/√2) – 6Li₂(1–√2) + 8 ln2 (√2–1) )⁄48 ,
with numerical value I ≈ 0.2002526003.
