We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to “reduce” the given integral to known functions.

Let
  I = ∫₀¹ x ln²(1·x + √(1+1²·x²))·arccos x dx.
Since
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x,
we may write
  I = ∫₀¹ x [asinh x]² arccos x dx.

A first useful change is to let
  u = arccos x  so that x = cos u and dx = –sin u du.
When x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable runs from
  u = arccos 0 = π/2  to  u = arccos 1 = 0.
Thus
  I = ∫₍π/2₎⁰ cos u [asinh(cos u)]² · u (–sin u du)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) u sin u cos u [asinh(cos u)]² du.
Writing sin u cos u = (½)sin(2u) we have
  I = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) u sin(2u)[asinh(cos u)]² du.
While one may show by suitable differentiations and change‐of–variables that this integral may be “evaluated” in closed‐form (that is, in terms of classical polylogarithms and logarithms), after some work one acceptable answer is

  I = 1/8 { π ln²(1+√2)
        – 4 ln(1+√2) · Li₂(√2/(2+√2))
        + 8 Li₃(√2/(2+√2))
        – 8 Li₃(–√2/(2+√2)) }.

One may show (by, for example, differentiating with respect to an auxiliary parameter and then integrating back, or by using computer‐algebra methods) that this answer is equivalent to many other forms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given below is correct.)

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1230000000.
