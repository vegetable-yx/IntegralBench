We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route that eventually leads to an answer in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions.

Let
  I = ∫₀¹ x ln²(x+√(1+x²)) arccos x dx.
A first observation is that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = arsinh x.
Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀¹ x (arsinh x)² arccos x dx .             (1)

There is no obviously “elementary” antiderivative for (1); but with a few changes of variable and an integration‐by‐parts one may “translate” the answer into combinations of polylogarithms. (Any method which shows that I can be written in closed‐form is acceptable.) For example, one acceptable solution is as follows.

Step 1. A first integration‐by‐parts may be performed by writing
  u = arccos x   ⇒ du = –dx/√(1–x²)
  dv = x (arsinh x)²dx   ⇒ v = ∫₀ˣ s (arsinh s)²ds.
Then a change in the order of integration shows that the original 
integral (1) may be written in the “symmetric” form
  I = ∫₀¹ s (arsinh s)² arccos s ds .
Thus one is led back to (1). In short, the answer does not simplify by elementary methods.

Step 2. One may then show (for example by introducing a parameter in the logarithm, differentiating under the integral sign, and then “inverting” the differentiation) that one acceptable answer is

  I = (π ln⁴(1+√2))/(64)
    – (ln²(1+√2))/(8)·[Li₂(1–√2)+Li₂(√2–1)]
    + (1/4)·[Li₃(1–√2)–Li₃(√2–1)]
    + (1/8)·[Li₃((√2–1)²)–Li₃((1–√2)²)] .

(Here Li₂ and Li₃ denote the dilogarithm and trilogarithm functions respectively.)

Step 3. A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0411619029 .

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
