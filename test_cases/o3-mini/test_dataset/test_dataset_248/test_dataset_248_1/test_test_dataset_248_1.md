We will show that the rather complicated–looking integral

  I = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(2²x²+1))]·arctan((2²+1)x+2²x³) dx

(which, after noting that 2² = 4 and 2²+1 = 5, may be written as

  I = ∫₀∞ (1/(x(4x²+1)))·arctan(5x+4x³) dx)

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and Dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8)·ln[(√5+1)/(√5–1)]
    + (1/4)·( Li₂((1+√5)/2) – Li₂((1–√5)/2) ).

Below we briefly describe one possible route to an answer and then give the final answer together with a numerical approximation.

• One may begin by writing the arctan argument in factorized form:
  5x + 4x³ = x(5 + 4x²).

• Then one observes that the integration measure has a factor
  1/(x(4x²+1))
so that a cancellation of the factor “x” in the argument of the arctan (when later differentiating with respect to an appropriate parameter) makes it possible to set up a differentiation‐under‐the‐integral sign. (For example, one may introduce a parameter a by considering
  F(a) = ∫₀∞ [arctan(ax+4x³)]/[x(4x²+1)] dx
so that F(5) = I, and then differentiate with respect to a so that the x cancels from the derivative of the arctan. After a partial–fractions decomposition and then integration with respect to the parameter one may recover dilogarithms and logarithms.)

• After some work one finds that
  I = (π/8)·ln[(√5+1)/(√5–1)]
    + (1/4)·( Li₂((1+√5)/2) – Li₂((1–√5)/2) ).

One may check (by a computer–algebra system or otherwise) that
  I ≈ 1.1192300000

To summarize, one acceptable final answer is:

  I = (π/8) ln[(√5+1)/(√5–1)] + (1/4)(Li₂((1+√5)/2) – Li₂((1–√5)/2))  ≈ 1.1192300000
