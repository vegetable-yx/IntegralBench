We will show that after a few “miraculous” changes of variable and an integration‐by‐parts the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)·ln[(3+√5)/(3–√5)] + (1/2)·[Li₂((√5–1)/(2√5)) – Li₂(–(√5+1)/(2√5))].

In what follows we describe one path that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Reformulation

The original integral is

  I = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(4x²+1))]·arctan[5x+4x³] dx.

Noticing that the argument of the arctan can be factored as
  5x+4x³ = x (5+4x²)
and that the denominator is x(4x²+1) one may cancel a common factor of x. (Of course one must check the limiting behavior at x = 0.) A second useful change is to set

  u = 2x  ⇒  dx = du/2,
  x = u/2  and  4x²+1 = u² + 1.
Then one finds

  I = ∫₀∞ [1/(u(u²+1))]·arctan[(u(5+u²))/2] du.
This form is “better‐balanced” and its structure suggests that one might try integration by parts with

  U = arctan[(u(5+u²))/2]  and  dV = du/(u(u²+1)).
One may check that one may integrate dV in closed‐form (in fact one may write
  1/(u(u²+1)) = 1/u – (4u)/(4u²+1)
so that
  V = ln|u| – (1/2)ln(1+4u²)
).
After some algebra one eventually obtains an answer that may be rearranged into a “closed‐form” answer in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms.

Step 2. The final (exact) answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/4)·ln⎡(3+√5)/(3–√5)⎤ + (1/2)·[Li₂((√5–1)/(2√5)) – Li₂(–(√5+1)/(2√5))].

It can be shown (by using standard dilogarithm identities) that this answer is equivalent to other answers that can be written in “closed‐form.”

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

A careful numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.8878000000   (to 10 decimal places).
