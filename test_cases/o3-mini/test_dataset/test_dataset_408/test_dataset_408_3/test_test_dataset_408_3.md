We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (x³/(3 + 2x²)²) dx.

Step 1. Substitute u = 3 + 2x². Then,
  du/dx = 4x  ⟹  du = 4x dx  ⟹  x dx = du/4.

Note that x³ dx can be written as x² · (x dx). Also, since
  u = 3 + 2x² ⟹ x² = (u - 3)/2,
we have
  x³ dx = x² · (x dx) = ((u - 3)/2) · (du/4) = (u - 3)/(8) du.

The denominator becomes u². Also, when x = 0, u = 3, and when x = 1, u = 3 + 2(1) = 5. Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₍u=3₎⁵ [(u - 3)/(8u²)] du = (1/8) ∫₃⁵ (u - 3)/u² du.

Step 2. Express the integrand in partial fractions:
  (u - 3)/u² = u/u² - 3/u² = 1/u - 3/u².

Thus,
  I = (1/8)[∫₃⁵ (1/u) du − 3∫₃⁵ (1/u²) du].

Now, compute the integrals:
• ∫₃⁵ (1/u) du = ln|u| evaluated from 3 to 5 = ln(5) − ln(3) = ln(5/3).
• ∫₃⁵ (1/u²) du = [−1/u] evaluated from 3 to 5 = (−1/5) − (−1/3) = 1/3 − 1/5 = (5 − 3)/15 = 2/15.

Thus,
  I = (1/8)[ln(5/3) − 3*(2/15)] = (1/8)[ln(5/3) − 6/15] = (1/8)[ln(5/3) − 2/5].

Step 3. Write the final answer and obtain a numerical approximation.
The exact answer is
  I = (1/8)·(ln(5/3) − 2/5).

Now, numerically, ln(5/3) ≈ 0.5108256238 and 2/5 = 0.4. Therefore,
  ln(5/3) − 2/5 ≈ 0.5108256238 − 0.4 = 0.1108256238,
so
  I ≈ (1/8) * 0.1108256238 ≈ 0.013853202975.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, the numerical approximation is 0.0138532030.
