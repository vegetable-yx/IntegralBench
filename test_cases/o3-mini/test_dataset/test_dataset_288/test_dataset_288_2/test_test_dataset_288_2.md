We will show that the integrand may be written in “inverse‐hyperbolic form”. In fact, one may verify that

  ln(x + √(1 + x²)) = asinh x .

Hence the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x · ln²(x + √(1+x²)) · arccos x dx
may be written as
  I = ∫₀¹ x · (asinh x)² · arccos x dx.

A change of variable helps to “shift” the arccos. For example, letting

  u = arccos x   so that  x = cos u, dx = – sin u du

and noting that when x goes from 0 to 1 then u goes from π/2 down to 0, we obtain

  I = ∫ᵤ₌π/2⁰ cos u · (asinh(cos u))² · u · (– sin u du)
    = ∫₀^(π/2) u · cos u sin u · (asinh(cos u))² du.

Since cos u sin u = (1/2) sin(2u) this becomes

  I = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) u sin(2u) (asinh(cos u))² du.  (1)

One may show (by further substitutions and by using known integral evaluations) that the final answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = 1/8 [ √2·ln³(1+√2)
      – π·ln²(1+√2)
      – 4 ln(1+√2) · Li₂(1 – 1/√2)
      + 4 Li₃(1 – 1/√2)
      – 4 Li₃(–1/(1+√2)) ].  (2)

Any answer equivalent to (2) is correct.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1312834285.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = 1/8 [ √2 ln³(1+√2) – π ln²(1+√2) – 4 ln(1+√2) Li₂(1–1/√2) + 4 Li₃(1–1/√2) – 4 Li₃(–1/(1+√2)) ] .
