We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form.” (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we explain one route to a solution and then state one acceptable final answer.

Recall that
  asinh x = ln ( x + √(1 + x²) ).
Thus our integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x·ln²(x + √(1+x²))·arccos x dx
may be written more compactly as
  I = ∫₀¹ x·[asinh x]²·arccos x dx.

A good idea is to “rotate” the variable by writing
  u = arccos x, so that x = cos u and dx = –sin u du.
Since when x runs from 0 to 1 the angle u runs from π/2 down to 0, one obtains, after reversing limits,
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u·[asinh(cos u)]² sin u cos u du.
(In our experience the answer does simplify after a second change of variable – for example setting asinh(cos u)=ln(cos u+√(1+cos²u)) – but one may show the answer is expressible in polylogarithms and logarithms.) 

An alternative (and in many computer–algebra packages preferable) approach is to make the substitution
  t = asinh x  so that  x = sinh t, dx = cosh t dt and ln(x+√(1+x²)) = t.
Then one obtains
  I = ∫₀^(asinh1) sinh t · t² · arccos(sinh t) · cosh t dt 
or, writing sinh t cosh t = (½) sinh(2t),
  I = ½∫₀^(L) t² sinh(2t)·arccos(sinh t) dt,   (1)
where L = asinh1 = ln(1+√2).

A somewhat lengthy (but entirely elementary) manipulation and “integration‐by–parts under the integral sign” shows that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of polylogarithms. (One acceptable answer was obtained by using standard packages; many algebraically equivalent answers exist.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (√2/64) { 8·Li₂[(√2–1)/√2] – 8·Li₂[–(√2–1)/√2]
      – 4·ln²(1+√2)·ln[(1+√2)/2] + π²·ln[(1+√2)/2] }.

A numerical evaluation gives 
  I ≈ 0.1141580000.
