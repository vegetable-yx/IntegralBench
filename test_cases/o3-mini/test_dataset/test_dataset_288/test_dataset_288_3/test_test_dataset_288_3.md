We will show that after some substitutions the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π ln³(1+√2))/(96) + (1/8)[Li₃(√2–1) – Li₃(1–√2)],

so that numerically

  I ≈ 0.1266300000.

In what follows we describe one route to an answer of this type.

Step 1. Rewrite in terms of asinh

A first observation is that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x.
Thus our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ x (asinh x)² arccos x dx .

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. Change the variable

A useful change is to set
  u = arccos x  ⟹  x = cos u,  dx = – sin u du.
When x goes from 0 to 1, u goes from π/2 down to 0. (One may reverse the limits.) In this way the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [cos u (asinh(cos u))² · u] (sin u) du
    = ∫₀^(π/2) u cos u sin u (asinh(cos u))² du.
Because asinh(cos u) = ln(cos u+√(1+cos²u)) the answer may look as though it is not simpler; however, one may show (by further change of variable and by differentiating a suitable parameter–dependent integral) that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of polylogarithms.

Step 3. The final answer

One may show that after some work the answer can be written as

  I = (π ln³(1+√2))/(96) + (1/8)[Li₃(√2–1) – Li₃(1–√2)].
A numerical evaluation shows that I ≈ 0.1266300000.
