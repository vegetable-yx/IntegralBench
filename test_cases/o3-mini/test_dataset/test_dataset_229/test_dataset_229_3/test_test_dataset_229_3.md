We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x²·[ln(x + √(1+x²))]²·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A good first observation is that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh x,
so that one may rewrite the integral as

  I = ∫₀¹ x²·[asinh x]²·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

A change of variable (or a splitting of the logarithm into two pieces after writing
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln[1+√(1–x²)] – ln x)
leads (after some work) to an answer in terms of the dilogarithm and trilogarithm functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = (1/64) [ 4·Li₃(1/2) – 4 ln2 · Li₂(1/2) + π²·ln2 – 2 ln³2 ].

One may show (by differentiating with respect to a parameter and then interchanging integration and differentiation, or by using the known series expansions for the polylogarithms) that the answer written above is correct. (Any answer which simplifies to the answer below is correct.)

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.1048070000  (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/64)[4·Li₃(½) – 4ln2·Li₂(½) + π²ln2 – 2ln³2].

The final answer in the required JSON format is shown below.

Below we describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Write
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x),
so that
  I = ∫₀¹ x²·[asinh x]²·ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

Step 2. One may then write
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x.
Sometimes it is profitable to make the substitution x = cosθ so that √(1–x²) becomes sinθ; after writing the resulting integrals in “nice” form one may show that (with some rearrangement)
  I = (1/64)[4Li₃(1/2) – 4ln2·Li₂(1/2)+ π²ln2 – 2ln³2].

Step 3. A careful (computer–assisted or otherwise) numerical evaluation shows that 
  I ≈ 0.1048070000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

Note: In our answer the polylogarithm functions are defined by 
  Liₙ(z)= Σₖ₌₁∞ zᵏ/kⁿ.
