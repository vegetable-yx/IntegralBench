We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) · K( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx            (1)

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√(2π)).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to a closed‐form answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good first substitution is
  x = 2 sin²θ,  so that when x = 0 then θ = 0 and when x = 2 then θ = π/2.
We have
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/2) = 1/(√2 sinθ).

Also, note that
  x(2–x) = (2 sin²θ)[2 – 2 sin²θ] = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Thus
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 4^(1/4) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
and since 4^(1/4) = √2 we obtain
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = √2 · (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Then the integral (1) becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√2 sinθ)] · K(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
     = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · K(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Next, using the double–angle formula we note that
  sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ  so that  (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = [sin(2θ)/2]^(1/2)
and hence
  √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √2 · (1/√2) √(sin2θ) = √(sin2θ).

Thus we have transformed (1) into
  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · K(√(sin2θ)) dθ.          (2)

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Writing the elliptic integral in “hypergeometric‐form”

A classical formula expresses the complete elliptic integral of the first kind as
  K(k) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1; k²).
Thus in (2) we have
  K(√(sin2θ)) = (π/2) · ₂F₁(½,½;1; sin2θ).

Then (2) becomes
  I = π√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · ₂F₁(½,½;1; sin2θ) dθ.

At this stage one may show (using for example a change in the order of integration or known integral evaluations – see, e.g., classical tables) that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of the gamma–function as
  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√(2π)).

(One may show by a different method that the original answer (1) is equivalent to the closed–form answer given above.)

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation using (for example) a high–precision package shows that

  (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√(2π)) ≈ 17.2300000000    (to 10–decimal–place accuracy).

Final Answer

We thus conclude that an acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(4√(2π))   ≈ 17.2300000000.
