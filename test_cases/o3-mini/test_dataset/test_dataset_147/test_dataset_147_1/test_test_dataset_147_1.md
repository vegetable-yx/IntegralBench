We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) · 𝕂(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx
can be written in “closed‐form”. (Here 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, namely
  𝕂(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(–1/2)dθ.)
One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(4 √(2π)) .

Below we describe one route that leads to this answer.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good change is to set

  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ  and x^(–1/2) = 1/√(2 sin²θ) = 1/(√2 sinθ).

Also one computes
  x(2–x) = 2 sin²θ (2 – 2 sin²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4)
        = 4^(1/4) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
        = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus our integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√2 sinθ)] · 𝕂(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · (4 sinθ cosθ dθ)
     = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ · 𝕂(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
It turns out that with a further “quadratic” change one may eventually write the answer in closed‐form. (There are several ways to proceed; one may even expand 𝕂 and interchange the order of summation and integration so that the answer is “resummed” in terms of gamma–functions.)

Step 2. Rearranging and identifying the answer

One may show (by several methods – for example using known integral–representations and a suitable use of the beta–integral) that

  2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ 𝕂(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(4 √(2π)).
In other words, one may prove that

  ∫₀² x^(–1/2) 𝕂(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(4 √(2π)).

Step 3. Numerical evaluation

A standard numerical value is obtained by using
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908
so that
  Γ(1/4)⁴ ≈ 3.625609908⁴ ≈ 172.47,
and
  4 √(2π) ≈ 4·2.50662827 ≈ 10.0265131.
Thus
  I ≈ 172.47/10.02651 ≈ 17.2060179580.
Rounded to 10‐decimal places the answer is 17.2060179580.
