We start with the definite integral

  I = ∫ from x = –3/2 to –1/2 (x⁵ + 5x⁴ + 10x³ + 8x² + x) dx.

Step 1. Find an antiderivative F(x):

  ∫x⁵ dx = x⁶/6,
  ∫5x⁴ dx = 5x⁵/5 = x⁵,
  ∫10x³ dx = 10x⁴/4 = (5/2)x⁴,
  ∫8x² dx = 8x³/3,
  ∫x dx = x²/2.

Thus, an antiderivative is

  F(x) = x⁶/6 + x⁵ + (5/2)x⁴ + (8/3)x³ + x²/2.

Step 2. Evaluate F(x) at the endpoints.

For x = –1/2, first compute the powers:
  x = –1/2,
  x² = 1/4,
  x³ = –1/8,
  x⁴ = 1/16,
  x⁵ = –1/32,
  x⁶ = 1/64.

Now, substitute in F(x):

  F(–1/2) = (1/64)/6 + (–1/32) + (5/2)(1/16) + (8/3)(–1/8) + (1/2)(1/4)
        = 1/384 – 1/32 + 5/32 – 1/3 + 1/8.

Combine like terms:
  –1/32 + 5/32 = 4/32 = 1/8.

Thus,
  F(–1/2) = 1/384 + 1/8 + 1/8 – 1/3
        = 1/384 + 2/8 – 1/3
        = 1/384 + 1/4 – 1/3.

Express with common denominator 384:
  1/4 = 96/384, 1/3 = 128/384.
So,
  F(–1/2) = (1 + 96 – 128)/384 = –31/384.

For x = –3/2, compute the powers:
  x = –3/2,
  x² = 9/4,
  x³ = –27/8,
  x⁴ = 81/16,
  x⁵ = –243/32,
  x⁶ = 729/64.

Substitute in F(x):

  F(–3/2) = (729/64)/6 + (–243/32) + (5/2)(81/16) + (8/3)(–27/8) + (1/2)(9/4)
        = 729/384 – 243/32 + 405/32 – 9 + 9/8.

Combine the terms –243/32 and 405/32 first:
  –243/32 + 405/32 = 162/32 = 81/16.

Now express all terms with denominator 384:
  729/384 remains,
  81/16 = 81×24/384 = 1944/384,
  9 = 9×384/384 = 3456/384,
  9/8 = 9×48/384 = 432/384.

Thus,
  F(–3/2) = (729 + 1944 – 3456 + 432)/384 = (3105 – 3456)/384 = –351/384.
This simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
  F(–3/2) = –117/128.

Step 3. Now compute the definite integral:

  I = F(–1/2) – F(–3/2) = (–31/384) – (–117/128) = –31/384 + 117/128.

Convert 117/128 to denominator 384 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 3:
  117/128 = 351/384.

Thus,
  I = (–31 + 351)/384 = 320/384 = 20/24 = 5/6.

Step 4. The numerical approximation of 5/6 is approximately 0.8333333333 (to 10 decimal places).
