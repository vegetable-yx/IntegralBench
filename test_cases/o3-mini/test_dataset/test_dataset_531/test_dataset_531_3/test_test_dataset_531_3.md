We need to evaluate
  I = ∫₋₃/₂⁻₁/₂ (x⁵ + 5x⁴ + 10x³ + 8x² + x) dx.
Step 1. Find the antiderivative F(x):
  ∫ x⁵ dx = x⁶/6,
  ∫ 5x⁴ dx = 5·(x⁵/5) = x⁵,
  ∫ 10x³ dx = 10·(x⁴/4) = (5/2)x⁴,
  ∫ 8x² dx = 8·(x³/3) = (8/3)x³,
  ∫ x dx = x²/2.
So,
  F(x) = x⁶/6 + x⁵ + (5/2)x⁴ + (8/3)x³ + x²/2.

Step 2. Evaluate F(x) at the bounds.

For x = –1/2:
 • (–1/2)⁶ = 1/64  ⇒ x⁶/6 = 1/(64·6) = 1/384.
 • (–1/2)⁵ = –1/32  ⇒ x⁵ = –1/32.
 • (–1/2)⁴ = 1/16  ⇒ (5/2)x⁴ = (5/2)·(1/16) = 5/32.
 • (–1/2)³ = –1/8  ⇒ (8/3)x³ = (8/3)·(–1/8) = –1/3.
 • (–1/2)² = 1/4  ⇒ x²/2 = 1/8.
Now sum:
 F(–1/2) = 1/384 + (–1/32 + 5/32) + (–1/3) + 1/8
       = 1/384 + 4/32 – 1/3 + 1/8
       = 1/384 + 1/8 – 1/3 + 1/8
       = 1/384 + 2/8 – 1/3
       = 1/384 + 1/4 – 1/3.
Find a common denominator for 1/4 and 1/3:
  1/4 = 3/12, 1/3 = 4/12 ⇒ 1/4 – 1/3 = –1/12.
So,
 F(–1/2) = 1/384 – 1/12.
Expressing 1/12 as 32/384 gives:
 F(–1/2) = (1 – 32)/384 = –31/384.

For x = –3/2:
 • (–3/2)⁶ = (3⁶)/(2⁶) = 729/64  ⇒ x⁶/6 = 729/(64·6) = 729/384.
 • (–3/2)⁵ = –(3⁵)/(2⁵) = –243/32  ⇒ x⁵ = –243/32.
 • (–3/2)⁴ = (3⁴)/(2⁴) = 81/16  ⇒ (5/2)x⁴ = (5/2)·(81/16) = 405/32.
 • (–3/2)³ = –27/8  ⇒ (8/3)x³ = (8/3)·(–27/8) = –9.
 • (–3/2)² = 9/4  ⇒ x²/2 = 9/8.
Now sum:
 F(–3/2) = 729/384 + (–243/32 + 405/32) – 9 + 9/8.
Combine the middle terms:
 –243/32 + 405/32 = 162/32 = 81/16.
Thus,
 F(–3/2) = 729/384 + 81/16 – 9 + 9/8.
Convert to denominator 384:
 81/16 = (81×24)/384 = 1944/384,
 9 = (9×384)/384 = 3456/384,
 9/8 = (9×48)/384 = 432/384.
So,
 F(–3/2) = (729 + 1944 + 432 – 3456)/384 = (3105 – 3456)/384 = –351/384.
This simplifies (dividing numerator and denominator by 3) to –117/128 if desired.

Step 3. Compute the definite integral:
 I = F(–1/2) – F(–3/2) = (–31/384) – (–351/384) = (320/384).
Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 16:
 320/384 = 20/24 = 5/6.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
 5/6 ≈ 0.8333333333 (rounded to 10 decimal places).

The final answer is:

{"answer": "\\frac{5}{6}", "numerical_answer": "0.8333333333"}
