We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫ from x = –3/2 to x = –1/2 (x⁵ + 5x⁴ + 10x³ + 8x² + x) dx.

Step 1. Find an antiderivative by integrating term‐by-term.

  ∫ x⁵ dx = x⁶/6,
  ∫ 5x⁴ dx = 5x⁵/5 = x⁵,
  ∫ 10x³ dx = 10x⁴/4 = (5/2)x⁴,
  ∫ 8x² dx = 8x³/3,
  ∫ x dx = x²/2.

Thus, an antiderivative F(x) is

  F(x) = (1/6)x⁶ + x⁵ + (5/2)x⁴ + (8/3)x³ + (1/2)x².

Step 2. Evaluate F(x) at the two endpoints.

First, compute F(–1/2):

(a) (1/6)(–1/2)⁶ = (1/6)(1/64) = 1/384.
(b) (–1/2)⁵ = –1/32.
(c) (5/2)(–1/2)⁴ = (5/2)(1/16) = 5/32.
(d) (8/3)(–1/2)³ = (8/3)(–1/8) = –1/3.
(e) (1/2)(–1/2)² = (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8.

Combine these:
  F(–1/2) = 1/384 – 1/32 + 5/32 – 1/3 + 1/8.

Expressing all terms with common denominator 384:
  1/384 = 1/384,
  –1/32 = –12/384,
  5/32 = 60/384,
  –1/3 = –128/384,
  1/8 = 48/384.

So,
  F(–1/2) = (1 – 12 + 60 – 128 + 48) / 384 = (–31)/384.

Next, compute F(–3/2):

(a) (1/6)(–3/2)⁶ = (1/6)[(3/2)⁶] = (1/6)(729/64) = 729/384.
(b) (–3/2)⁵ = –(3/2)⁵ = –243/32.
(c) (5/2)(–3/2)⁴ = (5/2)[(3/2)⁴] = (5/2)(81/16) = 405/32.
(d) (8/3)(–3/2)³ = (8/3)[–(27/8)] = –27/3 = –9.
(e) (1/2)(–3/2)² = (1/2)(9/4) = 9/8.

Express every term with denominator 384:
  729/384 is already over 384,
  –243/32 = –(243×12)/384 = –2916/384,
  405/32 = (405×12)/384 = 4860/384,
  –9 = –9×384/384 = –3456/384,
  9/8 = (9×48)/384 = 432/384.

Thus,
  F(–3/2) = (729 – 2916 + 4860 – 3456 + 432) / 384.
Combine the numerators:
  729 – 2916 = –2187,
  –2187 + 4860 = 2673,
  2673 – 3456 = –783,
  –783 + 432 = –351.
So, F(–3/2) = –351/384.

Step 3. Compute the definite integral I = F(–1/2) – F(–3/2):

  I = (–31/384) – (–351/384) = (–31 + 351)/384 = 320/384.
Simplify 320/384 by dividing numerator and denominator by 32:
  320 ÷ 32 = 10, 384 ÷ 32 = 12,
and then divide by 2:
  10/12 = 5/6.

Thus, the exact answer is 5/6.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:

  5/6 ≈ 0.8333333333 (to 10 decimal places).
