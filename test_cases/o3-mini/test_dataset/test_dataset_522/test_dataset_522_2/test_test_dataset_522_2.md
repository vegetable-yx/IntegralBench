We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ (e^(–(2019/(4t²))) / t²) dt.

Step 1. Make the substitution:
  u = (2019/(4)) / t²  ⟹  t² = (2019/(4)) / u  and  t = √(2019/(4u)).
Differentiate t with respect to u:
  dt/du = d(√(2019/(4u)))/du = –½ √(2019/4) u^(–3/2),
so
  dt = –(√(2019/4))/(2) u^(–3/2) du.

Notice also that
  1/t² = u/(2019/4) = (4u)/2019.

Step 2. Change the limits of integration:
  When t → 0⁺, u = (2019/4)/t² → ∞.
  When t → ∞, u → 0.
Thus, the integration in u will run from u = ∞ to u = 0.

Step 3. Substitute everything into the integral:
  I = ∫₀∞ (e^(–(2019/(4t²)))/t²) dt = ∫[u=∞]^[0] e^(–u) × (4u/2019) × (–√(2019/4)/(2)) u^(–3/2) du.

Combine the factors:
  The u-factors: u × u^(–3/2) = u^(–1/2).

  The constant factors:
   (4/2019) × (√(2019/4)) = (4 × √(2019/4))/2019 = (4√2019/2)/2019 = (2√2019)/2019.
Including the factor of –½ gives: –(2√2019)/(2019) × (1/2) = –(√2019)/(2019).

Then,
  I = –(√2019)/(2019) ∫[u=∞]^[0] e^(–u) u^(–1/2) du.
Reversing the limits (which changes the sign) we have:
  I = (√2019)/(2019) ∫₀∞ e^(–u) u^(–1/2) du.

Step 4. Recognize the Gamma function:
Recall that
  Γ(α) = ∫₀∞ e^(–u) u^(α–1) du.
Here, with α – 1 = –1/2 we have α = ½, and thus
  ∫₀∞ e^(–u) u^(–1/2) du = Γ(½) = √π.

So,
  I = (√2019)/(2019) × √π = √π/√2019
  (since (√2019)/(2019) = 1/√2019).

Step 5. Final Answer
The exact answer is:
  I = √π/√2019.

Step 6. Numerical Approximation
To compute the numerical value:
  √π ≈ 1.7724538509,
  √2019: Note that 45² = 2025 so √2019 is slightly less than 45. A numerical evaluation gives
   √2019 ≈ 44.9444101085.
Thus,
  I ≈ 1.7724538509 / 44.9444101085 ≈ 0.0394470000.
