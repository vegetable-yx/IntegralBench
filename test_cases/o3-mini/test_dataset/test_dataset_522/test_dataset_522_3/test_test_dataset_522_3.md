We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^∞ e^(–(2019/(4t²))) / t² dt.

Step 1. Substitute u = 1/t. Then
  t = 1/u  and  dt = –du/u².
The limits change as:
  when t → 0⁺, u → ∞,
  when t → ∞, u → 0⁺.

The integrand transforms as follows:
  1/t² = u²,
  e^(–(2019/(4t²))) = e^(–(2019u²/4)),
so that
  e^(–(2019/(4t²))) / t² dt = u² e^(–(2019u²/4)) * (–du/u²) = –e^(–(2019u²/4)) du.

Thus, the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^∞ e^(–(2019/(4t²)))/t² dt = ∫_(u=∞)^(0) [–e^(–(2019u²/4))] du.
Reversing the limits gives
  I = ∫₀^∞ e^(–(2019u²/4)) du.

Step 2. Recognize the standard integral
  ∫₀^∞ e^(–αu²) du = ½√(π/α)
with α = 2019/4. Hence,
  I = ½√(π/(2019/4)) = ½√(4π/2019) = √(π/2019).

Step 3. Numerical approximation. We have
  I = √(π/2019) ≈ √(3.141592653589793/2019).
Calculating the ratio gives approximately 0.001556, and the square root is approximately 0.0394535810 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
