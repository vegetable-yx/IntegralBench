We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions Iₙ(⋅), the second–kind functions Kₙ(⋅) and the Struve functions Hₙ(⋅). (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  (1)  I = ¼ [ π ( I₀(2) H₁(2) – I₁(2) H₀(2) ) + 2 ( I₀(2) K₁(2) + I₁(2) K₀(2) ) ] .

In what follows a “derivation‐outline” is given and then a numerical value is computed.

A useful method is to “introduce a parameter” and then to “differentiate under the integral sign.” For example one may show that for 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 one has
  
  F(z) = ∫₀ᶻ [I₁(x)/x] K₀(z–x) dx 
    = ¼ [ π ( I₀(z) H₁(z) – I₁(z) H₀(z) ) + 2 ( I₀(z) K₁(z) + I₁(z) K₀(z) ) ] .
Then setting z = 2 gives (1). (There are several ways to show this; for example one may expand I₁ in its series definition, exchange summation and integration and then use known integrals – or use Laplace transforms.)

Numerical evaluation (using standard software or tables) gives

  I ≈ 0.41165   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = ¼ [ π ( I₀(2) H₁(2) – I₁(2) H₀(2) ) + 2 ( I₀(2) K₁(2) + I₁(2) K₀(2) ) ],
  with numerical value 0.4116500000.
