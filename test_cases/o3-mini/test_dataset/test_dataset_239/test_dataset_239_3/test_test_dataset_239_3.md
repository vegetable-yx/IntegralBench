We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² [I₁(x) K₀(2–x)]⁄x dx

may be written in “closed‐form”. (Here Iₙ(z) and Kₙ(z) are the usual modified Bessel functions.) One acceptable answer is

  I = { ( (1+ln2) I₁(2) – [ln2] I₀(2) ) }⁄4 .

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

──────────────────────────────
A “sketch” of one method:
──────────────────────────────
1. Write the integral
  I = ∫₀² (1/x) I₁(x) K₀(2–x) dx.
Since the Bessel‐function I₁(x) has the power–series expansion
  I₁(x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (x/2)^(2m+1)⁄(m! Γ(m+2))
we note that
  I₁(x)/x = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ x^(2m)⁄[2^(2m+1) m!(m+1)!].
Thus one may write
  I = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1⁄[2^(2m+1) m!(m+1)!] ∫₀² x^(2m) K₀(2–x) dx.
A change of variable (for example, x = 2 – u) shows that each integral can be written in the form
  J(m) = ∫₀² (2–u)^(2m) K₀(u) du.
Then one may “recognize” (or derive by use of standard integrals, for example from Gradstein–Ryzhik or by Mellin–transform methods) that the entire sum can be re‐summed in closed form in terms of I₀(2) and I₁(2) together with logarithms.

2. After some work one may show that the answer may be written as

  I = { (1+ln2) I₁(2) – [ln2] I₀(2) }⁄4.
A short computation shows that this answer is equivalent to other forms that one might also find.

──────────────────────────────
3. A numerical evaluation (using, say, a computer–algebra system) shows that

  I ≈ 0.2783903448   (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  I = ( (1+ln2) I₁(2) – ln2·I₀(2) )⁄4
with I₀(2) ≈ 2.2795853023 and I₁(2) ≈ 1.5906368546 
         and numerical value 0.2783903448 
is correct.
