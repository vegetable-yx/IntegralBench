We want to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ log⁷(1/x) dx.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand.

Since log(1/x) = −log x, we have
  I = ∫₀¹ (−log x)⁷ dx.

Step 2. Use the substitution u = −log x.
  Then x = e^(−u) and dx = −e^(−u) du.
When x = 1, u = −log 1 = 0, and as x → 0, u → ∞.
Thus, the limits change from x ∈ [0, 1] to u ∈ [∞, 0]. Reversing the limits we get:
  I = ∫₍∞₎⁰ u⁷ (−e^(−u)) du = ∫₀^∞ u⁷ e^(−u) du.

Step 3. Recognize the gamma function.

Recall that for any nonnegative integer n,
  ∫₀^∞ uⁿ e^(−u) du = n!.
Here n = 7, so the integral becomes
  I = 7! = 5040.

Step 4. Provide the numerical approximation.

Since 5040 is an integer,
  numerical approximation = 5040.0000000000 (with 10 decimal places).

Thus, the final result is:

{"answer": "$5040$", "numerical_answer": "5040.0000000000"}
