We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ log⁷(1/x) dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution
  u = log(1/x) ⇒ x = e^(–u).
Then, differentiate to get
  dx = –e^(–u) du.
When x goes from 0 to 1, u changes as follows:
  x = 1 ⇒ u = log(1) = 0,
  x → 0⁺ ⇒ u → +∞.
Thus, the limits of integration become u = ∞ to u = 0, and the integral becomes
  I = ∫₍∞₎⁰ u⁷ (–e^(–u)) du = ∫₀^(∞) u⁷ e^(–u) du.

Step 2. Recognize the Gamma function. Recall that the Gamma function is defined by
  Γ(α) = ∫₀^(∞) u^(α–1) e^(–u) du.
Here, comparing with u⁷ = u^(8–1), we see that α = 8. Thus,
  I = Γ(8).

Step 3. Use the property of the Gamma function for natural numbers:
  Γ(n + 1) = n!.
So,
  Γ(8) = 7! = 5040.

Step 4. Compute the numerical approximation (to 10 decimal places):
  5040.0000000000 (which rounds exactly to 5040.0000000000).

Thus, the final exact answer is 7! (or equivalently Γ(8)) and the numerical value is 5040.0000000000.
