We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ log⁷(1/x) dx.

Notice that log(1/x) = –log(x). We make the substitution

  u = log(1/x) ⟹ x = e^(–u),
  dx = –e^(–u) du.

The limits transform as follows:
  when x = 1, u = log(1) = 0,
  when x = 0, u → ∞.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^∞ u⁷ e^(–u) du.

This is exactly the Gamma function evaluated at 8:
  I = Γ(8) = 7! = 5040.

Thus, the exact answer is 5040 and its numerical approximation (to 10 decimal places) is 5040.0000000000.
