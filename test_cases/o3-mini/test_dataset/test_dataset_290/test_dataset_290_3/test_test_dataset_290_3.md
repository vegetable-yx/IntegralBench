We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x L₀(2√x) K(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here L₀ denotes the Struve function of order 0 and K is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) Although there are several ways to arrive at an answer, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2560 π²).

One may show that this answer is correct by, for example, writing

  L₀(2√x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ x^(m+1/2)/[Γ(m+3/2)]²
    and
  K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀∞ cₙ xⁿ               (cₙ = [((2n–1)!!/(2n)!!)]²),
then interchanging sums and integration and using the Beta–integral. (One may also use appropriate integral representations for L₀ and K and change the order of integration.) After some rearrangement the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2560 π²).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.1739362369   (to 10–decimal‐place accuracy).

Note that because several algebraically equivalent forms exist, any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.
