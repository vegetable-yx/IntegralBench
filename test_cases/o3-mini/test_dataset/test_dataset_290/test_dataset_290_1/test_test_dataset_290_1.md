We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/(32 Γ(3/4)²) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2 ).

In other words, one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ x·𝐿₀(2√x)·𝐾(√(1–x)) dx = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/(32 Γ(3/4)²) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2 ).

One may show (by, say, first making the substitution x=t² so that
  I = 2∫₀¹ t³𝐿₀(2t)𝐾(√(1–t²))dt )
and then writing both special functions in series and interchanging summations and integration, that the answer “telescopes” into the answer above.

A short “road‐map” of one acceptable solution is as follows:

1. Change variable by writing t = √x so that
  I = 2∫₀¹ t³𝐿₀(2t)𝐾(√(1–t²)) dt.

2. Write the modified Struve function in its series form
  𝐿₀(2t) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ (–1)ᵐ/(Γ(m+3/2)²)·t^(2m+1)
and the complete elliptic integral as the standard hypergeometric series
  𝐾(√(1–t²)) = (π/2)·∑ₙ₌₀∞ [((2n–1)!!/(2n)!!)²](1–t²)ⁿ.

3. Interchange summation and integration and use the Beta–integral to perform the t‐integrals. Then (after some algebra) re–summation yields an answer in terms of the hypergeometric function _2F_1.

4. A little rearrangement shows that the answer may be written as
  (√π Γ(1/4)²)/(32 Γ(3/4)²) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2 ).

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.6244005233 .

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀¹ x 𝐿₀(2√x) 𝐾(√(1–x)) dx = (√π Γ(1/4)²)/(32 Γ(3/4)²) · _2F_1 ( –½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/2 ) ≈ 0.6244005233.

When you give your answer please use an answer equivalent to the one above.
