We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2018π) |sin(2018x)| dx.

Step 1. Notice that |sin(2018x)| is periodic. In fact, while sin(2018x) has period T₁ = 2π/2018, its absolute value has period

  T = π/2018  
(since |sin(2018(x + π/2018))| = |sin(2018x + π)| = |– sin(2018x)| = |sin(2018x)|).

Step 2. Determine the number of periods within the interval [0, 2018π]. The length of each period is T = π/2018. The number N of periods is

  N = (2018π) / (π/2018) = 2018².

Step 3. Compute the integral over one period. Over an interval of one period, say from 0 to π/2018, make the substitution
  u = 2018x  ⟹  du = 2018 dx,  dx = du/2018.
Then
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2018) |sin(2018x)| dx = ∫₀^(π) |sin(u)| (du/2018)
    = (1/2018) ∫₀^(π) |sin(u)| du.
Since ∫₀^(π) |sin(u)| du = 2, we obtain
  I₁ = 2/2018.

Step 4. Multiply I₁ by the number of periods:
  I = N × I₁ = (2018²) × (2/2018) = 2 × 2018 = 4036.

Step 5. The exact answer is 4036, and its numerical approximation is 4036.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).
