We want to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2018π) |sin(2018x)| dx.

Step 1. Change of variable.
Let u = 2018x so that du = 2018 dx, which gives dx = du/2018. The integration limits become:
  x = 0 ⟹ u = 0,
  x = 2018π ⟹ u = 2018 × 2018π = 2018²π.
Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(2018²π) |sin u| (du/2018) = (1/2018) ∫₀^(2018²π) |sin u| du.

Step 2. Use periodicity.
The function |sin u| has period π. Thus, the interval [0, 2018²π] contains exactly 2018² periods. Also, the integral over one period [0, π] is

  ∫₀^(π) |sin u| du = 2.

So, we have

  ∫₀^(2018²π) |sin u| du = 2018² × 2.

Thus, the integral I becomes

  I = (1/2018) × (2018² × 2) = 2018 × 2 = 4036.

Step 3. Numerical approximation.
Since the exact result is 4036, the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is

  4036.0000000000
