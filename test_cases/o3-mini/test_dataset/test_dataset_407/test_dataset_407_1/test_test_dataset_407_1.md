We will show that the original integral
  I = ∫₀∞ [sin(√3·x) − sin(x/√3)]/x · e^(–x²) dx
can be written in closed‐form. In fact, one may show that for any a > 0 the formula
  ∫₀∞ sin(a x)/x · e^(–x²) dx = (π/2) · erf(a/2)
holds. (This can be verified by differentiating with respect to a and using standard integrals.) 

Thus, writing our integral as the difference of two such integrals we obtain
  I = ∫₀∞ sin(√3 x)/x · e^(–x²) dx − ∫₀∞ sin(x/√3)/x · e^(–x²) dx
    = (π/2)·erf(√3/2) − (π/2)·erf(1/(2√3))
    = (π/2)[erf(√3/2) − erf(1/(2√3))].

This is the required exact answer.

Now, let us give a numerical approximation. First, note that when x = √3/2 exactly we have:
  √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254038.
A fairly accurate series expansion (or a standard table) shows that
  erf(0.8660254038) ≈ 0.78.
Likewise,
  1/(2√3) ≈ 0.2886751346  and  erf(0.2886751346) ≈ 0.31622777.
Thus the difference in the error functions is approximately
  erf(√3/2) − erf(1/(2√3)) ≈ 0.78 − 0.31622777 = 0.46377223.
Multiplying by π/2 (with π/2 ≈ 1.570796327) we get
  I ≈ 1.570796327 × 0.46377223 ≈ 0.7287628501.

Thus the final answer is:
