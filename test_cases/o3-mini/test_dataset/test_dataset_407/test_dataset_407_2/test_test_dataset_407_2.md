We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀∞ [sin(√3 · x) – sin(x/√3)]/x · e^(–x²) dx.

Step 1. Express the integrals in a form we can work with.

A useful fact is that for any constant a ≥ 0 one may show by differentiating with respect to a that

  J(a) = ∫₀∞ [sin(ax)/x] e^(–x²) dx = (π/2) erf(a/2).

To check this, differentiate with respect to a under the integral sign:
  d/da J(a) = ∫₀∞ cos(ax) e^(–x²) dx
and one may verify that
  d/da [(π/2) erf(a/2)] = (π/2)·(2/√π) e^(–a²/4)·(1/2) = (√π/2) e^(–a²/4),
which is indeed equal to the value of the cosine–Gaussian integral.

Step 2. Write the given integral as a difference.

With a = √3 and b = 1/√3, we have

  I = ∫₀∞ {sin(√3 x) – sin((1/√3)x)}/x · e^(–x²) dx
    = J(√3) – J(1/√3)
    = (π/2)[erf(√3/2) – erf(1/(2√3))].

Thus, the exact answer is

  (π/2)[erf(√3/2) – erf(1/(2√3))].

Step 3. A Numerical Approximation

We now approximate the error functions:
 • √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254. Using a series (or a table/calculator) one finds
  erf(0.8660254) ≈ 0.77864.
 • 1/(2√3) ≈ 0.2886751 and
  erf(0.2886751) ≈ 0.31617.

The difference is approximately
  0.77864 – 0.31617 = 0.46247.

Multiplying by π/2 (with π/2 ≈ 1.5708) gives

  I ≈ 1.5708 × 0.46247 ≈ 0.72600.
