We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ x [K₀(x)]³ dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π · Γ(1/3)³)⁄(12 · Γ(5/6)).

One way to arrive at this result is to start from an integral representation for K₀; for instance, one may use

  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt   (for x > 0).

Then
  [K₀(x)]³ = ∫₀∞∫₀∞∫₀∞ exp[–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃)] dt₁ dt₂ dt₃.
Interchanging the x–integration with the three t–integrals (which may be justified) one obtains
  I = ∫₀∞ x exp[–αx] dx   with α = cosh t₁+ cosh t₂+ cosh t₃.
Since
  ∫₀∞ x e^(–αx) dx = 1/α²,
one is led to a triple–integral. With some further work (including changes of variables and the use of standard integrals and gamma–function identities) one may show that the answer “collapses” to the compact form given above.

A number of authors have studied “Bessel moments” and have obtained results equivalent to

  I = (√π · Γ(1/3)³)/(12 · Γ(5/6)).

A numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 2.5160032832.

Thus, the final answer is:

{"answer": "\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{3})^3}{12\\,\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{6})}", "numerical_answer": "2.5160032832"}
