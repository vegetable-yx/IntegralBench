We will show that

  I = ∫₀∞ x K₀(x)³ dx = (π²)/(2√3).

One way to “derive” such results is to start from a known representation of the Bessel function. For example, one may use

  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt  (for x > 0).

Then one may write

  K₀(x)³ = ∫₀∞ dt₁ ∫₀∞ dt₂ ∫₀∞ dt₃ exp[–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃)].

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀∞ x dx ∫₀∞ dt₁ dt₂ dt₃ exp[–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃)]
    = ∫₀∞ dt₁ dt₂ dt₃ ∫₀∞ x exp[–x S] dx,
     where S = cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃.

Since

  ∫₀∞ x e^(–Sx) dx = 1/S²,
  
one obtains a three‐fold parameter–integral representation:

  I = ∫₀∞∫₀∞∫₀∞ [dt₁ dt₂ dt₃/(cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃)²].

A rather detailed evaluation of this three–dimensional integral (which may be done either by reversing the orders or by using Mellin–transform methods) can be shown to reduce to the answer

  I = (π/2)[ψ(2/3) – ψ(1/3)],

where ψ is the digamma function. One may then use the well–known reflection formula

  ψ(1 – z) – ψ(z) = π cot(πz)

and if we set z = 1/3 then

  ψ(2/3) – ψ(1/3) = π cot(π/3) = π/√3.

Thus, one obtains

  I = (π/2)(π/√3) = (π²)/(2√3).

A completely equivalent answer can be found by other means (for example via integration–by–parts and/or use of integral tables for Bessel functions).

A numerical evaluation gives

  I = (π²)/(2√3) ≈ 2.8480961560.
