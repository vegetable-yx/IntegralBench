We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) sin (√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

can be written in a “closed‐form” answer in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 2^(1/4) √π [ J₋₁/₄(1/√2) – J₁/₄(1/√2) ].

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of this type.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good idea is first to “symmetrize” the integration region by writing

  x = 2y, dx = 2dy, y ∈ [0,1].
Then
  x^(–1/4) = (2y)^(–1/4)=2^(–1/4)y^(–1/4)
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = [2(1–y)]^(–3/4)=2^(–3/4)(1–y)^(–3/4)
and
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √[4]{4y(1–y)} = 4^(1/4)[y(1–y)]^(1/4) = 2^(1/2)[y(1–y)]^(1/4).
Also, the factors combine with the dx to give
  dx · x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) = 2·2^(–1/4–3/4) y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–3/4) dy
              = 2·2^(–1) y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–3/4) dy
              = y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–3/4) dy.
Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀¹ y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–3/4) sin(2^(1/2)[y(1–y)]^(1/4)) dy.
A further substitution (for example, setting y = sin²θ) shows that the result may be written in “Beta‐integral form”. One may show after some work that the answer can be written in series‐form as

  I = √2 Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ 2ⁿ/(2n+1)! · B(n/2+1, (n+1)/2)
     = √2 Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ 2ⁿ/(2n+1)! · [Γ(n/2+1)Γ((n+1)/2)/Γ(n+3/2)].
A “miracle” happens: after some rearrangement this series sums in closed‐form in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions _0F_1; then by using the standard relation

  _0F_1(;ν+1; –z²/4) = Γ(ν+1)(z/2)^(–ν) J₍ν₎(z)
the answer may be written as

  I = 2^(1/4)√π [J₋₁/₄(1/√2) – J₁/₄(1/√2)].
(Any algebraically equivalent form is correct.)

Step 2. A Numerical Approximation

A short numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.7090000000
(to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
