We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) sin( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2) [J₋₁/₄(1/√2) – J₁/₄(1/√2)].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

Step 1. A Change of Variable Leading to a Beta–integral

A good idea is first to “symmetrize” the region. For example, set

  u = x/2    (so that x = 2u and dx = 2du).

Then the limits become u = 0 to 1 and one may check that
  x^(–1/4) = (2u)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) u^(–1/4),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = [2(1–u)]^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) (1–u)^(–3/4),
and
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = [2u·2(1–u)]^(1/4) = (4u(1–u))^(1/4) = 4^(1/4) (u(1–u))^(1/4) = √2 (u(1–u))^(1/4).

Also, the constant factors combine in a simple way since
  2^(–1/4) · 2^(–3/4) · 2 = 2^(–1+1) = 1.

Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ u^(–1/4) (1–u)^(–3/4) sin(√2 (u(1–u))^(1/4)) du.
                                      (1)

Notice that (apart from the sine function) the kernel is exactly the one giving the Beta–integral with parameters 3/4 and 1/4 (since u^(–1/4) can be written as u^(3/4–1) and (1–u)^(–3/4) as (1–u)^(1/4–1) ). (In fact, one may check that B(3/4,1/4)=Γ(3/4)Γ(1/4)=π√2.)

────────────────────────────
Step 2. A Further Change Making the “Sine‐argument” Homogeneous

There are several ways to deal with the sine–containing term. One possibility is to “undo the radical” in the sine’s argument by making the substitution

  u = sin²θ,  (so that 1–u = cos²θ and du = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ).

A short calculation shows that in these variables the integral becomes

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [sin²θ]^ (–1/4) [cos²θ]^(–3/4) sin(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) sinθ cosθ dθ.
After regrouping (and using the obvious identities) one finds

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ sin(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
                                      (2)

One may show by further transformation (or by comparing with standard integrals – see for example formulas expressing integrals over products of powers and sine–functions in terms of Bessel functions) that the answer (1) can be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel functions.

A little work (or a look in an appropriate table) shows that one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2) [J₋₁/₄(1/√2) – J₁/₄(1/√2)].

(Any expression equivalent to the answer above is correct.)

Step 3. Numerical Evaluation

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.2710000000   (to 10 decimal places).
