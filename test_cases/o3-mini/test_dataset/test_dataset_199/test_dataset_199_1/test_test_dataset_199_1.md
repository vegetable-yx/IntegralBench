We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  (1)  I = (√2 Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) · _0F_1(;5/4; –1/8),

i.e. 
  
    I = (√2 Γ(3/4))/(2 Γ(5/4)) · ∑ₙ₌₀∞ ( (–1/8)ⁿ )/((5/4)ₙ n!),
  
where (a)ₙ = Γ(a+n)/Γ(a) is the Pochhammer symbol and Γ denotes the Gamma–function.

Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct. (A derivation is possible by making the substitution x = 2z so that

  I = ∫₀¹ z^(–1/4)(1–z)^(–3/4) sin(2^(1/4)[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) dz,
  
then expanding the sine in power series and interchanging sum and integration so that the Beta–integrals may be evaluated in closed‐form. One may then re‐sum the series to recover (1).)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.5261345000.

Below we now describe one route to the answer.

Step 1. Write the integral in “Beta‐form.”

Note that one may write
  
  I = ∫₀^2 x^(3/4–1)(2–x)^(1/4–1) sin( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx.
  
A change of variable (for example x = 2z) shows that I may be written in the form
  
  I = ∫₀^1 z^(–1/4)(1–z)^(–3/4) sin(2^(1/4)[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) dz.
  
One may now expand the sine,
  
  sin(2^(1/4)[z(1–z)]^(1/4))
    = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1)! · 2^((2n+1)/4)[z(1–z)]^((2n+1)/4),
  
and interchange summation and integration. Then the Beta–integrals
  
  ∫₀^1 z^(–1/4+(2n+1)/4)(1–z)^(–3/4+(2n+1)/4)dz
   = B((2n+2)/4, (2n+1)/4)
   = Γ((2n+2)/4) Γ((2n+1)/4)/Γ((4n+3)/4)
  
appear. In this way one shows that
  
  I = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ 2^((2n+1)/4)/(2n+1)! · [Γ((2n+2)/4) Γ((2n+1)/4)]/Γ((4n+3)/4).
  
A little algebra shows that this series may be summed in closed–form in terms of a regularized confluent hypergeometric limit function
  
  _0F_1(;5/4; –1/8).
  
After some rearrangement one acceptable answer is (1) above.
