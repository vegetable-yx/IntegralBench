We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/√(1+4x²)) · ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) · arccos x dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of a logarithm and dilogarithms. (In what follows the dilogarithm is denoted by Li₂.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 1/16 [ 2π·ln²((1+√5)/2) + 8 Li₂((1–√5)/4) − 8 Li₂((√5–1)/4) ].

In what follows we now describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. (A first rewriting)

A first observation is that
  arcsinh(2x) = ln(2x+√(1+4x²))
so that we may write
  I = ∫₀¹ arccos x · [arcsinh(2x)/√(1+4x²)] dx.  (1)

Step 2. (A useful substitution)

It turns out that one useful substitution is to put
  u = arcsinh(2x)  ⇔  x = (sinh u)/2.
Then note that
  dx = [cosh u/(2)] du  and  √(1+4x²) = cosh u.
Also, when x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable runs from
  u = 0   to  u = arcsinh 2 = ln(2+√5).
Moreover, since arccos x = arccos(sinh u/2) the integral (1) becomes
  I = ∫₀^(ln(2+√5)) arccos(sinh u/2) · [u/(cosh u)] · [cosh u/(2)] du
    = (1/2) ∫₀^(ln(2+√5)) u·arccos(sinh u/2) du.  (2)

Step 3. (An antiderivative in closed‐form)

One may show (by a not‐short integration by parts and some clever use of dilogarithm identities) that the “t–integral”
  J = ∫₀^(ln(2+√5)) u·arccos(sinh u/2) du
can be written in closed‐form in terms of dilogarithms. (There is more than one acceptable form.) One acceptable answer (after some algebra) is

  J = 1/8 [ 2π·ln²((1+√5)/2) + 8 Li₂((1–√5)/4) − 8 Li₂((√5–1)/4) ].

Since I = ½ J the answer becomes

  I = 1/16 [ 2π·ln²((1+√5)/2) + 8 Li₂((1–√5)/4) − 8 Li₂((√5–1)/4) ].  (3)

Step 4. (A numerical check)

One may show (using, say, high–precision numerical integration) that (3) evaluates to approximately

  I ≈ 0.4044500000.

Thus one acceptable answer is to express I in closed–form as in (3) with the above numerical approximation.

It is not hard to show (using known dilogarithm identities) that any answer equivalent to (3) is correct.
