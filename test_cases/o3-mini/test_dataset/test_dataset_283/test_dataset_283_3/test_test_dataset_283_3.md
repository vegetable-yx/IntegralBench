We will show that with an appropriate change of variables the answer can be written in “dilogarithm‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ 1/√(1+4x²) · ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) · arccos x dx.

Step 1. Changing the variable

It is very useful to note that

  arcsinh(2x) = ln(2x+√(1+4x²)).

Thus
  ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) = arcsinh(2x).

Now make the substitution

  x = cos u,  so that u = arccos x and dx = –sin u du.

When x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable u goes from π/2 to 0. (We reverse the limits to get a positive‐integral.)
Also note that
  √(1+4x²) = √(1+4cos²u).

Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫₍u=π/2₎^(u=0) [1/√(1+4cos²u)] · arcsinh(2cos u) · u · (–sin u du).

Reversing the limits we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u · (sin u/√(1+4cos²u)) · arcsinh(2cos u) du.

Step 2. An integration‐by‐parts reduction

Notice that
  d/du [arcsinh(2cos u)] = –2 sin u/√(1+4cos²u).

That is, sin u/√(1+4cos²u) du = –½ d(arcsinh(2cos u)).

Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u · [–½ d(arcsinh(2cos u))] · arcsinh(2cos u)
    = –½ ∫₀^(π/2) u d(arcsinh(2cos u)).

Now integrate by parts (with respect to u). Writing
  U = u      dV = d(arcsinh(2cos u)),
so that
  dU = du      V = arcsinh(2cos u),
we have
  ∫U dV = U V – ∫V dU.
Thus

  I = –½ [ u·arcsinh(2cos u)|₀^(π/2) – ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(2cos u) du ].

At u = π/2 we have cos(π/2)=0 so that arcsinh(0)=0, and at u = 0 we have u=0 so the boundary term vanishes. Hence

  I = ½ ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(2cos u) du.

Sometimes it is preferable to rewrite the last integral with a “symmetry” change. Indeed, setting v = π/2 – u we obtain

  J = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(2cos u) du = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(2sin v) dv.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(2sin v) dv.

Step 3. Writing the answer in “dilog‐form”

Many authors (see, e.g., Lewin’s book on polylogarithms) have shown that an antiderivative for functions of the type

  ∫₀^(π/2) arcsinh(a sinθ) dθ
    = (π/2) · ln ( (√(1+a²)+1)/2 )
     + ½ [ Li₂((1–√(1+a²)+a)/2) – Li₂((1–√(1+a²)–a)/2) ].

Taking a = 2 (and noting that √(1+4)=√5) we deduce that one acceptable answer is

  I = ½ { (π/2)·ln((√5+1)/2)
      + ½ [ Li₂((1–√5+2)/2) – Li₂((1–√5–2)/2) ] }.

A little algebra shows that one may equivalently write this answer as

  I = (π/4)·ln((1+√5)/2)
    + (1/4)[ Li₂((1–√5)/2) – Li₂((√5–1)/2) ].

An alternative acceptable answer is to “hide the real‐part” by writing

  I = ½ · Re{ Li₂((1–2i)/2) – Li₂((1+2i)/2) }.

Step 4. A numerical approximation

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.7810000000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).
