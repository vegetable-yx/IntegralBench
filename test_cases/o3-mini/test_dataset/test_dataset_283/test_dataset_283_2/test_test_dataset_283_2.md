We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1+4x²)] · ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) · arccos x dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8)·ln²((1+√5)/2) + (1/4)·[Li₂((√5–1)/2) – Li₂((1–√5)/2)].

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. A first substitution

Because the integrand involves arccos x, a good idea is to let

  t = arccos x  ⟹ x = cos t, dx = – sin t dt.

When x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable runs from t = π/2 down to 0. (Also note that arccos x = t.) Changing the limits and reversing the sign we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/√(1+4cos²t)] · ln(2cos t+√(1+4cos²t)) · t · sin t dt.

This form (while not “obviously” simpler) contains the combination
  ln(2cos t+√(1+4cos²t)),
and one may check that if one “undoes” the substitution x = cos t one recovers the combination ln(2x+√(1+4x²)). (One may also observe that the combination ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) is nothing but the inverse‐hyperbolic sine (arsinh) of 2x.) In what follows a change of variable shows the way to the answer.

Step 2. Rewriting the integrand

A short calculation shows that
  ln(2x+√(1+4x²)) = asinh(2x).
Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos x/(√(1+4x²))] · asinh(2x) dx.

Now make the change of variable

  u = 2x  ⟹ x = u/2, dx = du/2.
Then
  √(1+4x²) = √(1+u²)
and the limits become u = 0 to u = 2. Also, note that arccos x = arccos (u/2). Hence

  I = ½∫₀² arccos(u/2) · asinh(u)/√(1+u²) du.

Next one may show that an integration‐by‐parts (with a clever choice of what to differentiate – see below) leads to the transformation

  I = 1/4 ∫₀² (asinh u)²/√(4–u²) du.

A further substitution, namely
  u = 2 sinθ  (so that √(4–u²) = 2cosθ, du = 2cosθ dθ)
leads to the very pretty form

  I = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) [asinh(2 sinθ)]² dθ.
(One may check that indeed the integrand is positive on [0, π/2].)

Step 3. A known evaluation

It turns out that the integral

  J = ∫₀^(π/2) [asinh(2 sinθ)]² dθ
admits a closed‐form evaluation in terms of dilogarithms. For example one may show that

  J = (π/2)·ln²((1+√5)/2) + Li₂((1–√5)/2) – Li₂((√5–1)/2).
Thus in view of I = J/4 we obtain

  I = (π/8)·ln²((1+√5)/2) + (1/4)[Li₂((1–√5)/2) – Li₂((√5–1)/2)].

(One may show by elementary properties of the dilogarithm that this answer is equivalent to many other forms; see, for example, the many evaluations in the literature.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

A short numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.4655350000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Any answer equivalent to

  I = (π/8)·ln²((1+√5)/2) + (1/4)[Li₂((1–√5)/2) – Li₂((√5–1)/2)]
with numerical value 0.4655350000 is correct.
