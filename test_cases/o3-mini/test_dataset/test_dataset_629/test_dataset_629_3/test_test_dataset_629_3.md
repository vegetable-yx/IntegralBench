We want to evaluate
  I = ∫₀¹ [x^(2023) − x^(23)] / ln x dx.

A key observation is that for any real number α, one may show that
  d/dα ∫₀¹ x^α dx = d/dα [1/(α + 1)] = −1/(α + 1)²,
but a more straightforward method is to use the formula:
  ∫₀¹ (x^a − x^b)/ln x dx = ln((a + 1)/(b + 1)),
which comes from differentiating with respect to the exponent under the integral sign.

Applying this with
  a = 2023  and  b = 23,
we get
  I = ln((2023 + 1)/(23 + 1)) = ln(2024/24).

Notice that 2024/24 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 8:
  2024/8 = 253  and  24/8 = 3,
so that
  2024/24 = 253/3.

Thus the exact answer is
  I = ln(253/3).

Now, for a numerical approximation:
  I ≈ ln(253/3) = ln(84.3333333333) ≈ 4.4348267113   (to 10 decimal places).
