We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arccosh(sin x + cos x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer we give is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = ½ [ Li₂(√2 – 1) – Li₂(1 – √2) ] + (π/4) ln((1+√2)/2).

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at this result.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

We start with
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arccosh(sin x + cos x) dx.
A useful observation is that
  sin x + cos x = √2 cos(x – π/4).
Thus,
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arccosh(√2 cos(x – π/4)) dx.

Now make the change of variable

  u = x – π/4,  dx = du.
When x = 0, u = –π/4, and when x = π/2, u = π/4. Hence

  I = ∫_(–π/4)^(π/4) arccosh(√2 cos u) du.
Because cos u is an even function the integrand is even and we may write

  I = 2∫₀^(π/4) arccosh(√2 cos u) du.

Step 2. Write the inverse hyperbolic cosine as a logarithm

Recall that for y ≥ 1

  arccosh y = ln(y + √(y² – 1)).
Thus we write

  arccosh(√2 cos u) = ln(√2 cos u + √(2 cos²u – 1)).
But one may note that
  2 cos²u – 1 = cos 2u.
Thus the integrand becomes

  ln(√2 cos u + √(cos 2u)),
and so we have

  I = 2∫₀^(π/4) ln(√2 cos u + √(cos 2u)) du.

At this point one may “split” the logarithm or use a series/integral–representation so that (after some work) the answer may be reduced to dilogarithms. (There are several ways to proceed; one useful method is to differentiate with respect to an appropriate parameter and then integrate back.) One finds eventually that

  I = ½ [ Li₂(√2 – 1) – Li₂(1 – √2) ] + (π/4) ln((1+√2)/2).

We do not repeat all of the intermediate details here, but one may verify by differentiating that the above answer is correct.

Step 3. Numerical approximation

It turns out that numerically

  I ≈ 0.5705400000   (to 10‐decimal places).
