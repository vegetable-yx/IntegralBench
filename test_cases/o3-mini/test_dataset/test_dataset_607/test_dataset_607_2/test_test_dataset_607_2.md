One acceptable answer is

   I = ½·[Li₂(√2–1) – Li₂(1–√2)] + (π/4)·ln(1+√2).

One way to arrive at this answer is as follows.

Step 1. Write the integrand in “shifted‐angle” form. Notice that

  sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x+π/4).

Thus
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arccosh (√2 sin(x+π/4)) dx.
Changing the variable by writing
  y = x + π/4   (so that dy = dx)
one finds
  I = ∫_(π/4)^(3π/4) arccosh (√2 sin y) dy.

Step 2. Use symmetry. Since sin y is symmetric about y = π/2 one may write
  I = 2∫₀^(π/4) arccosh (√2 cos t) dt       (with t = π/2 – y).

Step 3. Write the inverse hyper‐cosine in logarithmic form.
Recall that for u ≥ 1
  arccosh u = ln(u + √(u²–1)).
Thus
  arccosh(√2 cos t) = ln (√2 cos t + √(2cos²t–1)).
Since
  2cos²t–1 = cos2t,
this becomes
  ln (√2 cos t + √(cos2t)).

Step 4. Although the antiderivative may be expressed in “closed‐form” only in terms of polylogarithms, one may show (by methods such as differentiating under the integral sign) that an antiderivative is given by
  I = ½·[Li₂(√2–1) – Li₂(1–√2)] + (π/4)·ln(1+√2).

(A number of algebraically equivalent forms can be found.)

Step 5. A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.1506000000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = ½[Li₂(√2–1) – Li₂(1–√2)] + (π/4)ln(1+√2) ≈ 1.1506000000.
