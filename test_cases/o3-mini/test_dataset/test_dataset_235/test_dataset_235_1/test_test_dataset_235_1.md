We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–1/2) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of Gamma–functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)² + 4 Γ(3/4)²)⁄(2√π).

Below is one way of “arriving” at an answer.

Step 1. (A first substitution)
A good first change of variable is to let
  x = sin²θ   with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ\,dθ  and x^(–1/2) = 1/sinθ.
Also, note that
  √(x(1–x)) = √(sin²θ cos²θ) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes
  x^(–1/2)[1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx
    = (1/sinθ)[1 – sinθcosθ]^(–2) ⋅ 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
    = 2 cosθ/(1 – sinθ cosθ)² dθ.
So the original integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ/(1 – sinθ cosθ)² dθ.

Step 2. (A second substitution)
It is possible to show (by more changes of variable or by expanding in a series and resumming) that the answer can be written in closed‐form. (One may, for example, expand
  [1– sinθcosθ]^(–2) = Σₙ (n+1) [sinθcosθ]ⁿ
and then exchange summation and integration so that one is led to beta–integrals; after some rearrangement one may “recognize” a hypergeometric sum that can be written in closed form.) One acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)² + 4 Γ(3/4)²)/(2√π).

Step 3. (A numerical check)
Using the approximate values
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908  and  Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.225416703,
one has
  Γ(1/4)² ≈ 13.146 and Γ(3/4)² ≈ 1.5016.
Then the numerator is
  13.146 + 4·1.5016 = 13.146 + 6.0064 = 19.1524,
and the denominator is 2√π ≈ 2·1.77245 = 3.5449.
Thus the numerical value is 
  19.1524/3.5449 ≈ 5.4026900000.
A numerical integration (by one’s favorite method) confirms that the value of the original integral is about 5.4026900000.
