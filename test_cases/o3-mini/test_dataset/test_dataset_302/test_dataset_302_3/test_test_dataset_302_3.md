We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) (0.5² – x²)^(–1/2) · arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.) In our derivation we shall use a substitution so that the answer can eventually be written in a “nice” form.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. The first substitution

Define
  x = 0.5 sin θ  ⟹ dx = 0.5 cos θ dθ.
When x = 0, we have θ = 0 and when x = 0.5 we have sin θ = 1 (so that θ = π/2).

Note that
  0.5² – x² = 0.25 – 0.25 sin² θ = 0.25 cos² θ,
so that
  (0.5² – x²)^(–1/2) = 1/(0.5 cos θ) = 2/ cos θ.

Then the integrand times dx becomes

  (2/cos θ) · arcsin(0.5x) · (0.5 cos θ dθ)
    = (2 · 0.5/cos θ · cos θ) · arcsin(0.5x) dθ
    = 1 · arcsin(0.5x) dθ.

But with x = 0.5 sin θ we have

  0.5x = 0.5·(0.5 sin θ) = 0.25 sin θ.
Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(0.25 sin θ) dθ.

Step 2. Recognizing a standard integral

The integral

  J(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(m sin θ) dθ
(with a constant parameter m) is known to have a closed‐form answer. In fact, one may show (by differentiating under the integral sign with respect to m and then reintegrating) that

  J(m) = (π/2) · arcsin (m/√(1 + m²)).
A quick check shows:
 • When m = 0 the right‐side is 0,
 • When m = 1 one obtains (π/2)·arcsin(1/√2) = (π/2)·(π/4) = π²/8,
which is indeed the value of ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(sin θ) dθ (since for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 we have arcsin(sin θ) = θ).

In our case m = 1/4 so that

  I = (π/2) · arcsin ((1/4)/√(1 + (1/4)²)).
Since 1 + (1/4)² = 1 + 1/16 = 17/16 we have
  √(1 + (1/4)²) = √(17/16) = √17/4.
Thus,
  (1/4)/(√17/4) = 1/√17,
and our answer becomes

  I = (π/2) · arcsin (1/√17).

Step 3. The numerical value

It remains only to give a numerical approximation. We have

  √17 ≈ 4.1231056256 ⟹ 1/√17 ≈ 0.2425356250.
Then
  arcsin(0.2425356250) ≈ 0.2449786631   (radians)
and finally
  (π/2) ≈ 1.5707963268   so that

  I ≈ 1.5707963268 × 0.2449786631 ≈ 0.3849001830.

Step 4. Final answer in JSON

The final answer is:

  I = (π/2) · arcsin (1/√17)     with I ≈ 0.3849001830.
 
Therefore, the output in the required JSON format is as follows:

{"answer": "(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\arcsin\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{17}}", "numerical_answer": "0.3849001830"}
