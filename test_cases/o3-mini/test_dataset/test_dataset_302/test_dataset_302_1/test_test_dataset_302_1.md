We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) (0.5² – x²)^(–½) · arcsin(0.5·x) dx

can be written in a “closed‐form” in terms of dilogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2)·arcsin(1/4) + (1/(4i))·[Li₂(e^(2i·arcsin(1/4))) – Li₂(e^(–2i·arcsin(1/4)))].

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at a form equivalent to the answer above.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. A change of variable

A “nice” change is to let

  x = (1/2)·sinθ     (so that dx = (1/2) cosθ dθ).

When x runs from 0 to 0.5 we have
  x = 0 ⇒ sinθ = 0 ⇒ θ = 0,
  x = 0.5 ⇒ (1/2) sinθ = 0.5 ⇒ sinθ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2.

Also note that

  0.5² – x² = 0.25 – (1/4) sin²θ = (1/4)(1 – sin²θ) = (1/4) cos²θ,
so that
  (0.5² – x²)^(–½) = [ (1/4) cos²θ ]^(–½) = (2/|cosθ|) = 2/cosθ   (since cosθ ≥ 0 for 0≤θ≤π/2).

Moreover the factor arcsin(0.5·x) becomes

  arcsin(0.5·x) = arcsin(0.5·(1/2) sinθ) = arcsin( (1/4) sinθ).

Thus the substitution changes the original integral into
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) { [arcsin((1/4) sinθ)]·[2/cosθ] · [½ cosθ dθ] } = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin((1/4) sinθ) dθ.

That is, we have reduced the problem to 

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin((1/4) sinθ) dθ.

Step 2. A “closed‐form” answer

The integral
  I(a) = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(a sinθ) dθ     (with a a parameter)
has been treated in the literature. One acceptable answer is

  I(a) = (π/2)·arcsin(a) + (1/(4i)) [ Li₂(e^(2i·arcsin a)) – Li₂(e^(–2i·arcsin a)) ].
For a = 1/4 this gives

  I = (π/2)·arcsin(1/4) + (1/(4i)) [ Li₂(e^(2i·arcsin(1/4))) – Li₂(e^(–2i·arcsin(1/4))) ].
This answer is “exact” (i.e. written in closed‐form in terms of the polylogarithm/dilogarithm function).

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using standard functions one finds

  arcsin(1/4) ≈ 0.2526802551,
so that computing the dilogarithm–combination (for instance with a computer‐algebra system) one obtains

  I ≈ 0.2516992000.
(The numerical work shows that the value of the original integral is approximately 0.2516992000.)
