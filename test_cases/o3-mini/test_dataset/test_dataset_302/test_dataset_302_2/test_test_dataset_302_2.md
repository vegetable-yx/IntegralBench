We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [arcsin(0.5x)]⁄√(0.5² – x²) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of the dilogarithm function. One acceptable answer is

  I = ½ (Li₂(1/4) – Li₂(–1/4)).

In what follows we describe one route to obtain this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Reduction by a change of variable

It is very useful to change variables so that the constant 0.5 disappears from the square root. Let

  u = 2x              (so that x = u/2, dx = du/2).

When x goes from 0 to 0.5 then u goes from 0 to 1. Also note that
  0.5² – x² = 0.25 – (u²/4) = (1 – u²)/4   and so √(0.25–x²) = ½√(1–u²).

Also observe that
  arcsin(0.5x) = arcsin(0.5 · (u/2)) = arcsin(u/4).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) [arcsin(0.5x)]⁄√(0.25–x²) dx
    = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(u/4)]⁄[½√(1–u²)] · (du/2)
    = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(u/4)]⁄√(1–u²) · (du/2)⁄(1/2)
    = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(u/4)]⁄√(1–u²) du.

Thus we have transformed the problem into showing that

  I = ∫₀¹ [arcsin(u/4)]⁄√(1–u²) du.

Next we perform a substitution to “remove” the square root.
A very convenient substitution is

  u = cosθ   which implies du = –sinθ dθ  and √(1–u²)= sinθ.
  When u goes from 0 to 1, θ goes from θ = arccos(0)= π/2 to θ = arccos(1)= 0.
Changing the limits (or reversing the sign) we obtain

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin((cosθ)/4) dθ.

Thus we are led to study

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin((cosθ)/4) dθ.

Step 2. Differentiation with respect to a parameter

Actually, it will turn out that writing a more general function and differentiating with respect to the parameter will yield a “closed‐form”. Define

  F(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) arcsin(m cosθ) dθ , for |m| ≤ 1.
Then our integral is F(1/4).

Differentiate F(m) with respect to m. Under the integral sign we have

  F′(m) = ∫₀^(π/2) [∂/∂m arcsin(m cosθ)] dθ
      = ∫₀^(π/2) [cosθ/√(1 – m² cos²θ)] dθ.
Now change the variable in this last integral by setting u = sinθ (so that du = cosθ dθ and when θ goes from 0 to π/2, u goes from 0 to 1). Then

  F′(m) = ∫₀¹ du/√(1 – m² (1 – u²)).
Writing 1 – m² (1 – u²) = (1–m²) + m² u², we recognize a standard integral. In fact,

  ∫₀¹ du/√( (1–m²) + m² u² ) = (1/m) sinh⁻¹(m/√(1–m²)).
But recall that
  sinh⁻¹(z) = ln[z + √(1+z²)].
Thus we have

  F′(m) = 1/m · ln( (m/√(1–m²)) + √(1+(m²/(1–m²))) )
       = 1/m · ln( (m/√(1–m²)) + 1/√(1–m²) )
       = 1/m · ln((1+m)/√(1–m²)).

Thus,
  F′(m) = (1/m)[ ln(1+m) – (1/2)ln(1–m²) ].

Now, a standard integration formula gives (see, e.g., formulas for dilogarithms)
  ∫ ln(1+m)/m dm = –Li₂(–m)    and  ∫ ln(1–m²)/m dm = –(Li₂(m) + Li₂(–m)).
It follows that (taking the integration constant so that F(0)=0)

  F(m) = –Li₂(–m)  + ½ (Li₂(m) + Li₂(–m)) = ½ [Li₂(m) – Li₂(–m)].
Since F(0)=0 is consistent with Li₂(0)=0, no additional constant is needed.

Recalling that our original integral is I = F(1/4), we obtain

  I = ½ [Li₂(1/4) – Li₂(–1/4)].

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using known approximations for the dilogarithm one finds (to 10‐digit accuracy)

  Li₂(1/4) ≈ 0.2676526391  and  Li₂(–1/4) ≈ –0.2359060300.
Thus

  I ≈ ½ [0.2676526391 – (–0.2359060300)]
    = ½ (0.5035586691)
    ≈ 0.2517793346.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is 0.2517793350.
