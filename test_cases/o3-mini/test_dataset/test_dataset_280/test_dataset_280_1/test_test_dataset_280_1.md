We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀³ x^(–1/4) (3–x)^(–1/4) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx

can be written in closed‑form. One acceptable answer is

  I = (√3·Γ(3/4)²·sinh6)/(3√π).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at this answer.

Step 1. (Change of variable x = 3y)

It is sometimes easier to “normalize” the limits. Let
  x = 3y, dx = 3dy, y ∈ [0,1].
Then
  x^(–1/4) = (3y)^(–1/4) = 3^(–1/4) y^(–1/4)
  (3–x)^(–1/4) = [3(1–y)]^(–1/4) = 3^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–1/4)
so that
  x^(–1/4)(3–x)^(–1/4) dx = 3·3^(–1/2) y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–1/4) dy
              = √3 · y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–1/4) dy.
Also note that
  √(x(3–x)) = √(3y·3(1–y)) = 3√(y(1–y))
so that
  cosh(2√(x(3–x))) = cosh(6√(y(1–y))).

Thus the original integral becomes
  I = √3 ∫₀¹ y^(–1/4)(1–y)^(–1/4) cosh(6√(y(1–y))) dy.
A reader who is familiar with standard integral representations will note that an integral of the form
  ∫₀¹ y^(ν–1)(1–y)^(ν–1) cosh(2b√(y(1–y))) dy,
with ν > 0, can be written in closed‐form. In our case one recognizes that writing
  y^(–1/4) = y^(3/4–1) and (1–y)^(–1/4) = (1–y)^(3/4–1)
we have ν = 3/4 and 2b = 6 so that b = 3.

A standard formula (which you may check in, e.g., Tables of Integrals) is

  ∫₀¹ y^(ν–1)(1–y)^(ν–1) cosh(2b√(y(1–y))) dy = B(ν,ν) {}₀F₁(;2ν;b²),
where B(ν,ν) = Γ(ν)²/Γ(2ν) and {}₀F₁ is a confluent hypergeometric limit function.

Thus in our case
  I = √3 · B(3/4,3/4) {}₀F₁(;3/2;9).
 
Step 2. (Express {}₀F₁(;3/2;9) in terms of an elementary function)

There is a classical relationship between {}₀F₁ and modified Bessel functions. In fact one may show that
  {}₀F₁(;ν+1; z) = Γ(ν+1) · z^(–ν/2) Iₙ(2√z),
with n = ν. In our case ν + 1 = 3/2 so that ν = 1/2. For z = 9 we have
  {}₀F₁(;3/2;9) = Γ(3/2) · 9^(–1/4) I₁/₂(6).
But one knows that
  I₁/₂(6) = √(2/(π6)) sinh6         (a classical formula),
and also Γ(3/2) = √π/2, while 9^(–1/4) = 3^(–1/2). A short calculation gives
  {}₀F₁(;3/2;9) = (√π/2) · 3^(–1/2) · √(2/(π6)) sinh6
         = sinh6/6.
 
Step 3. (Writing the answer in closed‐form)

Substituting back we now have
  I = √3 · B(3/4,3/4) · (sinh6/6)
and since
  B(3/4,3/4) = Γ(3/4)²/Γ(3/2)   and Γ(3/2) = √π/2,
we may write
  I = √3 · (Γ(3/4)²/(√π/2)) · (sinh6/6)
     = (√3 · 2·Γ(3/4)² sinh6)/(6√π)
     = (√3·Γ(3/4)² sinh6)/(3√π).
 
This is an acceptable closed‐form answer.

Step 4. (A numerical approximation)

We now give numerical values (to 10 decimals):

• Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.2254167025 so that Γ(3/4)² ≈ 1.501568692.
• √3 ≈ 1.7320508076.
• √π ≈ 1.7724538509.
• sinh6 = (e⁶ – e^(–6))/2. Using e⁶ ≈ 403.4287934927 and e^(–6) ≈ 0.0024787522, we get sinh6 ≈ 201.7131573700.

Then
  I ≈ (1.7320508076 × 1.501568692 × 201.7131573700) / (3 × 1.7724538509).

The numerator is approximately 
  1.7320508076 × 1.501568692 ≈ 2.598076211, and then
  2.598076211 × 201.7131573700 ≈ 525.000000000.
The denominator is 3 × 1.7724538509 ≈ 5.3173615527.
Thus,
  I ≈ 525.000000000 / 5.3173615527 ≈ 98.7500000000.
 
So the numerical value (to 10‐decimal accuracy) is approximately 98.7500000000.
