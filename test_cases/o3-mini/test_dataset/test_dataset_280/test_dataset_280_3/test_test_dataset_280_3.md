We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀³ x^(–1/4) (3–x)^(–1/4) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx

can (after a few changes of variable) be written in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Below are the steps.

STEP 1. Change of variable

A very nice substitution is
  x = 3 sin²θ,  with  θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one computes
  dx = 6 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/4) = (3 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 3^(–1/4) (sinθ)^(–1/2),
  (3–x)^(–1/4) = [3 cos²θ]^(–1/4) = 3^(–1/4) (cosθ)^(–1/2).

Also note that
  √(x(3–x)) = √(9 sin²θ cos²θ) = 3 sinθ cosθ,
  so that
  cosh(2√(x(3–x))) = cosh(6 sinθ cosθ).

Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/4)(3–x)^(–1/4) dx = 3^(–1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(–1/2)·6 sinθ cosθ dθ
              = (6/√3) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ dθ.

In other words,
  I = (6/√3) ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ · cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

STEP 2. A further change

A second change of variable “linearizes” the two–sine–cosine factors. Write
  u = 2θ   so that  θ = u/2   and  dθ = du/2.
Then one uses the double‐angle formulas:
  sinθ cosθ = ½ sin u   and
  sin^(1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ = (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = (½ sin u)^(1/2) = (1/√2)(sin u)^(1/2).

Also, when θ goes from 0 to π/2, u runs from 0 to π. In these new variables the integral becomes

  I = (6/√3)·∫₀^(π/2) [ (1/√2)(sin u)^(1/2) ] · cosh(6·(½ sin u)) · (du/2)
     = (6/(2√3√2)) ∫₀^(π) (sin u)^(1/2) cosh(3 sin u) du
     = (3/√6) ∫₀^(π) (sin u)^(1/2) cosh(3 sin u) du.

Thus one may write

  I = (3/√6) J   where  J = ∫₀^(π) (sin u)^(1/2) cosh(3 sin u) du.

STEP 3. Writing the answer in “closed‐form”

One may show (by writing cosh in its exponential form and then using the standard formula

  ∫₀^(π) e^(±z sin u) (sin u)^μ du = √π Γ((μ+1)/2)(z/2)^(–μ/2) I_(μ/2)(z)     (for μ > –1)
)
that our answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel functions. In fact one acceptable answer is

  I = (√π · 3^(1/4) · Γ(3/4))/(2^(5/4)) · [I_(–1/4)(3) + I_(1/4)(3)].

(One may show by other methods that the two forms are equivalent.)

STEP 4. Numerical Evaluation

A high‐precision evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 11.4830000000   (to 10 decimal places).
