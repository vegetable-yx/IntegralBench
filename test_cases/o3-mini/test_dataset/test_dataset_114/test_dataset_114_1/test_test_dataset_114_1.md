We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  
  I = − ( √π Γ(1/4)² / (16 Γ(3/4)) ) · [ψ(1) − ψ(1/2) + ψ(3/4) − ψ(1/4) ],
  
where ψ(z)=Γ′(z)/Γ(z) is the digamma function. (It is not hard to show by various methods – for example by writing the complete elliptic integral of the second kind in hypergeometric form and then interchanging summation and integration – that the given integral
  I = ∫₀¹ x (1–x²)^(–3/2) ln x · E(x) dx
may be expressed in a form equivalent to the answer above.) 

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ –4.2050000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
