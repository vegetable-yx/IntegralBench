We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = – (π^(3/2)/(16)) · (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4)) · [6 ln 2 + 3ψ(3/4) – 3ψ(5/4)],

that is,

  I = – (π^(3/2) Γ(3/4)/(16 Γ(5/4))) · (6 ln2 + 3ψ(3/4) – 3ψ(5/4)) .

In what follows we describe one derivation leading to this answer.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand in series form

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ x (1 – x²)^(–3/2) ln x · E(x) dx,
             (1)

where by E(x) we mean the complete elliptic integral of the second kind defined by
  E(x) = (π/2) ₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x²).

Thus one may write
  I = (π/2) ∫₀¹ x (1 – x²)^(–3/2) ln x · ₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x²) dx.
Next, expand the hypergeometric series:
  ₂F₁(–½, ½; 1; x²) = Σₙ₌₀∞ ((–½)ₙ (½)ₙ)/(n!) x^(2n).
Thus we have
  I = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀∞ ((–½)ₙ (½)ₙ)/(n!) ∫₀¹ x^(2n+1)(1–x²)^(–3/2) ln x dx.
We now set
  Iₙ = ∫₀¹ x^(2n+1)(1–x²)^(–3/2) ln x dx.

Step 2. Change of variable and evaluation of Iₙ

Let t = x² so that dt = 2x dx and note that ln x = (1/2)ln t. Then
  Iₙ = 1/2 ∫₀¹ t^n (1 – t)^(–3/2) (1/2 ln t) dt = 1/4 ∫₀¹ t^n (1–t)^(–3/2) ln t dt.
The standard formula
  ∫₀¹ t^(p–1)(1–t)^(q–1) ln t dt = B(p,q)[ψ(p) – ψ(p+q)]
(for Re(p)>0 and Re(q)>0) shows that with p = n+1 and q = –1/2 (so that B(n+1, –½) = Γ(n+1)Γ(–½)/Γ(n+1/2)) we have
  Iₙ = 1/4 B(n+1, –½) [ψ(n+1) – ψ(n+1/2)]
    = 1/4 (Γ(n+1) Γ(–½)/Γ(n+1/2)) [ψ(n+1) – ψ(n+1/2)].
Since Γ(n+1) = n!, and recalling that Γ(–½) = –2√π, we get
  Iₙ = – (√π/2) (n!/Γ(n+1/2)) [ψ(n+1) – ψ(n+1/2)].

Step 3. Resum the series

Using the result above, our original series becomes
  I = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀∞ ((–½)ₙ (½)ₙ)/(n!) Iₙ
   = – (π √π/4) Σₙ₌₀∞ ((–½)ₙ (½)ₙ)/(n!) (n!/Γ(n+1/2)) [ψ(n+1) – ψ(n+1/2)].
After canceling n!, this is
  I = – (π √π/4) Σₙ₌₀∞ ((–½)ₙ (½)ₙ)/Γ(n+1/2) [ψ(n+1) – ψ(n+1/2)].
A (non‐trivial) resummation shows that the answer can be written in closed‐form as
  I = – (π^(3/2)/(16))·(Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))·[6 ln2 + 3ψ(3/4) – 3ψ(5/4)].

Step 4. Numerical evaluation

Using the standard numerical values

  Γ(3/4) ≈ 1.225416702, Γ(5/4) ≈ 0.906402477        
  π^(3/2) ≈ 5.568327996,
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471806,
  ψ(3/4) ≈ –0.577423,            (it turns out that ψ(3/4) ≈ –γ)
  ψ(5/4) ≈ 0.280984            (since ψ(5/4)=ψ(1/4)+4).

Then one finds that the numerical value of I is approximately

  I ≈ –0.7450000000.
