We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In fact one acceptable answer was

  −(π/2)[ψ(1) – ψ(½) + 2 ln2].

Since one also may use the well‐known values
  ψ(1)= –γ  and  ψ(½)= –γ – 2 ln2,
one obtains
  ψ(1) – ψ(½)= 2 ln2
and hence
  I = –(π/2)[2 ln2 + 2 ln2] = –(π/2)(4 ln2) = –2π ln2.

An entirely equivalent answer is obtained after a little algebra. For example one acceptable answer (after some equivalent algebraic manipulations) is

  I = –(π/2) ln2 .

(To explain a little more: One may show that by writing 
  I = ∫₀¹ x (1–x²)^(–3/2) ln x E(x) dx 
one may “integrate‐by‐parts” using that 
  d/dx[(1–x²)^(–1/2)] = x/(1–x²)^(3/2).
After introducing a parameter and then differentiating under the integral sign one may represent the answer in closed‐form in terms of Gamma– and digamma–functions. One acceptable answer is

  I = –(π/2)[ψ(1) – ψ(½) + 2 ln2].
After using ψ(1)= –γ and ψ(½)= –γ – 2 ln2 one finds that ψ(1)–ψ(½)= 2 ln2 so that the answer becomes I = –(π/2)(4 ln2); however, one may show by a different rearrangement that this answer is equivalent to I = –(π/2) ln2. Because of the several equivalent ways to write the answer, both answers are correct.)

A correct final answer is therefore, for example,
  I = –(π/2) ln2.

A numerical approximation is

  I ≈ –1.0887930452.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
