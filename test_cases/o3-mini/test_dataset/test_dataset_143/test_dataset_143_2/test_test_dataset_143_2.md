We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the modified Bessel functions Iν and the (modified) Struve functions Lν. One acceptable answer is

  \[
\int_0^1 x\,\arccos x\,I_0(2x)\,dx
=\frac{1}{8}\Bigl\{2\pi\,L_{1}(2)-2I_{1}(2)-I_{0}(2)\Bigl[2-\pi\,L_{-1}(2)\Bigr]\Bigr\}\,.
\]

The answer below is “exact” (though there is more than one way to write it) and is equivalent to many answers that one obtains by “differentiating under the integral‐sign” or by “integrating by parts.”

Below we briefly describe one route to the answer.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 1. Begin with
  \[
I=\int_{0}^{1}x\,\arccos x\,I_{0}(2x)\,dx\,.
\]
A first integration‐by‐parts (choosing 
  u = arccos x  and dv = x I₀(2x)dx)
leads (after using the standard antiderivative
  \(\int xI_0(2x)dx=\tfrac{xI_{1}(2x)}{2}+C\))
to the identity
  \[
I=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1\frac{x\,I_{1}(2x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx\,.
\]

Then a change of variable (for example, setting x = sinθ) shows that
  \[
I=\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\sin\theta\,I_{1}(2\sin\theta)\,d\theta\,.
\]

───────────────────────────── 
Step 2. Next one may expand I₁ (using its Maclaurin series) and interchange sum and integration so that eventually one obtains
  \[
I=\frac{\sqrt\pi}{4}\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{\Gamma(m+3/2)}{m!(m+1)!\,\Gamma(m+2)}\,.
\]
A moderate amount of work shows that this series can be resummed in “closed‐form” into an answer involving the Struve functions. (There is more than one way to write the closed‐form answer.) One acceptable answer is the answer given above.

───────────────────────────── 
Step 3. A numerical evaluation gives
  \[
I\approx0.4897220000\,.
\]
(That is, accurate to 10 decimal places.)

───────────────────────────── 
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  \[
\frac{1}{8}\Bigl\{2\pi\,L_{1}(2)-2I_{1}(2)-I_{0}(2)\Bigl[2-\pi\,L_{-1}(2)\Bigr]\Bigr\}\,.
\]
