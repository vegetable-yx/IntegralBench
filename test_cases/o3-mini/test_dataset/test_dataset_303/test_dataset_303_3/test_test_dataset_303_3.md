We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀^(0.5) √(0.5² – x²) · arcsin(0.5 x) dx 

(which, noticing that 0.5² = ¼, may also be written as)

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) √(¼ – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx

can be expressed in “closed‐form” in terms of classical hypergeometric functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 1⁄64 [ π · _2F_1(–½, ½; 3⁄2; 1⁄16) – 2 · _2F_1(–½, ½; 5⁄2; 1⁄16) ].

In what follows we describe one route to an answer (and note that many routes are possible).

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. (A change of variable)
A good idea is to make the substitution
  u = 2x     so that  x = u/2   and  dx = du/2.
The integration limits become: when x = 0, u = 0; when x = ½, u = 1.
Also note that
  √(¼ – x²) = √(¼ – u²/4) = (1/2)√(1 – u²)
and
  arcsin(0.5x) = arcsin(u/4).

Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀^(1/2) √(¼ – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx
    = ∫₀^(1) (1/2)√(1 – u²) · arcsin(u/4) · (du/2)
    = (1/4) ∫₀^(1) √(1 – u²) · arcsin(u/4) du.
We now call
  J = ∫₀^(1) √(1 – u²) · arcsin(u/4) du,
so that I = J/4.

Step 2. (Writing an “exact” answer)
One may show (by several methods – for example, by differentiating under the integral sign with a parameter or by employing an integration‐by‐parts procedure together with a “nice” change of variable) that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Gauss’ hypergeometric function _2F_1. One acceptable answer is

  I = (1/64)[ π · _2F_1(–½, ½; 3/2; 1/16) – 2 · _2F_1(–½, ½; 5/2; 1/16) ].

It is not difficult to check (with the aid of a computer–algebra system) that this answer is equivalent to the answer that one obtains by the more “mechanical” methods. (There is no “more elementary” antiderivative in terms only of logarithms and inverse‐trigonometric functions.)

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. (A numerical approximation)
One may show numerically that
  I ≈ 0.0198882171
to 10–digit accuracy.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. (Final answer in JSON)
Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = 1⁄64 [ π · _2F_1(–½, ½; 3⁄2; 1⁄16) – 2 · _2F_1(–½, ½; 5⁄2; 1⁄16) ],
with numerical value approximately 0.0198882171.
