We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/64)·√π · [Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4)] · ₂F₁(–1/2, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16)
     – (1/32) · ₂F₁(–1/2, 3/4; 5/4; 1/16).

In other words, defining

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) √(0.5² – x²) · arcsin(0.5x) dx,
one may show that

  I = (1/64)√π·(Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4))·₂F₁(–½, ¼; ¾; 1/16)
    – (1/32)·₂F₁(–½, ¾; 5/4; 1/16).

A short outline of one route to an “exact” answer is as follows:

1. One may first make the change of variable
  x = (1/2) sin θ      (so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2),
so that
  dx = (1/2) cos θ dθ   and √(0.25 – x²) = (1/2) cos θ.
Then one obtains
  I = 0.25 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · arcsin(0.25 sin θ) dθ.

2. Next one may try (for example) integration‐by‐parts and/or an expansion in series. After some work one obtains an antiderivative in “closed‐form” which may be rearranged into an answer in terms of hypergeometric functions.

3. One acceptable final answer is that given above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0205761163  (to 10 decimal places).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
