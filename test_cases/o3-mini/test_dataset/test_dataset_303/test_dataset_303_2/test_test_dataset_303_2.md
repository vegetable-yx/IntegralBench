One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical special functions. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(64 Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/16)
    – (1/32) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16).

One may show that

  ∫₀^(1/2) √(0.5² – x²) arcsin(0.5x) dx
    = (√π Γ(3/4))/(64 Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/16)
      – (1/32) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16).

A short outline of one way to arrive at an answer of this type is as follows:

1. One first makes the substitution 
  x = (1/2) sinθ  (so that dx = (1/2)cosθ dθ)
which changes the limits from x = 0 and 1/2 into θ = 0 and π/2. Then one obtains
  I = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · arcsin((1/2)(sinθ/2)) dθ 
     = 1/4 ∫₀^(π/2) cos²θ · arcsin(sinθ/4) dθ.
This form – though not “elementary” – can be manipulated (for example by writing the inverse‐sine in its series form and interchanging summation and integration, or by using standard integral–representation techniques) so that the answer is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions.

2. One may show that the answer may be written in closed‐form as

  I = (√π Γ(3/4))/(64 Γ(5/4)) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 5/4; 1/16)
    – (1/32) · _2F_1(–½, 1/4; 3/4; 1/16).

3. A high–precision numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0203000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
