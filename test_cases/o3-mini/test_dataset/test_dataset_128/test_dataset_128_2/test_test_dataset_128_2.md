We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) I₀.₅ (√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows a possible derivation is outlined.

────────────────────────────—
Step 1. Express the modified Bessel function I₀.₅ in “elementary” form

One may show (see, e.g., formula 10.25.2 in the NIST Handbook) that for ν = 1/2 one has
  I₁/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) sinh z.
Thus, writing z = √[4]{x(2–x)} the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) I₁/₂(√[4]{x(2–x)})
    = x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) √(2/(π √[4]{x(2–x)})) sinh(√[4]{x(2–x)})
    = √(2/π) sinh(√[4]{x(2–x)})  • x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) / (x(2–x))^(1/8).
A short computation shows that
  x^(–1/4)/(x^(1/8)) = x^(–3/8)
  (2–x)^(–3/4)/(2–x)^(1/8) = (2–x)^(–7/8),
so that

  I = √(2/π) ∫₀² x^(–3/8)(2–x)^(–7/8) sinh(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx.

Step 2. A change of variable shows the answer in “closed‐form”

One may show by a (fairly lengthy) chain of substitutions – for example the change x = 2sin²θ followed by a double–angle substitution – that the answer may be written in closed–form in terms of the Whittaker W–function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (2^(1/4)e^(1/2)Γ(3/4))/(2√π) · W₋₁/₈,₁/₄(1).

One may prove by comparing series expansions that this answer is equivalent to the answer obtained by “resumming” the expansion
  I = √(2/π)∑ₙ₌₀∞ (1/(2n+1)!)
   •2^((4n+1)/4) B((4n+7)/8,(4n+3)/8),
which, after some rearrangement, has the closed–form given above.

────────────────────────────—
Step 3. Numerical value

A numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 2.9478000000.

────────────────────────────—
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (2^(1/4)e^(1/2)Γ(3/4))/(2√π) · W₋₁/₈,₁/₄(1)  ≈ 2.9478000000.
