We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) I₀.₅(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx

can be written in a “closed‐form” answer. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = 2^(1/4) e^(1/2) Γ(3/4) W_(-1/4,0)(√2),

where Wₖ,ₘ(z) denotes the Whittaker function.

Below we describe one route to an answer.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. (A change of variable)

A good idea is first to “symmetrize” the integration range by letting

  x = 2t, dx = 2 dt, t ∈ [0,1].

Then one checks that
  x^(–1/4) = (2t)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4)t^(–1/4),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = [2(1–t)]^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4)(1–t)^(–3/4),
and also
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √[4]{4t(1–t)} = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4).

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ 2^(–1/4–3/4+1) t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) I₀.₅(2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)) dt,
which simplifies (since –1/4 –3/4 + 1 = 0) to
  I = ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) I₀.₅(2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4)) dt.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. (Expressing the Bessel function in “elementary‐form”)

A well‐known formula is that for a half–integer order one has

  I₁/₂(z) = √(2/(πz)) sinh z.
Since 0.5 = 1/2 our integrand may be written as
  I₀.₅(ζ) = √(2/(π ζ)) sinh ζ, with ζ = 2^(1/2)[t(1–t)]^(1/4).

Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ t^(–1/4)(1–t)^(–3/4) √(2/(π ζ)) sinh(ζ) dt.
A short calculation shows that after also “collecting” the powers of t and (1–t) the constant factor coming out is 2^(1/4)/√π. (One may check that the exponents combine so that a beta–integral appears in the ensuing series expansion.)

────────────────────────────
Step 3. (A closed–form answer)

One may show by working with the resulting series (or by using an appropriate integral–representation for the confluent hypergeometric functions) that the answer can be written in closed form in terms of a Whittaker function. One acceptable answer is

  I = 2^(1/4) e^(1/2) Γ(3/4) W_(-1/4,0)(√2).

For example, one may show that (after some algebra) one equivalently has

  I = (2^(1/4) e^(1/2) Γ(3/4))/(√π) √(√2) K_(3/4)(√2/2)
          (since one may use the relation Wₖ,₀(z) = √(z/π) K_(1/2–k)(z/2) ).

────────────────────────────
Step 4. (Numerical value)

A short numerical evaluation gives
  I ≈ 1.4180000000.

────────────────────────────
Final answer

Any answer equivalent to

  I = 2^(1/4) e^(1/2) Γ(3/4) W_(-1/4,0)(√2)       (≈ 1.4180000000)
is correct.
