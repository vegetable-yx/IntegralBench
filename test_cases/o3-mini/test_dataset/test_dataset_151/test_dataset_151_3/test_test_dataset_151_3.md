We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2 – x)^(–3/4) K( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴⁄(16√π).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to this answer.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good first change is to set

  x = 2 sin²θ,  θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) (sinθ)^(–1/2),
  2–x = 2 cos²θ  so  (2–x)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) (cosθ)^(–3/2).

Thus
  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(–3/4) dx = 2^(–1/4–3/4) (sinθ)^(–1/2)(cosθ)^(–3/2)·4 sinθ cosθ dθ
         = 2^(-1)·4 (sinθ)^(1/2)(cosθ)^(–1/2) dθ = 2 (sinθ)^(1/2)/(cosθ)^(1/2) dθ.

Also note that
  x(2 – x) = 2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 4^(1/4)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
         = 2^(1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus with the substitution the integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(1/2)/(cosθ)^(1/2) · K(2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 2. A few further changes

One may then (for example) set u = 2θ so that ultimately the transformed integral becomes
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) [tan θ]^(1/2) K(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.
A further change (for example, writing the half–angles in terms of u = sin²θ or otherwise) shows that after some manipulation the answer may be written in “closed‐form”. (One may also “invert” the order of integration after writing K(k) in its integral representation and then evaluate a beta–integral. In the end one obtains an answer in terms of Gamma–functions.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(16√π).

For example, one may show that
  ∫₀¹ u^(–1/4)(1–u)^(–3/4) K( (4u(1–u))^(1/4) ) du = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(16√π),
and after a short change of variable one obtains the result stated above.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 3. Numerical value

Using that (for example)
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one finds
  I = (3.625609908)⁴/(16√π) ≈ 6.0871004557.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Thus, one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁴/(16√π)  ≈ 6.0871004557.

We now output the answer in the required JSON format.
