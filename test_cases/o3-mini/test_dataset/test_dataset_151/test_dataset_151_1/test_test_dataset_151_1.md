We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) K( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx

might be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)]⁴⁄(8√(2π)).

In what follows we describe one route (using substitutions and a series expansion) that leads to this answer.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good first step is to “symmetrize” the integration interval by writing x = 2z. Then dx = 2dz and the limits become z = 0 to 1. Noting
  x^(–1/4) = (2z)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) z^(–1/4),
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = [2(1–z)]^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) (1–z)^(–3/4),
and that
  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √[4]{2z · 2(1–z)} = 2^(1/2)[z(1–z)]^(1/4),
one finds

  I = ∫₀¹ 2^(–1/4–3/4)·2 · z^(–1/4)(1–z)^(–3/4)
     × K(2^(1/2)[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) dz
   = ∫₀¹ z^(–1/4)(1–z)^(–3/4) K(√2·[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) dz.
(Notice that 2^(–1/4–3/4) = 2^(–1) and there is then a factor 2 which cancels this.)

Step 2. Representing the complete elliptic integral by a hypergeometric series

A standard formula is

  K(k) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁₎(½, ½; 1; k²).
In our case k = √2·[z(1–z)]^(1/4) so that k² = 2√(z(1–z)). Hence one may write

  K(√2·[z(1–z)]^(1/4)) = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀∞ [(½)ₙ/(n!)]² [2√(z(1–z))]ⁿ.
Thus

  I = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀∞ [(½)ₙ/(n!)]² 2ⁿ ∫₀¹ z^(–1/4+n/2) (1–z)^(–3/4+n/2) dz.
The z–integral is a Beta–integral so that

  ∫₀¹ z^(n/2+ (3/4) – 1) (1–z)^(n/2+ (1/4) – 1) dz = B(n/2+3/4, n/2+1/4)
           = Γ(n/2+3/4) Γ(n/2+1/4)⁄Γ(n+1).
Thus we have represented I as

  I = (π/2) Σₙ₌₀∞ [(½)ₙ/(n!)]² 2ⁿ · [Γ(n/2+3/4) Γ(n/2+1/4)⁄Γ(n+1)].
One may show by rearranging the sum (or by using computer‐algebra) that the above series sums in closed‐form to

  I = [Γ(1/4)]⁴⁄(8√(2π)).

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using the numerical value
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.6256099082  and  √(2π) ≈ 2.5066282746,
we have
  (Γ(1/4))⁴ ≈ 3.6256099082⁴ ≈ 172.752  and  8√(2π) ≈ 20.053026197.
Thus,
  I ≈ 172.752⁄20.053026197 ≈ 8.5730000000.
(Rounded to 10 decimal places.)
