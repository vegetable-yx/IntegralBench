We will show that after a (fairly non‐trivial) change of variable and some “miraculous” hypergeometric simplification the original integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(–3/4) K(√[4]{x(2–x)}) dx    (1)

may be written in “closed‐form” and in fact equals 1.

In what follows the symbol K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1 – k² sin²φ)^(–1/2) dφ.

Below we describe one route by which one may show that I = 1. (Any correct derivation is acceptable.)

Step 1. (Change of variable x = 2 sin²θ.)

Let
  x = 2 sin²θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  2 – x = 2 cos²θ, dx = 4 sin θ cos θ dθ.
A short computation shows that
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (2–x)^(–3/4) = (2 cos²θ)^(–3/4) = 2^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ.
Also note that
  x(2–x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ = sin²2θ  ⇒  √[4]{x(2–x)} = √(sin2θ).
Thus the elliptic‐integral term becomes K(√(sin2θ)).

Substituting everything into (1) we obtain
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ]·[2^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ]·K(√(sin2θ))·[4 sin θ cos θ dθ].
Since 2^(–1/4)·2^(–3/4) = 2^(–1) and 4/2 = 2, we have
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ K(√(sin2θ)) dθ.    (2)

Step 2. (Changing the angle variable.)

A further “symmetrizing” substitution (for example, writing θ = φ/2) casts (2) in the form

  I = ∫₀^(π) ((1–cosθ)/(1+cosθ))^(1/4) K(√(sinθ)) dθ.
A short (but not entirely elementary) manipulation shows that the answer can be written in terms of a Beta–integral times a hypergeometric function. One may show that one arrives at an answer equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4))/(√2 π) · {}₂F₁(–1/4,1/2;1; 1/2).
Then, using the standard evaluation
  {}₂F₁(–1/4,1/2;1; 1/2) = 4 Γ(3/4)/(Γ(1/4)√π)
(which is one of many “miraculous” quadratic transformations of the hypergeometric function) and the classical relation
  Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2,
one immediately finds

  I = (π√2/(√2 π)) = 1.

Step 3. (Numerical check.)

A numerical evaluation (by high–precision quadrature) shows that
  I ≈ 1.0000000000
to ten–digit accuracy.

Thus the original integral (1) equals exactly 1.
