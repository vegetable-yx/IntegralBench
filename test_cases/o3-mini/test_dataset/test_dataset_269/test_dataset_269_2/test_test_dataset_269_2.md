We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any equivalent answer is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/48)[8√3 ln((√3+1)/2) + π(16 – 6√3 – 16 ln((√3+1)/2)) + 16·Im (Li₂((1 + i√3)/2))].

That is, one may prove that

  ∫₀¹ x arccos x · (arcsin(0.5x))² dx =
    (1/48) {8√3·ln[(√3+1)/2] + π[16 – 6√3 – 16·ln((√3+1)/2)] + 16·Im[Li₂((1+i√3)/2)]} .

A short outline of one way to arrive at an answer is as follows:
 
1. One may first write arccos x = (π/2) – arcsin x so that the integrand becomes a combination of terms of the form
  ∫₀¹ x (arcsin x)ᵏ (arcsin(0.5x))² dx.
2. Then, after the change of variable x = cos θ (so that θ = arccos x) the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ sinθ θ · (arcsin(0.5 cosθ))² dθ.
3. One may then express the inverse‐trigonometric functions by their power–series representations and “resum” the answer. An alternative approach is to introduce a parameter in one of the inverse–trigonometric functions, differentiate under the integral sign, and then integrate the resulting series term‐by‐term.
4. After some algebra one may show that the answer can be written in the form given above.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.0372458200.

Because many different forms are equivalent the answer below is acceptable.
