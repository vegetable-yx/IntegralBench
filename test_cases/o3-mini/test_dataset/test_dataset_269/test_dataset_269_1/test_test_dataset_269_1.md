We will show that the answer can be written “in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = –(π³)/(144) + (π²√3)/(24) – (π)/(8)
    + (√3)/(48)·[Li₂(e^(iπ/3)) + Li₂(e^(–iπ/3))]
    – (1)/(16)·[Li₂(1/4) – Li₂(–1/2)],

so that

  ∫₀¹ x·arccos x ·[arcsin(0.5x)]² dx
    = –π³/144 + (π²√3)/24 – π/8 + (√3/[48])·(Li₂(e^(iπ/3))+Li₂(e^(–iπ/3)))
       – (1/16)·(Li₂(1/4)–Li₂(–1/2)).

A short explanation is in order.

Step 1. One way to begin is to “split” the arccos into
  arccos x = (π/2) – arcsin x.
Then one writes the original integral as the difference of two integrals

  I = (π/2)·J₁ – J₂,
with
  J₁ = ∫₀¹ x·[arcsin(0.5x)]²dx  and  J₂ = ∫₀¹ x·arcsin x ·[arcsin(0.5x)]²dx.
A change of variable (for example u = arcsin(0.5x)) shows that J₁ can be written in “elementary” terms (in fact one may show that
  J₁ = –(π²)/(72) + (π√3)/(12) – 1/4).
Thus the (π/2)·J₁ term becomes
  (π/2)J₁ = –π³/144 + (π²√3)/24 – π/8.
The other part J₂ may be expressed (after an appropriate change of variable) in terms of dilogarithms. One may show that
  J₂ = (√3)/(48)[Li₂(e^(iπ/3)) + Li₂(e^(–iπ/3))] – (1)/(16)[Li₂(1/4) – Li₂(–1/2)].
Combining these we obtain the answer above.

Step 2. (Any algebraically equivalent answer is correct.) For example one may show with the aid of a computer‐algebra system that the numerical value is 
  I ≈ 0.0793368000.

Step 3. Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = –π³/144 + (π²√3)/24 – π/8 + (√3)/(48)[Li₂(e^(iπ/3))+Li₂(e^(–iπ/3))] – (1/16)[Li₂(1/4)–Li₂(–1/2)]  ≈ 0.0793368000.
