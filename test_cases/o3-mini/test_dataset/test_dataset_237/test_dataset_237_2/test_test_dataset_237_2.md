We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) dx

may be written in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (13π)/(6·3^(1/4)).

In what follows a route to this answer is outlined.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A good change is to set
  x = sin²θ,  with dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
so that when x runs from 0 to 1 the variable θ runs from 0 to π/2. Note that
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ,
and
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand transforms as follows:
  x^(–3/4)(1–x)^(–1/4) dx = sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · 2 sinθ cosθ dθ
                = 2 sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ dθ.
Also,
  [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) = [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–2).

Thus the integral becomes
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–2) dθ.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Writing in standard form

We now write the above integral in the suggestive form

  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2μ–1)(cosθ)^(2ν–1) [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–λ)dθ,
with the choices
  2μ – 1 = –1/2 ⟹ μ = 1/4,
  2ν – 1 = 1/2 ⟹ ν = 3/4,
  λ = 2.
There is a well‐known representation (see, e.g., formulas in Gradstein–Ryzhik or Bailey’s book on hypergeometric integrals) that expresses such integrals in terms of the Beta–function and a Gauss hypergeometric function {}_2F_1. In our case one may show that

  I = B(μ, ν) · {}_2F_1(λ, μ; μ+ν; 1/4),
where B(μ,ν) is the Beta–function.

Since
  μ = 1/4 and ν = 3/4 ⟹ B(1/4,3/4) = Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2,
the answer is written as
  I = (π√2) · {}_2F_1(2, 1/4; 1; 1/4).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. Transforming the hypergeometric function

Now one may use one of the standard transformations. One very acceptable route is to use

  {}_2F_1(a, b; c; z) = (1–z)^(–b) {}_2F_1(c–a, b; c; z/(z–1)),
with a = 2, b = 1/4, c = 1 and z = 1/4. Then

  {}_2F_1(2, 1/4; 1; 1/4)
    = (1–1/4)^(–1/4) {}_2F_1(1–2, 1/4; 1; (1/4)/(–3/4))
    = (3/4)^(–1/4) {}_2F_1(–1, 1/4; 1; –1/3).

But {}_2F_1(–1,1/4;1;w) is a polynomial – indeed, since the first parameter is –1, we have
  {}_2F_1(–1, 1/4; 1; w) = 1 – (1/4)w.
Thus with w = –1/3 we find
  {}_2F_1(–1,1/4;1;–1/3) = 1 – (1/4)(–1/3) = 1 + 1/12 = 13/12.

That is,
  {}_2F_1(2, 1/4; 1; 1/4) = (3/4)^(–1/4) · (13/12) = (13/12) (4/3)^(1/4).

Thus our integral becomes
  I = (π√2) · (13/12) (4/3)^(1/4).

Notice that (4/3)^(1/4) can be written as (2^(2)/3)^(1/4) = 2^(1/2)/3^(1/4) so that

  I = π√2 · (13/12) · (√2/3^(1/4))
     = (13π · 2)/(12 · 3^(1/4))
     = (13π)/(6 · 3^(1/4)).

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Summary and numerical value

Thus we have shown that

  I = (13π)/(6 · 3^(1/4)).

A numerical evaluation gives

  3^(1/4) = e^(0.25 ln 3) ≈ 1.31607401295,
  so I ≈ (13×π)/(6×1.31607401295) ≈ 5.1754444763.
