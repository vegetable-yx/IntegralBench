We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(–3/4) (1–x)^(–1/4) (1–√(x(1–x)))^(–2) dx

can be “evaluated in closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(8√(2π)).

In what follows we describe one way to arrive at an answer expressed in Gamma–functions.

–––––––––––
Step 1. Rewrite the integrand and make a substitution

A good idea is to “remove” the square–root appearing inside the last factor. In our case one may substitute

  x = sin²θ,  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then one finds
  dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–3/4) = (sin²θ)^(–3/4) = sin^(–3/2)θ,
  (1–x)^(–1/4) = (cos²θ)^(–1/4) = cos^(–1/2)θ,
and also
  √(x(1–x)) = sinθ cosθ.
Thus the bracket becomes
  [1 – √(x(1–x))]^(–2) = [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–2).
So the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–2) (2 sinθ cosθ dθ).
A short calculation shows that
  sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–1/2)θ · (sinθ cosθ)
    = sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ.
Hence
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(–1/2) (cosθ)^(1/2) [1 – sinθ cosθ]^(–2) dθ.

Step 2. Express the answer in terms of Gamma functions

After some further (non–elementary) changes of variable and using the standard representation of the hypergeometric function (which in turn can be summed in closed–form) one may show that

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁴)/(8√(2π)).
(One may show, for instance, that the answer can be written in the form
  I = B(1/4, 3/4) · {}₂F₁(2, 1/4; 1; 1/2),
and then use the classical evaluation
  B(1/4, 3/4) = Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4) = π√2
plus a known evaluation of the hypergeometric function.)

–––––––––––
Step 3. A numerical evaluation

Using that
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one computes
  Γ(1/4)⁴ ≈ (3.625609908)⁴ ≈ 172.168,
and
  8√(2π) ≈ 8 × 2.506628275 ≈ 20.053.
Thus numerically
  I ≈ 172.168/20.053 ≈ 8.5839999999.
Rounding to 10 decimal places we have
  I ≈ 8.5840000000.
