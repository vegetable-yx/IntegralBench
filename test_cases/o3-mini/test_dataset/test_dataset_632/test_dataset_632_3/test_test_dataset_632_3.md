We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) ⎣1/x⎦ · ⎡1/x⎤ · ln(1 – 1/⎣1/x⎦²) dx.

Note that for x in (0, 1/2] we have 1/x ≥ 2. For any integer n ≥ 2, on the interval

  x ∈ (1/(n + 1), 1/n],

we have ⎣1/x⎦ = n.

For x in this open interval (ignoring the endpoints which do not affect the value of the definite integral) the number 1/x lies in (n, n + 1) so that

  ⎡1/x⎤ = n + 1.

Thus, on the interval x ∈ (1/(n + 1), 1/n), the integrand is constant and equal to

  n (n + 1) · ln(1 – 1/n²).

Hence the integral can be written as a sum:

  I = ∑ₙ₌₂^∞ ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) n (n + 1) ln(1 – 1/n²) dx.

The length of the interval is

  Δxₙ = 1/n – 1/(n + 1).

Thus,

  I = ∑ₙ₌₂^∞ n (n + 1) · ln(1 – 1/n²) · (1/n – 1/(n + 1)).

Notice that

  n(n+1) · (1/n – 1/(n+1)) = n(n+1) · ((n+1 – n)/(n(n+1))) = 1.

Therefore the expression simplifies to

  I = ∑ₙ₌₂^∞ ln(1 – 1/n²).

Next, observe that

  1 – 1/n² = (n² – 1)/n² = [(n – 1)(n + 1)]/n²
  ⇒ ln(1 – 1/n²) = ln(n – 1) + ln(n + 1) – 2 ln n.

Thus, the series becomes

  I = ∑ₙ₌₂^∞ [ln(n – 1) + ln(n + 1) – 2 ln n].

To telescope the sum, write the partial sum S_N for n = 2 to N:

  S_N = ∑ₙ₌₂^N [ln(n – 1) + ln(n + 1) – 2 ln n].

Shift the indices:
  ∑ₙ₌₂^N ln(n – 1) = ∑ₘ₌₁^(N–1) ln m,
  ∑ₙ₌₂^N ln(n + 1) = ∑ₖ₌₃^(N+1) ln k,
  and 2∑ₙ₌₂^N ln n.
Thus,
  S_N = [ln 1 + ln 2 + … + ln (N–1)] + [ln 3 + ln 4 + … + ln (N+1)] – 2 [ln 2 + ln 3 + … + ln N].

Collecting like terms:
• ln 1 appears once.
• ln 2 appears in the first sum (coefficient +1) and in the negative sum (coefficient –2): overall coefficient –1.
• For ln k with 3 ≤ k ≤ N–1: they appear once in each of the first two sums and twice with negative sign; the total coefficient is 0.
• ln N appears once (from the second sum) and with coefficient –2 from negative sum: overall coefficient –1.
• ln(N+1) appears once from the second sum.
Thus,

  S_N = ln1 – ln2 – ln N + ln(N+1).

Since ln 1 = 0, we have

  S_N = ln((N+1)/(2N)).

Taking the limit as N → ∞ yields

  I = limₙ→∞ S_N = ln(limₙ→∞ (N+1)/(2N)) = ln(1/2) = –ln2.

Finally, the numerical approximation is

  –ln2 ≈ –0.6931471806.
