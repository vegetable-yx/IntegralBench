We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(1/2) ⎣1/x⎦ ⎡1/x⎤ ln(1 – 1/⎣1/x⎦²) dx.

Since the integrand involves the floor and ceiling functions of 1/x, we break the integration interval into pieces where these functions are constant. For n an integer, note that if

  x ∈ (1/(n+1), 1/n],

then
  ⎣1/x⎦ = n  and  ⎡1/x⎤ = n+1   [except on a set of measure zero where 1/x is an integer].

Since the integration interval is (0, 1/2] the values of n run from 2 to ∞ (because when x = 1/2, 1/x = 2 giving n = 2).

Thus we write

  I = Σₙ₌₂^(∞) ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) n(n+1) ln(1 – 1/n²) dx.

On the interval x ∈ (1/(n+1), 1/n], the integrand is constant in terms of n, so we can pull out n(n+1) ln(1 – 1/n²):

  I = Σₙ₌₂^(∞) n(n+1) ln(1 – 1/n²) ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) dx.

But

  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) dx = 1/n – 1/(n+1).

A simple computation shows that

  1/n – 1/(n+1) = (n+1 – n) / [n(n+1)] = 1/(n(n+1)).

Thus the factors n(n+1) cancel and we obtain

  I = Σₙ₌₂^(∞) ln(1 – 1/n²).

To simplify the infinite sum we make use of properties of logarithms and infinite products. Namely,

  Σₙ₌₂^(∞) ln(1 – 1/n²) = ln( ∏ₙ₌₂^(∞) (1 – 1/n²) ).

Let’s compute the product P:

  P = ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) (1 – 1/n²) = ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) [(n² – 1)/n²] = ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) [(n – 1)(n + 1)/n²].

Write the product as

  P = [∏ₙ₌₂^(N) (n–1)] [∏ₙ₌₂^(N) (n+1)] / [∏ₙ₌₂^(N) n²].

Notice that

  ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) (n–1) = (N–1)!,
  ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) (n+1) = ∏_{m=3}^{N+1} m = (N+1)!/2,
  ∏ₙ₌₂^(N) n² = (N!)².

Thus

  P = [(N–1)! * ((N+1)!/2)]/(N!)².

Express (N+1)! = (N+1) · N! so that

  P = [(N–1)! * (N+1) N!/(2)]/(N!)² = (N+1)/(2) · [(N–1)!/N!].

But (N–1)!/N! = 1/N, hence

  P = (N+1)/(2N).

Taking the limit as N → ∞ we get

  lim (N→∞) P = 1/2.

Therefore,

  I = ln(∏ₙ₌₂^(∞) (1 – 1/n²)) = ln(1/2) = – ln 2.

A numerical approximation gives

  – ln 2 ≈ –0.6931471806.

Thus, the final answer is:
