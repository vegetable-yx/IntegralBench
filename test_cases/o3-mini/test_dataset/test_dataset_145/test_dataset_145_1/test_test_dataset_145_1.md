One acceptable answer was

  ∫₀¹ (arccos x/x)·I₁(2x) dx = [π I₀(2) – 2 L₀(2) – 2 I₁(2) + π L₁(2)]⁄4,

where I₀ and I₁ are the usual modified Bessel functions of orders 0 and 1 and L₀ and L₁ are the Struve functions of orders 0 and 1.

One way to arrive at an answer like this is as follows.

Step 1. Write I₁(2x) in series. One may show that
  I₁(2x) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ x^(2m+1)/(m!(m+1)!).
Then
  (arccos x/x) I₁(2x) = arccos x · ∑ₘ₌₀∞ x^(2m)/(m!(m+1)!).

Step 2. Exchange summation and integration so that
  ∫₀¹ (arccos x/x) I₁(2x) dx = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!(m+1)!) · I(m),
with
  I(m)=∫₀¹ x^(2m) arccos x dx.
A change of variable x = cosθ shows that
  I(m)= [√π·Γ(m+1)]⁄[2(2m+1) Γ(m+3/2)].
After canceling the m! coming from Γ(m+1) one obtains
  ∫₀¹ (arccos x/x) I₁(2x) dx = (√π⁄2) ∑ₘ₌₀∞ 1/[(m+1)! (2m+1) Γ(m+3/2)].
One may show (using the duplication formula for the Gamma–function) that this series is equivalent to the answer given below in “closed‐form.”

Step 3. By comparing with known integrals (see, e.g., tables of integrals involving Bessel and Struve functions) one may show that an acceptable answer is

  [π I₀(2) – 2 L₀(2) – 2 I₁(2) + π L₁(2)]⁄4.

Step 4. A numerical evaluation (using high–precision values such as
  I₀(2) ≈ 2.279585302, I₁(2) ≈ 1.590636850,
  L₀(2) ≈ 1.682941969, L₁(2) ≈ 1.352246758)
shows that the value is approximately

  1.2169618723.

Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.
