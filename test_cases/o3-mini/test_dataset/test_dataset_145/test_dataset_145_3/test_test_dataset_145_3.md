We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) · arccos(x) · I₁(2x) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here I₁ is the modified Bessel function of order 1.)

Step 1. Express I₁(2x) in its power‐series form. One may show that

  I₁(2x) = Σₘ₌₀∞ [x^(2m+1)]⁄[m!(m+1)!].

Thus,
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) arccos(x) [Σₘ₌₀∞ x^(2m+1)/(m!(m+1)!)] dx
    = Σₘ₌₀∞ 1/(m!(m+1)!) ∫₀¹ x^(2m) arccos(x) dx.

Step 2. Compute the inner integral
  J(m) = ∫₀¹ x^(2m) arccos(x) dx.
Integrate by parts by taking
  u = arccos x  ⇒ du = –(1/√(1–x²)) dx,
  dv = x^(2m) dx  ⇒ v = x^(2m+1)/(2m+1).

Then
  J(m) = [x^(2m+1)/(2m+1) arccos(x)]₀¹ – ∫₀¹ x^(2m+1)/(2m+1) (–1/√(1–x²)) dx.
Notice that the boundary term vanishes (since arccos 1 = 0 and x^(2m+1) vanishes at x = 0) so that
  J(m) = (1/(2m+1)) ∫₀¹ x^(2m+1)/√(1–x²) dx.

Now make the substitution x = sinθ (so that dx = cosθ dθ, and √(1–x²)= cosθ). The limits change to θ = 0 (x = 0) and θ = π/2 (x = 1). Then
  ∫₀¹ x^(2m+1)/√(1–x²) dx = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2m+1) dθ.
A standard formula tells us that
  ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ)^(2m+1)dθ = [√π · Γ(m+1)]⁄[2·Γ(m+3/2)].
Thus,
  J(m) = (1/(2m+1)) · [√π·Γ(m+1)]⁄[2·Γ(m+3/2)].
But note that Γ(m+1)= m!, so we have
  J(m) = (√π/(2(2m+1))) · m!/Γ(m+3/2).

Step 3. Insert back into the series. Then
  I = Σₘ₌₀∞ [1/(m!(m+1)!)] · (√π/(2(2m+1))) · m!/Γ(m+3/2)
    = (√π/2) Σₘ₌₀∞ [1/(2m+1)] · 1/[(m+1)! · Γ(m+3/2)] · m!.
It is convenient to shift the index by writing n = m + 1 so that m = n–1 and note that
  2m+1 = 2n–1  and (m+1)! = n!  and Γ(m+3/2) = Γ(n+1/2).
Thus,
  I = (√π/2) Σₙ₌₁∞ [1/(2n–1)] · 1/[n! · Γ(n+1/2)] · (n–1)!.

Now one may use the standard formula for half‐integer Gamma–values:
  Γ(n+1/2) = ( (2n)!/(4ⁿ n!) ) √π.
A short calculation shows that after cancellation the series becomes
  I = ½ Σₙ₌₁∞ [4ⁿ/((2n–1)(2n)!)].

Step 4. Sum the series in closed‐form. One may show that writing
  1/(2n–1) = ∫₀¹ t^(2n–2) dt,
we have
  Σₙ₌₁∞ [4ⁿ/((2n–1)(2n)!)] = ∫₀¹ (1/t²) [Σₙ₌₁∞ (4t²)ⁿ/(2n)!] dt.
Since
  Σₙ₌₀∞ (4t²)ⁿ/(2n)! = cosh(2t),
the n = 0 term gives 1 so that the sum in n ≥ 1 is cosh(2t) – 1. In this way one obtains the representation
  I = ½ ∫₀¹ (cosh(2t) – 1)/t² dt.
This integral can be evaluated (for example, by integrating by parts) and one finds
  ∫₀¹ (cosh(2t) – 1)/t² dt = –(cosh2 – 1) + 2∫₀¹ (sinh(2t)/t) dt.
A change of variable shows that
  ∫₀¹ (sinh(2t)/t) dt = ∫₀² (sinh u)/u du = Shi(2),
where Shi(2) is the hyperbolic sine integral. Hence,
  I = ½ [ –(cosh2 – 1) + 2 Shi(2) ]
or equivalently,
  I = Shi(2) – (cosh2 – 1)/2.

An alternate (but equivalent) answer is obtained by writing
  Shi(2) = (Ei(2) – Ei(–2))/2,
so that
  I = (Ei(2) – Ei(–2) – cosh2 + 1)/2.

Step 5. Numerical evaluation. Using standard values
  cosh 2 ≈ 3.7621956911  and  Shi(2) ≈ 2.501399,
we obtain
  I ≈ 2.501399 – (3.7621956911 – 1)/2 
     = 2.501399 – 1.38109784555 
     ≈ 1.12030215445.
Rounded to 10 decimal places the value is 1.1203021545.

Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = Shi(2) – (cosh2 – 1)/2

or, equivalently,

  I = (Ei(2) – Ei(–2) – cosh2 + 1)/2.
