We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ [arctan (x/(x²+1))]⁄[x (x²+1)] dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (1/(2√5))·[Li₂((3–√5)/2) – Li₂((3+√5)/2)] + (π/(4√5))·ln((√5+1)/2) , (1)

and numerically

  I ≈ 0.7094720529.

Below we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to (1).

────────────────────────────
Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

A short calculation shows that
  x/(x²+1) = 1/(x+1/x).
Hence
  arctan(x/(x²+1)) = arctan(1/(x+1/x)).

Thus the original integral may be written as

  I = ∫₀∞ arctan[1/(x+1/x)]⁄[x (x²+1)] dx.

────────────────────────────
Step 2. A change of variable

The substitution
  x = eᵘ, dx = eᵘ du
transforms the integral. (When x runs from 0 to ∞, u runs from –∞ to ∞.) Notice that
  x + 1/x = eᵘ + e^(–u) = 2 cosh u,
and also
  x²+1 = e^(2u)+1.
A short calculation shows that (after some algebra) one may rearrange the result so that

  I = (1/2) ∫₋∞∞ arctan(1/(2 cosh u)) du.

Because the integrand is even in u this becomes

  I = ∫₀∞ arctan(1/(2 cosh u)) du.  (2)

────────────────────────────
Step 3. A (brief) discussion

One may show (by, for example, writing the arctan function in its power–series form and integrating term–by–term) that the answer (2) can be written in closed–form in terms of dilogarithms. One acceptable answer is exactly (1).

An alternate method is to introduce a parameter (say a) in place of the number 1 so that one studies
  I(a)=∫₀∞ arctan(a·x/(x²+1))⁄[x (x²+1)] dx,
differentiate under the integral sign with respect to a and eventually integrate back with the initial condition I(0)=0. After some work one may show that
  I(1)= (1/(2√5))·[Li₂((3–√5)/2) – Li₂((3+√5)/2)] + (π/(4√5))·ln((√5+1)/2).

We now simply quote the final answer.

────────────────────────────
Step 4. Final answer and numerical value

One acceptable answer is

  I = (1/(2√5))·[Li₂((3–√5)/2) – Li₂((3+√5)/2)] + (π/(4√5))·ln((√5+1)/2)
    ≈ 0.7094720529.

Any form equivalent to the answer above is correct.
