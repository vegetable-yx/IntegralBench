We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(x²+1))]·arctan[x/(x²+1)] dx

can be written in closed‐form. One way to “generate” the answer is to introduce a parameter so that

  I(a) = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(x²+1))] · arctan[a·x/(x²+1)] dx,  (1)

so that I = I(1) and I(0)=0. (Notice that when a = 0 the integrand is zero.) Differentiating under the integral sign with respect to the parameter a, we have

  d/da arctan[a·x/(x²+1)] = 1/(1+[a·x/(x²+1)]²) · (x/(x²+1)).

Thus,
  I′(a) = ∫₀∞ [1/(x(x²+1))] · [x/(x²+1)]/(1 + a²x²/(x²+1)²) dx.
The factors of x cancel so that
  I′(a) = ∫₀∞ 1/(x²+1)² · (x²+1)²/( (x²+1)² + a²x² ) dx
       = ∫₀∞ dx/((x²+1)² + a²x²).

But note that

  (x²+1)² + a²x² = x⁴ + 2x² + 1 + a²x² = x⁴ + (2+a²)x² + 1.
It turns out that the following standard formula holds for any constant q > −2:
  ∫₀∞ dx/(x⁴ + q·x² + 1) = π/(2√(2+q)).
In our case q = 2+a², so that
  I′(a) = π/(2√(4+a²)).  (2)

Now, integrating (2) with respect to a from 0 to 1,
  I = I(1) = ∫₀¹ I′(a) da = ∫₀¹ [π/(2√(4+a²))] da
      = (π/2) ∫₀¹ da/√(4+a²).

A standard antiderivative is
  ∫ da/√(4+a²) = ln|a + √(4+a²)| + C.
Thus,
  I = (π/2)[ln(1+√(5)) − ln(0+2)]
    = (π/2)·ln[(1+√5)/2].

A short calculation shows that the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.6180339888, so
  ln φ ≈ 0.4812118251  and  (π/2) ≈ 1.5707963268.
Their product is approximately 1.5707963268×0.4812118251 ≈ 0.7562522528.

Thus, the answer is

  I = (π/2) ln((1+√5)/2)  ≈ 0.7562522528.
