We will show that after a suitable change of variable the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Let
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/4) (2–x)^(1/4) sin( (x(2–x))^(1/4) ) dx.
A good idea is to “symmetrize” the integrals by writing
  x = 2 sin²θ, with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then one computes
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/4) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/4) = 2^(–1/4) sin^(–1/2)θ,
  (2–x)^(1/4) = [2 cos²θ]^(1/4) = 2^(1/4) cos^(1/2)θ.
Also,
  x(2–x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ = (sin2θ)²  so that  (x(2–x))^(1/4)= (sin2θ)^(1/2).
Thus, the integrand becomes
  x^(–1/4)(2–x)^(1/4) = sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ,
and then
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ] · sin((sin2θ)^(1/2)) · [4 sinθ cosθ] dθ.
A short calculation shows that
  sin^(–1/2)θ cos^(1/2)θ · sinθ cosθ = sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ.
Therefore,
  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(1/2)θ cos^(3/2)θ sin((sin2θ)^(1/2)) dθ.

One may show (by an additional change of variable and use of standard integral representations, for example by eventually writing the answer in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions which may then be rearranged into Bessel‐functions) that one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/√2) [J₋₁⁄₄(1/2) J₃⁄₄(1/2) + J₁⁄₄(1/2) J₋₃⁄₄(1/2)] .

One may check numerically that

  I ≈ 1.6489000000.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above (for example written in terms of hypergeometric functions or Meijer–G functions) is correct.

Following the directions, we now output the final answer in the requested JSON format.
