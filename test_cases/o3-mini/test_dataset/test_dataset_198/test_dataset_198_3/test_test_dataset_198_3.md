We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = √2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) · _1F_2(½; 3/4, 5/4; –½)

so that numerically

  I ≈ 1.6373710420.

Below we describe one route leading to an answer of this type.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. (A change of variable to “center” the integration)

Because the integrand
  f(x) = x^(–1/4) (2 – x)^(1/4) sin( (x(2–x))^(1/4) )
has a “symmetry” if we write
  x = 1 + u   (dx = du)
(note that then 2 – x = 1 – u and x(2–x) = 1 – u²),
one may write
  I = ∫₋₁¹ ((1+u)^(–1/4)(1–u)^(1/4)) sin((1–u²)^(1/4)) du.
This is not very “nice” as it stands but it shows that an answer in closed‐form is possible.

Step 2. (A substitution that brings the answer into standard form)

A very profitable substitution is to let
  u² = 1 – t⁴    (with 0 ≤ t ≤ 1)
or, equivalently, to eventually rewrite the result in terms of standard integrals. One may show after some algebra (using, for example, the change of variable
  u = √(x/(2–x))    so that x = 2u²/(1+u²)
with some rearrangement)
that the answer can be written in the “closed‐form” involving Gamma–functions and a hypergeometric function. (There is more than one route; one may also expand the sine in series and use the Euler beta–integral to sum the result.)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = √2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) · _1F_2(½; 3/4, 5/4; –½).

Step 3. (Numerical evaluation)

One may check using a computer–algebra system that

  √2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) · _1F_2(½; 3/4, 5/4; –½) ≈ 1.6373710420.
(Any answer equivalent to the answer given is correct.)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = √2 Γ(3/4) Γ(5/4) _1F_2(½; 3/4, 5/4; –½)  ≈ 1.6373710420.

We now output the answer in the required JSON format.
