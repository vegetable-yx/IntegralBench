We begin with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ √[3]{x} ⎣1/√[3]{x}⎦ dx.

Step 1. Change of variable

Let u = x^(1/3) so that x = u³ and dx = 3u² du. Note that √[3]{x} = u. Then the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ u ⎣1/u⎦ (3u² du) = 3∫₀¹ u³ ⎣1/u⎦ du.

Step 2. Splitting the Integral into Subintervals

Since the floor function is involved, we split the interval [0, 1] into parts where ⎣1/u⎦ is constant. For a positive integer n, we have

  ⎣1/u⎦ = n  if  n ≤ 1/u < n+1  ⟹  1/(n+1) < u ≤ 1/n.

Thus, the integral becomes a sum:

  I = 3∑ₙ₌₁∞ ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) (u³ n du)
     = 3∑ₙ₌₁∞ n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) u³ du
     = 3∑ₙ₌₁∞ n [u⁴/4] from u = 1/(n+1) to u = 1/n
     = (3/4) ∑ₙ₌₁∞ n (1/n⁴ – 1/(n+1)⁴).

Step 3. Simplifying the Series

Write the series as

  S = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/n³ – n/(n+1)⁴].

Notice that

  n/(n+1)⁴ = [(n+1) – 1]/(n+1)⁴ = 1/(n+1)³ – 1/(n+1)⁴.

Thus,
  S = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/n³ – (1/(n+1)³ – 1/(n+1)⁴)]
   = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/n³ – ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)³ + ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)⁴.

Changing index in the second and third sums (let m = n+1) gives:

  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)³ = ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m³ = ζ(3) – 1
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)⁴ = ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴ = ζ(4) – 1.

So we have

  S = ζ(3) – (ζ(3) – 1) + (ζ(4) – 1) = ζ(4).

Thus, the integral becomes

  I = (3/4) ζ(4).

Recall that ζ(4) = π⁴/90. Therefore,

  I = (3/4)(π⁴/90) = π⁴/120.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

We have

  π⁴ ≈ 97.40909103400244,
  I = 97.40909103400244 / 120 ≈ 0.8117424252833537.

Rounded to ten decimal places, I ≈ 0.8117424253.
