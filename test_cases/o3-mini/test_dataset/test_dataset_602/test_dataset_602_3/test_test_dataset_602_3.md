We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ √[3]{x} · ⎣1/√[3]{x}⎦ dx.

Step 1. Make the substitution
  t = √[3]{x} ⟹ x = t³ and dx = 3t² dt.
Notice that when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from 0 to 1. In terms of t, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ t · ⎣1/t⎦ · 3t² dt = 3 ∫₀¹ t³ ⎣1/t⎦ dt.

Step 2. The floor function ⎣1/t⎦ is constant on the intervals where
  1/(n+1) < t ≤ 1/n for n = 1, 2, 3, … 
because on these intervals, 1/t lies between n and n + 1. Hence, we can write

  I = 3 ∑ₙ₌₁∞ n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) t³ dt.

For a given n, we have

  Iₙ = 3n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) t³ dt = 3n · [t⁴/4] (evaluated between t = 1/(n+1) and t = 1/n)
    = (3n/4) [1/n⁴ − 1/(n+1)⁴].

Thus,
  I = (3/4) ∑ₙ₌₁∞ n (1/n⁴ − 1/(n+1)⁴)
     = (3/4) ∑ₙ₌₁∞ (1/n³ − n/(n+1)⁴).

Step 3. To simplify the summation, notice that we can rewrite the term n/(n+1)⁴ as follows:
  n/(n+1)⁴ = [(n + 1) − 1]/(n+1)⁴ = 1/(n+1)³ − 1/(n+1)⁴.

Then the summation becomes
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/n³ − (1/(n+1)³ − 1/(n+1)⁴)]
    = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ (1/n³ − 1/(n+1)³) + ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)⁴.

The first series telescopes:
  ∑ₙ₌₁ᴺ (1/n³ − 1/(n+1)³) = 1 − 1/(N+1)³ ⟶ 1 as N → ∞.

For the second series, substitute m = n + 1:
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/(n+1)⁴ = ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴ = ζ(4) − 1,
where ζ(4) is the Riemann zeta function at 4, and it is known that ζ(4) = π⁴/90.

Thus, the entire sum is
  1 + (ζ(4) − 1) = ζ(4) = π⁴/90.

Therefore, the original integral evaluates to
  I = (3/4) · (π⁴/90) = (3π⁴)/(360) = π⁴/120.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:
  π⁴ ≈ 97.409091034002437,
so
  I = π⁴/120 ≈ 97.40909103400244/120 ≈ 0.8117424253.

Thus, the final answer is:
