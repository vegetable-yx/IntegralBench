We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x^(1/3) ⎣1/(x^(1/3))⎦ dx.

Step 1. Substitution

Let u = x^(1/3) so that x = u³ and dx = 3u² du. When x goes from 0 to 1, u also goes from 0 to 1. Then

  I = ∫₀¹ u ⎣1/u⎦ (3u² du) = 3 ∫₀¹ u³ ⎣1/u⎦ du.

Step 2. Breaking the integral into pieces

The floor function ⎣1/u⎦ is constant on intervals where u lies in (1/(n+1), 1/n] for positive integers n (since 1/u ∈ [n, n+1) on this interval). Therefore, we write

  I = 3 ∑ₙ₌₁⁽∞⁾ ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) u³ n du = 3 ∑ₙ₌₁⁽∞⁾ n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) u³ du.

Step 3. Evaluate the integral over each interval

Compute the antiderivative of u³:

  ∫ u³ du = u⁴/4.

Hence, for each n,
  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) u³ du = [ (1/(n))⁴ - (1/(n+1))⁴ ]/4.

So the sum becomes

  I = 3/4 ∑ₙ₌₁⁽∞⁾ n [1/n⁴ – 1/(n+1)⁴]
    = 3/4 ∑ₙ₌₁⁽∞⁾ (1/n³ – n/(n+1)⁴).

Step 4. Simplify the sum

Write S as
  S = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ [1/n³ – n/(n+1)⁴].

Change the index in the second sum by letting m = n + 1:
  ∑ₙ₌₁∞ n/(n+1)⁴ = ∑ₘ₌₂∞ (m–1)/m⁴ = ∑ₘ₌₂∞ [1/m³ – 1/m⁴].

Thus,
  S = ∑ₙ₌₁∞ 1/n³ – [∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m³ – ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴]
    = 1 + ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m³ – ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m³ + ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴
    = 1 + ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴.

But note that
  ∑ₘ₌₂∞ 1/m⁴ = ζ(4) – 1,
where ζ(4) is the Riemann zeta function at 4. Hence,
  S = 1 + (ζ(4) – 1) = ζ(4).

Step 5. Final expression for I

Thus,
  I = 3/4 ζ(4).

Since ζ(4) = π⁴/90, we have
  I = (3/4)·(π⁴/90) = π⁴/120.

Step 6. Numerical approximation

Now, using π⁴ ≈ 97.40909103400243, we get
  I ≈ 97.40909103400243 / 120 ≈ 0.8117424252833536.
Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is 0.8117424253.
