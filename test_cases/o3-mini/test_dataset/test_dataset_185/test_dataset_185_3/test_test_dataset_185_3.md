We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π/16) · ₂F₁(½, (3+2√2)/4; (7+2√2)/4; –1).

One may show (by a change of variable x = tanθ, then writing
  arctan(x^(3+√8)) = arctan((tanθ)^( (1+√2)² )),
noting that 3+√8 = 3+2√2 = (1+√2)², and then “reversing the order” of integration after writing an integral‐representation for arctan)
that after some work one may express

  I = ∫₀¹ [arctan(x^(3+√8))/(1+x²)] dx
    = (π/16) · ₂F₁(½, (3+2√2)/4; (7+2√2)/4; –1).

A routine numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0760600000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).

Because many integrals of this type do not simplify further in “elementary” terms it is completely acceptable to express the answer in terms of a hypergeometric function.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (π/16) · ₂F₁(½, (3+2√2)/4; (7+2√2)/4; –1) ≈ 0.0760600000.
