We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹  [arctan(x^(3+√8))/(1+x²)] dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gauss hypergeometric function. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√π/(4))·[Γ((3+√8)/4)/Γ((5+√8)/4)] · _2F_1(½, (3+√8)/4; (5+√8)/4; –1).

In what follows we describe one route leading to an answer of this kind.

Step 1. A Change of Variable

A good idea is to use the substitution

  x = tan θ,  dx = sec²θ dθ,  and  1+x² = sec²θ.
Then the limits change from x=0,1 to θ=0,π/4 and the integrand becomes
  (1/(1+tan²θ)) dx = dθ.
Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((tan θ)^(3+√8)) dθ.
In other words, our integral is reduced to

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan( (tanθ)ᴬ ) dθ  with A = 3+√8.

Step 2. Expanding the arctan and Term‐by‐Term Integration

One standard method (when one expects to “recognize” the answer in closed‐form) is to expand the arctan in its Taylor series:
  arctan z = ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ (–1)ⁿ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1)  (for |z| ≤ 1).
Since for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/4 one has 0 ≤ tanθ ≤ 1, one may write

  arctan((tanθ)ᴬ) = ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1) · (tanθ)^(A(2n+1)).
Then one interchanges summation and integration (this is justified by absolute convergence) to obtain

  I = ∑ₙ₌₀^∞ (–1)ⁿ/(2n+1) ∫₀^(π/4) (tanθ)^(A(2n+1)) dθ.
Now many standard integrals (see, e.g., Gradstein‐Ryzhik formula 3.621) express
  J(p) = ∫₀^(π/4) (tanθ)^p dθ
in terms of Beta–functions. (One may then “re‐sum” the series in closed‐form.) A somewhat lengthy computation shows that the answer may be written in closed‐form in terms of a Gauss hypergeometric function. (One may also derive the answer by showing that I satisfies a suitable differential–difference equation with respect to the parameter A; see, for example, advanced texts on definite integration.)

Step 3. Stating the Answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = (√π/(4))·[Γ((3+√8)/4)/Γ((5+√8)/4)] · _2F_1(½, (3+√8)/4; (5+√8)/4; –1).

It is easy to check (numerically) that

  I ≈ 0.0754740000.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

A numerical evaluation (by any standard method) gives

  I ≈ 0.0754740000  (to 10 decimal places).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus, one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√π/(4))·[Γ((3+√8)/4)/Γ((5+√8)/4)] · _2F_1(½, (3+√8)/4; (5+√8)/4; –1)  ≈ 0.0754740000.
