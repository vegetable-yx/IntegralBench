One acceptable answer was to show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and a Gaussian hypergeometric function. For example, one acceptable answer was

   I = ∫₀¹ [arctan(x^(3+√8))/(1+x²)] dx 
    = (π²/16) – [(3+√8)/(8)]·[Γ((3+√8)/4)²/Γ((5+√8)/4)²] · {}₂F₁(½, (3+√8)/4; (5+√8)/4; –1).

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.0763711032.

Below is the final answer in the required JSON format.
