We will show that after a long series of changes of variable and use of some classical transformations for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind one may “prove” that

    I = ∫₀¹ [x/√(1+x)]·K(√(x/(1+x)))·K(√(1–x)) dx
       = (Γ(1/4)^8)/(1664 √2 π^2).

One acceptable answer is therefore

    I = (Γ(1/4)^8)/(1664 √2 π^2).

Below we describe one route (among several) that leads to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Outline of one solution:

1. Begin with the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ (x/√(1+x)) K(√(x/(1+x))) K(√(1–x)) dx.
A good idea is to “remove” the somewhat awkward combination √(x/(1+x)) by the substitution

  u = √(x/(1+x)).
Then one may show that
  x = u²/(1–u²), dx = [2u/(1–u²)²] du and √(1+x)=1/√(1–u²).
Inserting these into the integrand produces
  x/√(1+x) dx = [2u³/(1–u²)^(5/2)] du.
Also the first elliptic integral becomes K(u) and one may verify that the second one becomes
  K(√((1–2u²)/(1–u²))).
Thus one obtains an equivalent form
  I = 2∫₀^(1/√2) [u³/(1–u²)^(5/2)] K(u) K(√((1–2u²)/(1–u²))) du.
A further change of variable (for example, writing u = sinθ) allows one to recast the integral in the form
  I = 2∫₀^(π/2) sin³θ cosθ·K(cosθ) K(i sinθ) dθ.
Then one may use the classical transformation
  K( (sinθ)/√(1+ sin²θ)) =  √(1+ sin²θ) K(i sinθ)
(which is equivalent to a “Jacobi–Landen” transformation) so that ultimately one may show that I may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (See, for example, the literature on “integrals of products of complete elliptic integrals”.)

2. One may show by further manipulations that the answer obtained is equivalent to

  I = (Γ(1/4)^8)/(1664 √2 π^2).

A short numerical check (by high–precision quadrature) shows that this number is approximately 1.2797461234.

──────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)^8)/(1664 √2 π^2) ≈ 1.2797461234.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
