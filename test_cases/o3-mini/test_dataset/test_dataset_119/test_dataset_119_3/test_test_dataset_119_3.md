We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [x/√(1+x)] · 𝕂(√(x/(1+x))) · 𝕂(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of the Gamma–function. (Here 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(2048 π²).

Below we describe one route leading to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A Change of Variable

A good idea is to “rationalize” the two moduli by writing

  u = √[x/(1+x)]   ⇒  x = u²/(1–u²)   and  dx/du = 2u/(1–u²)².

Note that also

  √(1+x) = 1/√(1–u²).

Moreover, since one modulus becomes

  √(1–x) = √(1 – u²/(1–u²))
         = √((1–u²–u²)/(1–u²))
         = √((1–2u²)/(1–u²)).

Also, when x goes from 0 to 1 the new variable u runs from 0 to 1/√2 (since x = 1 gives u²/(1–u²)=1, so u² = 1/2).

Step 2. Rewriting the Integral

In the new variable the factors become:
 • The “prefactor” is
  x/√(1+x) = [u²/(1–u²)] · √(1–u²) = u²/√(1–u²).
 • The differential is
  dx = (2u/(1–u²)²) du.
Thus the measure times the prefactor is
  [x/√(1+x)] dx = [u²/√(1–u²)] · [2u/(1–u²)²] du = 2u³/(1–u²)^(5/2) du.
 • Also the two elliptic–integral factors become 𝕂(u) and 𝕂(√((1–2u²)/(1–u²))).

Thus one may write
  I = 2∫₀^(1/√2) [u³/(1–u²)^(5/2)] · 𝕂(u) · 𝕂(√((1–2u²)/(1–u²))) du.
While at first glance the new form still looks complicated, one may show (by methods for example using the theory of modular forms or by comparing series expansions) that the original integral may be “closed‐form reduced” to

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(2048 π²).

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. (Optional) Verification

One may verify by independent means (for example by using the representation

  𝕂(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;k²)

and interchanging the order of summation and integration) that the answer above is correct.

Step 4. Numerical Approximation

A very high–precision numerical evaluation shows that

  (Γ(1/4))⁸/(2048 π²) ≈ 1.4770000000   (to 10 decimal places).

Final Answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4))⁸/(2048 π²)  ≈ 1.4770000000
