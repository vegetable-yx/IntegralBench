We wish to compute

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((1 + tan x) / √2) dx.

A very neat idea is to transform the variable in a way that produces a sum of two integrals whose sum is constant. We proceed as follows.

Step 1. Write the integrand in an equivalent form.

Notice that
  tan x = sin x / cos x.
Thus,
  1 + tan x = (cos x + sin x) / cos x.
Inserting this into the argument of the arctan we obtain
  (1 + tan x)/√2 = (cos x + sin x)/(√2 cos x).
But recall that
  sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4).
Thus we can write
  (1 + tan x)/√2 = [√2 sin(x + π/4)]/(√2 cos x) = sin(x + π/4)/cos x.
Therefore our integrand becomes
  arctan(sin(x + π/4)/cos x).

Step 2. A symmetry trick.

The idea now is to make a substitution that “flips” the integration interval. Let

  u = π/4 − x.
Then when x = 0, u = π/4, and when x = π/4, u = 0.
Changing the variable (and then renaming u back to x) we have
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((1 + tan(π/4 − x))/√2) dx.
But we know that
  tan(π/4 − x) = (1 − tan x)/(1 + tan x).
Thus,
  1 + tan(π/4 − x) = 1 + (1 − tan x)/(1 + tan x) = ( (1 + tan x) + (1 − tan x))/(1 + tan x) = (2/(1 + tan x) ).
Hence,
  (1 + tan(π/4 − x))/√2 = 2/(√2 (1 + tan x)) = √2/(1 + tan x).
Thus the transformed integral is
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan(√2/(1 + tan x)) dx.

So now we have two expressions for I:
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan((1 + tan x)/√2) dx        (1)
and
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) arctan(√2/(1 + tan x)) dx        (2).

Step 3. Add the two forms.

Add (1) and (2) to obtain
  2I = ∫₀^(π/4) [ arctan((1 + tan x)/√2) + arctan(√2/(1 + tan x)) ] dx.

Now, recall the identity: for any a > 0,
  arctan(a) + arctan(1/a) = π/2.
Here, a = (1 + tan x)/√2, which is indeed positive on [0, π/4]. Thus the sum inside the integrand becomes π/2 for every x in [0, π/4]. Hence,
  2I = ∫₀^(π/4) (π/2) dx = (π/2)·(π/4) = π²/8.
Therefore,
  I = π²/16.

Step 4. Numerical approximation.

We now compute a numerical approximation:
  π² ≈ (3.1415926536)² ≈ 9.8696044011,
so
  I = 9.8696044011/16 ≈ 0.6168502751.

Thus, the exact value is π²/16 and the numerical value (rounded to 10 decimal places) is 0.6168502751.
