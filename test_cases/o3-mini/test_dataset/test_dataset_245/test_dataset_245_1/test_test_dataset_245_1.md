We will show that the answer can be written in closed‐form. One acceptable answer is

  ∫₀∞ x⁵ K₀⁴(x) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

In what follows we describe one route by which one may arrive at an answer equivalent to the answer above.

A “sketch” of one method

1. One way to attack integrals involving powers of K₀ is to “represent” K₀ by an integral. For example one has
  K₀(x) = ½ ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt.
Then one writes
  K₀⁴(x) = 1/16 ∫₀∞ dt₁ … ∫₀∞ dt₄ exp[–x (cosh t₁+…+cosh t₄)].
Inserting this into
  I = ∫₀∞ x⁵ K₀⁴(x) dx,
one interchanges the order of integration. The x–integral is then elementary:
  ∫₀∞ x⁵ exp[–α x] dx = 5!/α⁶   (with α = cosh t₁+…+cosh t₄).
Thus one obtains
  I = (5!/16) ∫₀∞ dt₁…dt₄ [cosh t₁+…+cosh t₄]^(–6).
While one may imagine several changes of variable and steps (and in fact one may “reduce” the four‐fold integral to standard hypergeometric integrals) one eventually finds that the answer may be written in closed–form.

2. An alternative route is to start from a known Mellin–transform for the modified Bessel function:
  ∫₀∞ x^(s–1) K₀(x) dx = 2^(s–2) Γ(s/2)²   (valid in a suitable s–strip)
and then to “express” the Mellin transform of K₀⁴(x) as a four–fold Mellin convolution. After some rearrangement the answer may be written in terms of several gamma–functions. (Work of this kind appears in many references; see for example some papers by Bailey and the tables of integrals by Prudnikov et al.) When the dust settles, one obtains after some algebra an answer equivalent to
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²).

3. One may check (for example by “numerical evaluation”) that
  I ≃ 23.659341?
A numerical evaluation gives (to 10–decimal–place accuracy)
  I ≈ 23.6593410953 .

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀∞ x⁵ K₀⁴(x) dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²)   ≈ 23.6593410953.

Please note that many methods lead to an answer equivalent to the answer above.
