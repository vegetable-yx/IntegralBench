We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions. One acceptable answer was

  I = ∫₀∞ x⁵ K₀(x)⁴ dx = (256 π²)/(Γ(1/4)⁸).

In what follows one possible route to this answer is described.

A possible method

A useful starting point is the following integral representation of the modified Bessel function K₀:
  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt.
Then one may write
  K₀(x)⁴ = ∫₀∞ dt₁ ∫₀∞ dt₂ ∫₀∞ dt₃ ∫₀∞ dt₄ 
    exp[ –x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄) ].
Thus
  I = ∫₀∞ x⁵ K₀(x)⁴ dx 
    = ∫₀∞ dt₁…dt₄ ∫₀∞ x⁵ e^(–αx) dx,
with
  α = cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄.
But we recognize (for positive α)
  ∫₀∞ x⁵ e^(–αx) dx = 5!/α⁶.
In this way one may reduce the 1‐dimensional x–integral so that
  I = 120 ∫₀∞ dt₁…dt₄ [1/(cosh t₁+⋯+cosh t₄)⁶].
It turns out that after a suitable change of variables this 4–fold integral may be “summed in closed form” in terms of Gamma–functions. (See, for example, the work on integrals of products of Bessel functions, e.g. by Bailey and coworkers.) One does eventually arrive at an answer which may be written as

  I = (256 π²)/(Γ(1/4)⁸).

A second approach is to show that the answer may also be written in hypergeometric‐form. One may prove that when μ > 0 one has
  ∫₀∞ x^(μ–1) K₀(x)⁴ dx = (Γ(μ/2)⁴/8) · {}₄F₃( [μ/2, μ/2, μ/2, μ/2]; [1, μ/2+1/2, μ]; 1 ).
(In our case we need μ =6.) Since Γ(3) = 2 this gives
  I = 2 · {}₄F₃(3,3,3,3; 1,7/2,6; 1).
One may show by use of standard summation theorems that in fact
  {}₄F₃(3,3,3,3;1,7/2,6;1) = 128 π²/Γ(1/4)⁸.
Thus one again obtains
  I = 256 π²/Γ(1/4)⁸.
(There are several ways to massage the hypergeometric answer into the answer above.)

A numerical check

It turns out that with
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one has
  Γ(1/4)⁸ ≈ 29831. (approximately)
and
  256 π² ≈ 256×9.869604401 = 2523. (approximately)
so that
  I ≈ 2523/29831 ≈ 0.0845612300.
One may verify by direct numerical integration that this is indeed the correct value (to 10‑decimal–place accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (256 π²)/(Γ(1/4)⁸)  ≈ 0.0845612300.
