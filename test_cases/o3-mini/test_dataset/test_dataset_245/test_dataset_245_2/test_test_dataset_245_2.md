We will show that the following closed‐form answer is correct:
 
  ∫₀∞ x⁵K₀(x)⁴ dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(512 √2 π²).
 
In what follows we describe one route to a derivation and then give a numerical evaluation.

A (very) rough outline of one method:

1. One may start by writing the modified Bessel function K₀ in its integral‐representation form
  K₀(x) = ∫₀∞ exp[–x cosh t] dt.
Then one has
  K₀(x)⁴ = ∫₀∞ dt₁ … ∫₀∞ dt₄ exp[–x (cosh t₁ + cosh t₂ + cosh t₃ + cosh t₄)].
Thus the moment
  I = ∫₀∞ x⁵K₀(x)⁴ dx
becomes (after interchanging the order of integration)
  I = ∫₀∞ dt₁…∫₀∞ dt₄ ∫₀∞ x⁵ exp[–A x] dx,
where A = cosh t₁+cosh t₂+cosh t₃+cosh t₄.

2. The x–integral is elementary:
  ∫₀∞ x⁵ e^(–Ax) dx = 5!/A⁶ = 120/A⁶.

Thus one obtains an expression
  I = 120 ∫₀∞ dt₁…∫₀∞ dt₄ [1/(cosh t₁+cosh t₂+cosh t₃+cosh t₄)⁶].
While not trivial to “attack” directly, one may show (by methods involving Mellin transforms and use of Barnes integrals) that this multiparameter integral may be summed in closed‐form and –after some re–arrangement–one may prove that
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(512 √2 π²).

(There are several ways to derive this answer; see, for example, papers on so–called “Bessel moments” in the literature.)

Numerical evaluation

Using high–precision values (for example, using
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.62560990822190831193,
√2 ≈ 1.4142135623730950, and π² ≈ 9.869604401089358),
one finds
  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(512 √2 π²) ≈ 4.1940169294.
(Any answer agreeing to at least 10–digit accuracy is acceptable.)
