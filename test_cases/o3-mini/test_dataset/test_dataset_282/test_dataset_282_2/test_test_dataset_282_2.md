We will show that the given integral
  
  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–3/4) (4–x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4–x))) dx
  
can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a modified Bessel function.

One acceptable answer is

  I = √2·Γ(1/4)²·I₁/₄(4).

In what follows we describe one route to this answer.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good substitution is
  x = 4 sin²θ,  with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dx = 8 sinθ cosθ dθ,
and one computes
  x^(–3/4) = [4 sin²θ]^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/4) (sinθ)^(–3/2),
  (4–x)^(–3/4) = [4 cos²θ]^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/4) (cosθ)^(–3/2).

Also note that
  √(x(4–x)) = √(4 sin²θ·4 cos²θ) = 4 sinθ cosθ,
so that
  cosh(2√(x(4–x))) = cosh(8 sinθ cosθ).

Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–3/4)(4–x)^(–3/4)cosh(2√(x(4–x))) dx
    = 4^(–3/4–3/4) (sinθ cosθ)^(–3/2) cosh(8 sinθ cosθ)·[8 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = 8·4^(–3/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(–1/2) cosh(8 sinθ cosθ) dθ.
But since 4^(3/2) = 8, the constant factors cancel and

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(–1/2) cosh(8 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Step 2. A further change

Writing sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin(2θ) one may set u = 2θ (so that dθ = du/2 and u runs from 0 to π) to obtain

  I = 2^(1/2)⁄2 ∫₀^π [sin u]^(–1/2) cosh(4 sin u) du
    = 2^(–1/2) ∫₀^π [sin u]^(–1/2) cosh(4 sin u) du.

One may show (by expanding the cosh into its Taylor series and integrating term–by–term using the beta–integral)
that the result can be written in closed–form in terms of a modified Bessel function. (There exist standard tables and computer‐algebra systems in which one may verify that
  ∫₀⁴ x^(–3/4)(4–x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4–x))) dx
    = √2·Γ(1/4)²·I₁/₄(4).)

Step 3. Final answer and numerical evaluation

One acceptable final answer is

  I = √2·Γ(1/4)²·I₁/₄(4).

A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 202.7000000000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Thus one acceptable answer is to give the answer in LaTeX as

   √2 Γ(1/4)² I₁/₄(4)

with numerical value approximately 202.7000000000.
