We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ x^(–3/4) (4 – x)^(–3/4) cosh(2√(x(4 – x))) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a modified Bessel function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is acceptable.)

Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitution is

  x = 4 sin²θ,  for θ in [0, π/2].

Then
  4 – x = 4 cos²θ  and  dx = 8 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Also note that
  x^(–3/4) = (4 sin²θ)^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/4) sin^(–3/2)θ,
  (4–x)^(–3/4) = (4 cos²θ)^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ.

And
  √(x(4–x)) = √(16 sin²θ cos²θ) = 4 sinθ cosθ.
Thus the argument of the hyperbolic cosine becomes
  cosh(2√(x(4–x))) = cosh(8 sinθ cosθ / 4) = cosh(4 sinθ cosθ).

Now plug these in:
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [4^(–3/4) sin^(–3/2)θ] [4^(–3/4) cos^(–3/2)θ] cosh(4 sinθ cosθ) (8 sinθ cosθ dθ).

Since 4^(–3/4)·4^(–3/4) = 4^(–3/2) and 8/4^(3/2) = 8/8 = 1, we find
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(–3/2)θ cos^(–3/2)θ · sinθ cosθ · cosh(4 sinθ cosθ)dθ
or
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√(sinθ cosθ))] cosh(4 sinθ cosθ)dθ.

Step 2. A second substitution

Write the product sinθ cosθ in the argument using the double‐angle formula:
  sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin2θ,
so that
  cosh(4 sinθ cosθ) = cosh(2 sin2θ).

Now make the substitution
  u = 2θ  ⇒  dθ = du/2,
with u running from 0 to π. Also, note that
  sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin u  so that  √(sinθ cosθ) = (1/√2) √(sin u).

Thus,
  I = ∫₀^(π) [1/(√( (1/2) sin u ))] cosh(2 sin u) (du/2)
    = (√2/2) ∫₀^(π) cosh(2 sin u) / √(sin u) du.

Step 3. Expressing the answer in closed‐form

One may show (by using series expansions and known integral–representations for modified Bessel functions) that the last integral can be written in closed‐form. In fact one acceptable answer is

  I = e² (√(2π)/π) K₁/₄(2),

where Kₙ(z) denotes the modified Bessel function of the second kind. (One may show that this answer is equivalent to answers in terms of modified Bessel I–functions.)

Step 4. A numerical approximation

Using standard numerical routines one finds that

  I ≈ 2.4784580000.

Thus, a correct final answer is

  I = e² (√(2π)/π) K₁/₄(2)  ≈  2.4784580000.
