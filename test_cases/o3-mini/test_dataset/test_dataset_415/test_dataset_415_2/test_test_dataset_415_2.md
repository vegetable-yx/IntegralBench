We want to evaluate
  I = ∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx,
where {x} denotes the fractional part of x. Since the fractional part function is periodic with period 1, we can split the integral into four intervals [0,1), [1,2), [2,3), and [3,4). In each interval, if we write x = k + t where k is an integer (k = 0, 1, 2, 3) and t = {x} ∈ [0, 1), then {x} = t. Thus,

  I = Σₖ₌₀³ ∫ₖ^(k+1) t⁴ dx = Σₖ₌₀³ ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt = 4 ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt.

Computing the integral:
  ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt = [t⁵/5]₀¹ = 1/5.

So, we have
  I = 4 × (1/5) = 4/5.

Numerically, 4/5 = 0.8, and to 10 decimal places this is 0.8000000000.
