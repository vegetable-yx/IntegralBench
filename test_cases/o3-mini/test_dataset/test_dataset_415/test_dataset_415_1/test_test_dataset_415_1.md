To compute the integral

  ∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx

we first note that the fractional part function {x} satisfies {x} = x - ⎣x⎦, and that on each interval [n, n+1) for an integer n, we have {x} = x - n.

Step 1. Split the integral into four intervals:
  ∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx = Σₙ₌₀³ ∫ₙⁿ⁺¹ {x}⁴ dx.

Step 2. On each interval [n, n+1), substitute t = x - n. Then dt = dx and when x goes from n to n+1, t goes from 0 to 1. Hence, {x} = t and the integral becomes:
  ∫ₙⁿ⁺¹ {x}⁴ dx = ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt.

Step 3. Evaluate the integral over [0, 1]:
  ∫₀¹ t⁴ dt = [t⁵/5]₀¹ = 1/5.

Step 4. Since there are four such intervals, the total value is:
  ∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx = 4 × (1/5) = 4/5.

Step 5. The numerical approximation of 4/5 is:
  4/5 = 0.8, which to 10 decimal places is 0.8000000000.
