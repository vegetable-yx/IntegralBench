To solve the integral

  I = ∫₀⁴ {x}⁴ dx,

we first recall that the fractional part function {x} = x − ⎣x⎦ is periodic with period 1. Consequently, the interval [0, 4] can be split into four subintervals [0, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), where on each interval, {x} = x - n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Thus, we can write
  I = Σₙ₌₀³ ∫ₙⁿ⁺¹ (x - n)⁴ dx.

By performing the substitution u = x - n (so that du = dx), the limits become u = 0 to u = 1. Therefore, on each interval we have
  ∫ₙⁿ⁺¹ (x - n)⁴ dx = ∫₀¹ u⁴ du.

Since this is the same for every integer n, we have
  I = 4 ∫₀¹ u⁴ du.

Now compute the integral
  ∫₀¹ u⁴ du = [u⁵/5]₀¹ = 1/5.

Thus, the exact answer is
  I = 4/5.

To provide a numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places,
  4/5 = 0.8 = 0.8000000000.
