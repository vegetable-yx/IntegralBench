We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(π/4) [tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)] / [tan(x) + sec²(x)] dx.

Step 1. Notice that if we denote
  D(x) = tan(x) + sec²(x),
then its derivative is
  D'(x) = sec²(x) + 2 sec²(x) tan(x)
     = sec²(x) (1 + 2 tan(x)).

Step 2. Write the numerator in terms of D(x) and D'(x):
 Numerator = tan(x) + 2 sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)
       = [sec²(x) + 2 tan(x) sec²(x)] + tan(x) + sec²(x)
       = D'(x) + D(x).

So the integrand becomes
  [D'(x) + D(x)] / D(x) = D'(x)/D(x) + 1.

Step 3. We can now split the integral:
  I = ∫₀^(π/4) [D'(x)/D(x) + 1] dx
   = ∫₀^(π/4) D'(x)/D(x) dx + ∫₀^(π/4) 1 dx.

The first integral is the derivative of ln|D(x)|, so that gives
  ∫₀^(π/4) D'(x)/D(x) dx = ln|D(x)| evaluated from x = 0 to x = π/4.

Step 4. Evaluate D(x) at the endpoints:
 At x = 0:
  tan(0) = 0, sec²(0) = 1, so D(0) = 0 + 1 = 1.
 At x = π/4:
  tan(π/4) = 1, sec²(π/4) = 2, so D(π/4) = 1 + 2 = 3.

Thus,
  ∫₀^(π/4) D'(x)/D(x) dx = ln(3) – ln(1) = ln 3.

The second integral is simply
  ∫₀^(π/4) dx = π/4.

Step 5. So the final solution is:
  I = ln 3 + π/4.

Step 6. Numerical approximation:
  π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634 and ln 3 ≈ 1.0986122887.
  Therefore, I ≈ 0.7853981634 + 1.0986122887 ≈ 1.8840104521.

The final answer is:
