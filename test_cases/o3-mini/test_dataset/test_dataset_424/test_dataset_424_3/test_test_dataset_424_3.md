We wish to evaluate
  I = ∫₋₂₀₂₃²⁰²₃ sin(x)/(x² + 1) dx.

Step 1. Notice that sin(x) is an odd function (i.e. sin(–x) = –sin(x)) and x² + 1 is an even function (i.e. (–x)² + 1 = x² + 1). Hence, the integrand
  f(x) = sin(x)/(x² + 1)
is odd because f(–x) = –f(x).

Step 2. When integrating an odd function over an interval symmetric with respect to the origin, we have:
  ∫₋ₐᵃ f(x) dx = 0.

Step 3. Since our integration limits are symmetric (–2023 and 2023), it follows directly that
  I = 0.

Step 4. Numerical approximation: 0 (rounded to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000).
