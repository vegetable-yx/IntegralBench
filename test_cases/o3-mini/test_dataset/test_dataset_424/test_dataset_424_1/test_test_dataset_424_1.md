We start with the integral

  I = ∫ from -2023 to 2023 [sin(x) / (x² + 1)] dx.

Step 1. Recognize that sin(x) is an odd function (sin(–x) = –sin x) and that 1/(x² + 1) is an even function (since 1/((–x)²+1) = 1/(x²+1)). Thus, the product sin(x)/(x²+1) is odd.

Step 2. For an odd function f(x), the integral from –a to a is zero, i.e.,
  ∫ from –a to a f(x) dx = 0.
Since our limits are symmetric (–2023 and 2023), the integral evaluates to 0.

Step 3. Therefore, the exact answer is 0 and, numerically, this is 0.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
