Step 1. Notice that the integrand is f(x) = sin(x)/(x² + 1). The sine function is odd (i.e. sin(–x) = –sin(x)) and the function 1/(x² + 1) is even. Thus, their product is odd:
  f(–x) = sin(–x)/(x² + 1) = –sin(x)/(x² + 1) = –f(x).

Step 2. Since f(x) is odd and the limits of integration, –2023 and 2023, are symmetric about 0, we know that
  ∫[–a to a] f(x) dx = 0.
Thus, the integral is exactly 0.

Step 3. The numerical approximation of 0 is simply 0.0000000000 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
