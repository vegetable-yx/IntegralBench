We start with

  I = ∫₀¹ (x³ + x + 1)/(3x² – 3x + 4) dx.

Step 1. Perform polynomial division of the numerator by the denominator. Since the numerator is degree 3 and the denominator is degree 2, we write

  x³ + x + 1 = Q(x)·(3x² – 3x + 4) + R(x).

First, divide x³ by 3x² to get (1/3)x. Multiply back:
  (1/3)x · (3x² – 3x + 4) = x³ – x² + (4/3)x.
Subtracting from x³ + x + 1 gives the intermediate remainder:
  (x³ + x + 1) – (x³ – x² + (4/3)x) = x² – (1/3)x + 1.

Now, divide x² by 3x² to obtain 1/3. Multiply back:
  (1/3) · (3x² – 3x + 4) = x² – x + 4/3.
Subtracting from the previous remainder:
  [x² – (1/3)x + 1] – [x² – x + 4/3] = (2x – 1)/3.

Thus, we have
  x³ + x + 1 = (1/3)(x + 1)·(3x² – 3x + 4) + (2x – 1)/3,
and the integrand becomes
  (x³ + x + 1)/(3x² – 3x + 4) = (1/3)(x + 1) + [ (2x – 1)/(3 (3x² – 3x + 4)) ].

Step 2. Write the original integral as the sum of two integrals:
  I = (1/3)∫₀¹ (x + 1) dx + (1/3)∫₀¹ (2x – 1)/(3x² – 3x + 4) dx.

For the first integral:
  ∫₀¹ (x + 1) dx = [½x² + x]₀¹ = ½ + 1 = 3/2,
and thus
  (1/3)·(3/2) = ½.

Step 3. Evaluate the second integral:
  J = (1/3)∫₀¹ (2x – 1)/(3x² – 3x + 4) dx.
Notice the derivative of the denominator is:
  d/dx (3x² – 3x + 4) = 6x – 3 = 3(2x – 1).
Let u = 3x² – 3x + 4 so that du = 3(2x – 1) dx, or (2x – 1) dx = du/3.
Changing the limits:
  When x = 0, u = 4, and when x = 1, u = 4.
Thus,
  J = (1/3)·(1/3)∫₄⁴ (du/u) = (1/9)∫₄⁴ (du/u) = 0,
since the limits coincide.

Step 4. Therefore, the value of the integral is:
  I = ½ + 0 = ½.

Step 5. The numerical approximation is 0.5, which to 10 decimal places is 0.5000000000.
