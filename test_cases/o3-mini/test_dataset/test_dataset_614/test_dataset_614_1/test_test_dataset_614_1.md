We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ (x³ + x + 1)/(3x² − 3x + 4) dx.

Step 1. Polynomial Division

Since the degree of the numerator is 3 and that of the denominator is 2, we first perform polynomial long division.

Divide: (x³ + 0·x² + x + 1) by (3x² − 3x + 4).

• First, x³ ÷ 3x² gives (1/3)x.
 Multiply (1/3)x by the denominator:
  (1/3)x · (3x² − 3x + 4) = x³ − x² + (4/3)x.
 Subtract this from the numerator:
  [x³ + 0·x² + x + 1] − [x³ − x² + (4/3)x] = x² + (x − (4/3)x) + 1 = x² − (1/3)x + 1.

• Next, divide the resulting x² by 3x² giving 1/3.
 Multiply (1/3) by the denominator:
  (1/3)(3x² − 3x + 4) = x² − x + 4/3.
 Subtract:
  [x² − (1/3)x + 1] − [x² − x + 4/3] = (−1/3x + 1) − (−x + 4/3) = (2/3)x − 1/3.

Thus, we have:
 x³ + x + 1 = (1/3)x + 1/3)·(3x² − 3x + 4) + [(2/3)x − 1/3].

So, the integrand can be written as:
 (x³ + x + 1)/(3x² − 3x + 4) = (1/3)(x + 1) + [ ( (2/3)x − 1/3 )/(3x² − 3x + 4) ].

Step 2. Split the Integral

Write I as:
 I = I₁ + I₂,
where
 I₁ = ∫₀¹ (1/3)(x + 1) dx,
 I₂ = ∫₀¹ [ ( (2/3)x − 1/3 )/(3x² − 3x + 4) ] dx.

Compute I₁:
 I₁ = (1/3) ∫₀¹ (x + 1) dx = (1/3)[(1/2)x² + x]₀¹
    = (1/3)[(1/2) + 1] = (1/3)(3/2) = 1/2.

Step 3. Evaluate I₂

First, factor out 1/3 in the numerator:
 I₂ = (1/3) ∫₀¹ (2x − 1)/(3x² − 3x + 4) dx.

Now, use the substitution:
 Let u = 3x² − 3x + 4. Then,
  du/dx = 6x − 3 = 3(2x − 1),
 or 2x − 1 = (1/3) du/dx.

Thus,
 I₂ = (1/3) ∫₀¹ [ (1/3)(du/dx) / u ] dx = (1/9) ∫₀¹ (du/dx)/u dx.
Notice that (du/dx) dx = du, so:
 I₂ = (1/9) ∫[u(0)]^[u(1)] (du/u)
    = (1/9)[ln|u|] evaluated from u(0) to u(1).

Now, compute the limits:
 At x = 0: u(0) = 3·0² − 3·0 + 4 = 4.
 At x = 1: u(1) = 3·1² − 3·1 + 4 = 3 − 3 + 4 = 4.

Thus,
 I₂ = (1/9)[ln(4) − ln(4)] = 0.

Step 4. Combine the Results

We have:
 I = I₁ + I₂ = 1/2 + 0 = 1/2.

Step 5. Numerical Approximation

1/2 numerically equals 0.5, and to 10 decimal places it is 0.5000000000.
