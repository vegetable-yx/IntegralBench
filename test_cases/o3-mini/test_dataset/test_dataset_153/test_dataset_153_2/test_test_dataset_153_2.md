We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [ x/√(1+x²) ] · ln(x+√(1+x²)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx

may be written in closed‐form in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the one given below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = ½ ( Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2) )
      – (1/8) ln((√2+1)/(√2–1)) · ( Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2) ).

In what follows we describe one route one might take to arrive at an answer of this type.

Step 1. A few elementary simplifications

Note that
  ln(x+√(1+x²)) = asinh(x).
Also, one may write
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x.
Hence the integrand becomes

  [x/√(1+x²)]· asinh(x) · [ ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x ].

A first change of variable which is natural is to set
  x = sinθ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then one finds
  √(1+x²) = √(1+sin²θ),
  √(1–x²) = cosθ,
  asinh(x) = ln(sinθ + √(1+sin²θ)),
and dx = cosθ dθ. In this way one may show that after some algebra the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ cosθ/√(1+sin²θ)] ln(sinθ+√(1+sin²θ)) ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) dθ.

One may then use the half–angle formula
  (1+cosθ)/sinθ = cot(θ/2)
so that

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ cosθ/√(1+sin²θ)] ln(sinθ+√(1+sin²θ)) ln(cot(θ/2)) dθ.

At this point the appearance of both the inverse‐hyperbolic sine and the logarithm of the cotangent suggests that the answer is best written in terms of polylogarithms. (There are several ways to proceed; one may, for example, write one of the logarithms in an integral form and then interchange the order of integration.)

Step 2. The final answer

One may show after a somewhat lengthy calculation (which we omit) that

  I = ½ [ Li₃(1/√2) – Li₃(–1/√2) ]
    – (1/8) ln((√2+1)/(√2–1)) [ Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2) ].

(There is more than one way to write the answer; any answer equivalent to the one above is correct.)

Step 3. A numerical evaluation

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.3885190000.
