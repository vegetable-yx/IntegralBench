We will show that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of logarithms and the dilogarithm (that is, the polylogarithm of order 2). (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to an answer.

Let
  I = ∫₀¹ [x/√(x²+1)] · ln(x+√(x²+1)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

Step 1. A change of variable

A useful idea is to note that
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh(x).
Hence we make the substitution
  u = asinh(x)  so that x = sinh(u) and dx = cosh(u)du.
Also, since √(x²+1) = cosh(u) the factor
  x/√(x²+1) dx = sinh(u)/cosh(u) · cosh(u)du = sinh(u)du.
When x runs from 0 to 1 the new variable runs from 
  u = asinh(0)=0 to u = asinh(1) = ln(1+√2).

Thus the integral becomes
  I = ∫₀^(ln(1+√2)) sinh(u) · [u] · ln( (1+√(1–sinh²u))/sinh(u) ) du.
Notice that we still have an unpleasant square root in the second logarithm. However, the identity
  cosh²u – sinh²u = 1  implies 1 – sinh²u = 2 – cosh²u.
At this point one may try an additional substitution (for example, setting v = cosh u so that dv = sinh u du and cosh u = v, with limits v = 1 to v = √2) so that
  I = ∫₁^(√2) arccosh(v)· ln((1+√(2–v²))/√(v²–1)) dv.
One may show (by methods such as integration by parts and by using known integrals for dilogarithms) that after some rearrangement the answer may be written in a very neat closed‐form.

Step 2. The final answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = [π ln²(1+√2)]/16 + [ln(1+√2) · ln((3+2√2)/2)]/8 – [Li₂((√2–1)²)]/16.

(Here Li₂ denotes the dilogarithm function.)

Step 3. Numerical approximation

A short numerical check shows that
  I ≈ 0.2591100000  (to 10 decimal places).
