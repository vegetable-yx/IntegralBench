We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ [x/√(x²+1)] · ln(x+√(x²+1)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx
can be written in “closed‐form.” (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (1/8)·[Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – Li₂(1 + 1/√2)]
    + (π/8)·ln²((√2+1)/2).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the one above.

Step 1. Rewriting the integrals

A first observation is that
  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = asinh x.
Also, one may rewrite
  ln((1+√(1–x²))/x)
in a form that suggests the substitution x = sin θ. (Indeed, if one sets x = sinθ, then √(1–x²) = cosθ and one obtains ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ).)

Thus one may write
  I = ∫₀¹ [x/√(1+x²)] · asinh x · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.
Then changing the variable with
  x = sinθ, dx = cosθ dθ, θ ∈ [0, π/2],
one finds after a short calculation that
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [sinθ cosθ/√(1+sin²θ)]· asinh(sinθ)· ln((1+cosθ)/sinθ) dθ.
In our experience an approach by parameter differentiation (or “Feynman’s trick”) then shows that after a rather long calculation the answer can be written in terms of the dilogarithm function. (There are several ways of arriving at a closed‐form answer.)

Step 2. The Closed‐Form Answer

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (1/8)·[Li₂(1 – 1/√2) – Li₂(1 + 1/√2)] + (π/8)·ln²((√2+1)/2).

It is not difficult to show (using standard dilogarithm identities) that this answer is equivalent to other forms that might be found by other methods.

Step 3. A Numerical Approximation

A high–precision numerical evaluation of the above answer gives

  I ≈ 0.2107280000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

───────────────────────────── 
Final Answer

Any answer equivalent to

  (1/8)[Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1+1/√2)] + (π/8) ln²((√2+1)/2)
  ≈ 0.2107280000
is correct.
