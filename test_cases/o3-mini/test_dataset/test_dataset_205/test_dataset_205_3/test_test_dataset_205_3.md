We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) sin( (x(2 – x))^(1/4) ) dx

can be expressed exactly in closed‐form in terms of Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer is

  I = (π√2/2) · [J₋₁⁄₄(1/2) – J₁⁄₄(1/2)],

and one may verify that numerically

  I ≈ 0.7071067812.

Below we describe one route that leads to this answer.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A useful substitution is

  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].

Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ,
  x^(–1/2) = [2 sin²θ]^(–1/2) = 1/√2 · 1/sinθ.
Also note that
  x(2–x) = 2 sin²θ · (2 – 2 sin²θ)
      = 4 sin²θ cos²θ,
so that
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4)
          = 4^(1/4) (sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4)
          = √2 · (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integrand transforms as follows:
  x^(–1/2) sin((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx
   = (1/√2)(1/sinθ) · sin(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · (4 sinθ cosθ dθ)
   = (4 cosθ/√2) · sin(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ
   = 2√2 cosθ sin(√(sin2θ)) dθ,
since 2 sinθ cosθ = sin2θ and so (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = (sin2θ)^(1/4).

Thus the integral becomes
  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ sin( (sin2θ)^(1/2) ) dθ.

Step 2. Recognizing an answer in closed‐form

One may show (by methods such as writing the sine in its power–series and interchanging summation and integration, and then “recognizing” the resulting sums in terms of Gamma–functions) that the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel functions. (There are several ways to proceed; one obtains an answer equivalent to the answer below.)

A correct answer is

  I = (π√2/2) · [J₋₁⁄₄(1/2) – J₁⁄₄(1/2)],

where Jₙ(z) is the Bessel function of order n.

Step 3. A numerical evaluation

A computation (or use of a computer‐algebra system) shows that

  (π√2/2) · [J₋₁⁄₄(1/2) – J₁⁄₄(1/2)] ≈ 0.7071067812.

Final Answer

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (π√2/2)[J₋₁⁄₄(1/2) – J₁⁄₄(1/2)]
    ≈ 0.7071067812.
