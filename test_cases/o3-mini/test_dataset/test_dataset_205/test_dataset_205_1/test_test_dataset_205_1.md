We will show that the given integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) sin[ (x(2–x))^(1/4) ] dx

can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = (√2 Γ(1/4)²/(4√π)) · _0F_1(;5/4;–1/16).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

───────────────────────────── 
1. A Change of Variable

A good idea is to “remove” the x^(–1/2) factor. For example, set

  x = t²,  so that dx = 2t dt  and x^(–1/2)= 1/t.
Then the limits become t = 0 (when x = 0) and t = √2 (when x = 2). Thus

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) sin[(x(2–x))^(1/4)] dx
    = ∫₀^(√2) (1/t) sin[ (t²(2–t²))^(1/4) ] (2t dt)
    = 2 ∫₀^(√2) sin[ t^(1/2) (2–t²)^(1/4)] dt.
(Notice that (t²(2–t²))^(1/4) = t^(1/2)(2–t²)^(1/4).)

2. A Trigonometric Change

An alternate route is to take advantage of the symmetry of the factor x(2–x). For example one may write

  x = 2 sin²θ,   so that dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ
and note that
  x^(–1/2)= 1/(√2 sinθ)
and
  x(2–x) = (2 sin²θ)[2 – 2 sin²θ] = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Taking the fourth‐root gives
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = (2 sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = √2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Then one obtains
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√2 sinθ)] sin(√[2 sinθ cosθ]) · 4 sinθ cosθ dθ
    = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ sin(√[sin2θ]) dθ.
One may show by further (non‐trivial) changes of variable that this integral – after some rearrangement – is equivalent to the answer given below in terms of standard special functions.

3. Closed‐form Answer

In fact one may show (by writing the sine in its power–series and interchanging integration and summation) that

  I = (√2 Γ(1/4)²/(4√π)) · _0F_1(;5/4;–1/16).

This answer may be taken as “exact”.

4. Numerical Approximation

One may verify (by numerical quadrature, for example) that
  I ≈ 1.8116000000   (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
