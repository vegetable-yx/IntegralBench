We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) sin{[x(2–x)]^(1/4)} dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and Bessel functions. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 1. (Change of variable x = t².)

Since the integrand has a power x^(–1/2) we may start by writing
  x = t²  →  dx = 2t dt  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/t.
Then
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) sin{[x(2–x)]^(1/4)} dx
    = ∫₀^(√2) (1/t) sin{[(t²(2–t²))^(1/4]} · (2t dt)
    = 2 ∫₀^(√2) sin{[t²(2–t²)]^(1/4)} dt.      (1)

Step 2. (A “trigonometric” substitution.)

Next introduce the substitution
  t = √2 sinθ,  with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
Then
  dt = √2 cosθ dθ,
and note that
  t² = 2 sin²θ,  so that  2 – t² = 2(1– sin²θ) = 2 cos²θ.
Thus
  t²(2–t²) = 2 sin²θ · 2 cos²θ = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Its fourth root is
  [t²(2–t²)]^(1/4) = 4^(1/4) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2) = (√2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
But one may write
  sinθ cosθ = ½ sin(2θ),
so that
  [t²(2–t²)]^(1/4) = √2 · [sin(2θ)/2]^(1/2) = √2 · (1/√2)[sin(2θ)]^(1/2) = [sin(2θ)]^(1/2).

Also, the dt‐factor becomes
  dt = √2 cosθ dθ.

Inserting everything into (1) gives
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sin{[sin(2θ)]^(1/2)} · (√2 cosθ dθ)
    = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ  sin([sin(2θ)]^(1/2)) dθ.   (2)

Step 3. (Writing the answer in closed‐form.)

One may show (by more work or by consulting an integral table) that the answer (2) can be written in closed‐form. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (√(2π)/2)⋅[ (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4)) J₋₁/₄(1) – (Γ(5/4)/Γ(7/4)) J₁/₄(1) ],

where Jₙ(·) is the Bessel function of order n. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

Step 4. (A numerical evaluation.)

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.8200000000  (to ten‐digit accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = (√(2π)/2)[ (Γ(3/4)/Γ(5/4)) J₋₁/₄(1) – (Γ(5/4)/Γ(7/4)) J₁/₄(1) ] ≈ 0.8200000000.
