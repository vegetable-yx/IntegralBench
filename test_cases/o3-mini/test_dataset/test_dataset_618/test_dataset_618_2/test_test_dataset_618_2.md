We begin by rewriting the integrand by using the identity:

  1/x - ⌊1/x⌋

Notice that for x ∈ (0, 1] the function ⌊1/x⌋ takes the constant integer value n for x in the interval [1/(n+1), 1/n) for each positive integer n. Thus the original integral becomes a sum over the intervals:

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x - ⌊1/x⌋) dx = Σₙ₌₁∞ ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) [1/x - n] dx.

For a fixed integer n the integral is computed as follows:

1. Compute the antiderivative of 1/x:
  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) 1/x dx = [ln x] from x = 1/(n+1) to x = 1/n = ln(1/n) - ln(1/(n+1)) = ln((n+1)/n).

2. Compute the integral of the constant n:
  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) n dx = n [x]₁/(n+1)^(1/n) = n (1/n - 1/(n+1)) = 1 - (n/(n+1)) = 1/(n+1).

Thus, the integral over the interval for a given n is:
  ln((n+1)/n) - 1/(n+1).

Summing over all positive integers n gives:
  I = Σₙ₌₁∞ [ln((n+1)/n) - 1/(n+1)].

The logarithmic sum can be telescoped:
  Σₙ₌₁ᴺ ln((n+1)/n) = ln(N+1).

Also, Σₙ₌₁ᴺ 1/(n+1) = Hₙ₊₁ - 1, where Hₙ₊₁ is the (N+1)th harmonic number.

Thus, the Nth partial sum becomes:
  Iₙ = ln(N+1) - (Hₙ₊₁ - 1) = ln(N+1) - Hₙ₊₁ + 1.

It is known that as N → ∞, Hₙ₊₁ ~ ln(N+1) + γ, where γ is Euler’s constant. Therefore, taking the limit:

  I = limₙ→∞ [ln(N+1) - (ln(N+1) + γ) + 1] = 1 - γ.

Hence the exact result of the integral is 1 - γ.

The numerical approximation of Euler’s constant is about 0.5772156649, so

  1 - γ ≈ 1 - 0.5772156649 = 0.4227843351.
