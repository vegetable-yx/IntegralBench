We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x − ⎣1/x⎦) dx.

Note that 1/x − ⎣1/x⎦ is the fractional part of 1/x, usually denoted by {1/x}.

Step 1. Partition the interval [0,1]:

For a positive integer n, when x is in the interval [1/(n+1), 1/n], we have
  n ≤ 1/x < n+1  and  ⎣1/x⎦ = n.
Thus, on this subinterval,
  {1/x} = 1/x − n.

So we write the integral as the sum:
  I = Σₙ₌₁^∞ ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) (1/x − n) dx.

Step 2. Evaluate the integral on each subinterval:

On [1/(n+1), 1/n] the integral is
  Iₙ = ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) (1/x) dx − n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) dx.

Calculate the first part:
  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) (1/x) dx = [ln x] evaluated from x = 1/(n+1) to x = 1/n 
    = ln(1/n) − ln(1/(n+1)) = ln((n+1)/n) = ln(1 + 1/n).

Calculate the second part:
  ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) dx = (1/n − 1/(n+1) )  (since the length of the interval is 1/n − 1/(n+1)).
So:
  n ∫₁/(n+1)^(1/n) dx = n(1/n − 1/(n+1)) = 1 − n/(n+1) = 1/(n+1).

Thus, 
  Iₙ = ln(1 + 1/n) − 1/(n+1).

Step 3. Sum over n:

We now sum:
  I = Σₙ₌₁^∞ ( ln(1 + 1/n) − 1/(n+1) ).

Notice that the sum of the logarithmic terms telescopes:
  Σₙ₌₁ᴺ ln(1 + 1/n) = ln[(2/1)·(3/2)·…·((N+1)/N)] = ln(N+1).

Similarly,
  Σₙ₌₁ᴺ 1/(n+1) = (Hₙ₊₁ − 1),
where Hₙ₊₁ is the (N+1)th harmonic number.

Thus, the Nth partial sum is:
  I_N = ln(N+1) − (Hₙ₊₁ − 1) = ln(N+1) − Hₙ₊₁ + 1.

As N → ∞, recall that
  Hₙ₊₁ = ln(N+1) + γ + εₙ  (with εₙ → 0),
so that:
  I = limₙ→∞ (ln(N+1) − [ln(N+1) + γ] + 1) = 1 − γ.

Step 4. Numerical approximation:

The Euler–Mascheroni constant γ is approximately 0.5772156649, hence:
  1 − γ ≈ 0.4227843351.
