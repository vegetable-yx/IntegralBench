We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2π) [1/(1 + √(1 – sin² x))] dx.

Note that since √(1 – sin² x) = |cos x|, we may rewrite the integrand as

  1/(1 + |cos x|).

Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(2π) [1/(1 + |cos x|)] dx.

Because of the symmetry of |cos x|, we can break up the interval into pieces. In particular, noticing that the function is symmetric about x = π and that the behavior in [0, π/2] is replicated in the other regions, one efficient method is to write

  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(1 + cos x)] dx.

Now, use the trigonometric identity:
  1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2).

Thus,
  I = 4 ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(2 cos²(x/2))] dx = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sec²(x/2) dx.

Make the substitution u = x/2 so that dx = 2 du, and note that when x = 0, u = 0 and when x = π/2, u = π/4. The integral becomes

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/4) sec² u · 2 du = 4 ∫₀^(π/4) sec² u du.

Since ∫ sec² u du = tan u, we obtain

  I = 4 [tan u]₀^(π/4) = 4 (tan(π/4) – tan(0)) = 4 (1 – 0) = 4.

Thus, the exact value of the integral is 4.

A numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is 4.0000000000.
