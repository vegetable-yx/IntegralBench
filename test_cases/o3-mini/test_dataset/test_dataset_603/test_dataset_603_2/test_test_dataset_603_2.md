We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2π) 1 / (1 + √(1 – sin²x)) dx.

Step 1. Rewrite the integrand using a trigonometric identity:
  Note that 1 – sin²x = cos²x, so √(1 – sin²x) = |cos x|.

Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(2π) 1 / (1 + |cos x|) dx.

Step 2. Use the periodicity and symmetry of the integrand:
  Since |cos x| is periodic with period π (because cos(x+π) = –cos x and |–cos x| = |cos x|), we have

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π) 1 / (1 + |cos x|) dx.

Furthermore, on the interval [0, π] the cosine function changes behavior:
  • For x in [0, π/2], cos x ≥ 0, hence |cos x| = cos x.
  • For x in [π/2, π], cos x ≤ 0, hence |cos x| = –cos x.

Thus, splitting the integral we write:

  I = 2 { ∫₀^(π/2) 1 / (1 + cos x) dx + ∫_(π/2)^(π) 1 / (1 – cos x) dx }.

Step 3. Evaluate the first part:
  A. Compute J₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(1 + cos x) dx.
   Use the identity: 1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2). Then

   J₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(2 cos²(x/2)) dx = 1/2 ∫₀^(π/2) sec²(x/2) dx.

   Let u = x/2, so dx = 2 du, and when x = 0, u = 0; when x = π/2, u = π/4. Then

   J₁ = 1/2 ∫₀^(π/4) sec² u · 2 du = ∫₀^(π/4) sec² u du = [tan u]₀^(π/4) = tan(π/4) – tan 0 = 1 – 0 = 1.

Step 4. Evaluate the second part:
  B. Compute J₂ = ∫_(π/2)^(π) 1/(1 – cos x) dx.
   For x in [π/2, π], use the identity: 1 – cos x = 2 sin²(x/2). Then

   J₂ = ∫_(π/2)^(π) 1/(2 sin²(x/2)) dx = 1/2 ∫_(π/2)^(π) csc²(x/2) dx.

   Again let t = x/2, so dx = 2 dt, and when x = π/2, t = π/4; when x = π, t = π/2. Then

   J₂ = 1/2 ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) csc² t · 2 dt = ∫_(π/4)^(π/2) csc² t dt = [–cot t]_(π/4)^(π/2).

   Since cot(π/2) = 0 and cot(π/4) = 1, we get

   J₂ = (–cot(π/2)) – (–cot(π/4)) = (0 – (–1)) = 1.

Step 5. Combine the parts:
  The integral over [0, π] is

  ∫₀^(π) 1/(1 + |cos x|) dx = J₁ + J₂ = 1 + 1 = 2.

  Since the period argument gave I = 2 × [this integral], we have

  I = 2 × 2 = 4.

Step 6. Numerical Approximation:
  The exact answer is 4, so the numerical approximation is 4.0000000000 when rounded to 10 decimal places.
