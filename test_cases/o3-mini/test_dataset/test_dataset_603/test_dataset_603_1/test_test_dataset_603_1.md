We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀^(2π) 1/(1 + √(1 − sin²x)) dx.

Step 1. Simplify the Integrand

Notice that √(1 − sin²x) = √(cos²x) = |cos x|. Therefore,
  I = ∫₀^(2π) 1/(1 + |cos x|) dx.

Step 2. Split the Integration Interval

The absolute value requires splitting the interval where cos x is nonnegative or negative. Cosine is nonnegative on [0, π/2] and [3π/2, 2π], and negative on [π/2, 3π/2]. Thus we write

  I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃,

where
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) 1/(1 + cos x) dx,
  I₂ = ∫₍π/2₎^(3π/2) 1/(1 + (−cos x)) dx = ∫₍π/2₎^(3π/2) 1/(1 − cos x) dx,
  I₃ = ∫₍3π/2₎^(2π) 1/(1 + cos x) dx.

By symmetry, I₁ = I₃.

Step 3. Compute I₁

Using the identity 1 + cos x = 2 cos²(x/2),
  I₁ = ∫₀^(π/2) dx/(2 cos²(x/2)) = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sec²(x/2) dx.
Make the substitution u = x/2 (so that du = dx/2 and dx = 2 du). The limits change as follows: when x = 0, u = 0; when x = π/2, u = π/4. Hence,
  I₁ = (1/2) ∫₀^(π/4) sec²(u)·(2 du) = ∫₀^(π/4) sec²(u) du = tan u |₀^(π/4) = tan(π/4) − tan(0) = 1 − 0 = 1.

Thus, I₁ = 1 and likewise I₃ = 1.

Step 4. Compute I₂

Using the identity 1 − cos x = 2 sin²(x/2),
  I₂ = ∫₍π/2₎^(3π/2) dx/(1 − cos x) = ∫₍π/2₎^(3π/2) dx/(2 sin²(x/2)) = (1/2) ∫₍π/2₎^(3π/2) csc²(x/2) dx.
Again, substitute u = x/2 (thus dx = 2 du). The limits now are: when x = π/2, u = π/4; when x = 3π/2, u = 3π/4. This gives
  I₂ = (1/2) ∫₍π/4₎^(3π/4) csc²(u)·(2 du) = ∫₍π/4₎^(3π/4) csc²(u) du.
Recall that ∫ csc²(u) du = −cot u, so
  I₂ = [−cot u]₍π/4₎^(3π/4) = [−cot(3π/4) + cot(π/4)].
Since cot(π/4) = 1 and cot(3π/4) = −1, we have
  I₂ = [−(−1) + 1] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Step 5. Final Calculation

Now combine the three parts:
  I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

The exact answer is 4 and the numerical approximation of 4 is 4.0000000000.
