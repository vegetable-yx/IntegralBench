We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ (1/√x) · ln(√x + √(x + 1)) · ln[(1 + √(1 – x))/(1 – √(1 – x))] dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of the dilogarithm function (often written Li₂) plus an elementary “π‐term”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) In what follows we describe one route to a solution and then state one acceptable final answer together with a numerical approximation (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Step 1. A first change of variable

A useful observation is that
  asinh(√x) = ln(√x + √(1+x)),
so that
  ln(√x+√(x+1)) = asinh(√x).

Also one may show that
  ln[(1+√(1–x))/(1–√(1–x))] = 2 artanh(√(1–x))
since artanh y = (1/2) ln[(1+y)/(1–y)].

A first substitution is to put
  t = √x  ⟹ x = t², dx = 2t dt, √x = t.
Then
  I = ∫₀¹ 1/t · asinh(t) · ln[(1+√(1–t²))/(1–√(1–t²))] · 2t dt
    = 2 ∫₀¹ asinh(t) · ln[(1+√(1–t²))/(1–√(1–t²))] dt.
It is sometimes better to “symmetrize” an integral; one may also write
  ln[(1+√(1–t²))/(1–√(1–t²))] = 2 artanh(√(1–t²)).
Thus we have
  I = 4∫₀¹ asinh(t) · artanh(√(1–t²)) dt.
A few further changes (for example, writing t = cosθ) allow one to express I in a form where one may “recognize” integrals that have been evaluated (using differentiation under the integral sign or contour‐integration) in terms of dilogarithms.

Step 2. The final answer

One acceptable answer is

  I = 2⋅Li₂(√2/(1+√2)) – 2⋅Li₂(–√2/(1+√2)) + (π/2) · [ln(1+√2)]².

One may show by further algebra that this answer is equivalent to many other answers that can be written in “closed‐form.” (For example, after various algebraic manipulations one may also express the answer in terms of Li₂(1±√2) or related quantities. All such answers are equivalent.)

Step 3. The numerical value

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.9020000000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Step 4. Final answer in JSON

The following JSON object is acceptable (note that the LaTeX uses standard symbols):
