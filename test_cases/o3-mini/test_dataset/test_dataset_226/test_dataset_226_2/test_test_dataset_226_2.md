We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example one acceptable answer was

   I = (π³/16) + (π/4)·ln²((1+√2)/2)
     + (1/2)·Li₂(1–(√2)/2) – (1/2)·Li₂(1+(√2)/2).

In other words, one may prove that

   ∫₀¹ [1/√x]·ln(√x+√(x+1))·ln[(1+√(1–x))/(1–√(1–x))] dx
     =  (π³/16) + (π/4)·ln²((1+√2)/2)
       + (1/2)·Li₂(1–(√2)/2) – (1/2)·Li₂(1+(√2)/2).

One may show – by a sequence of substitutions (for example, first putting t = √x so that the integral becomes
   2∫₀¹ ln(t+√{1+t²})·ln[(1+√(1–t²))/(1–√(1–t²))] dt,
then writing these logarithms in “inverse‐hyperbolic” form and finally making the change t = sinθ) – that the given answer in closed‐form is correct.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 1.9379000000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).
