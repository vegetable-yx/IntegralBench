We are asked to compute the Riemann–Stieltjes integral

  I = ∫₀³ (x² + 1) d⌊x⌋,

where ⌊x⌋ is the floor function. The key observation is that the floor function is constant on each interval [n, n+1) and jumps by 1 at each positive integer. For x in [0, 3], the jumps occur at x = 1, 2, and 3.

The Riemann–Stieltjes integral with respect to a function of bounded variation (like ⌊x⌋) that has jump discontinuities is given by the sum
  I = Σ (x² + 1)|₍ₓ₌ₖ₎ × Δ⌊x⌋,
where the summation is taken over the jump points in (0, 3] and Δ⌊x⌋ is the size of the jump at that point.

Step 1. Identify jump points and compute jump sizes:
• At x = 1, ⌊1⁻⌋ = 0 and ⌊1⌋ = 1, so Δ⌊x⌋ = 1.
• At x = 2, ⌊2⁻⌋ = 1 and ⌊2⌋ = 2, so Δ⌊x⌋ = 1.
• At x = 3, ⌊3⁻⌋ = 2 and ⌊3⌋ = 3, so Δ⌊x⌋ = 1.

Step 2. Evaluate the integrand at each jump point:
• At x = 1, (1² + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
• At x = 2, (2² + 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.
• At x = 3, (3² + 1) = 9 + 1 = 10.

Step 3. Sum the contributions at each jump:
  I = 2·1 + 5·1 + 10·1 = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17.

Thus, the exact answer is 17.

Step 4. Provide a numerical approximation (rounded to 10 decimal places):
  17.0000000000
