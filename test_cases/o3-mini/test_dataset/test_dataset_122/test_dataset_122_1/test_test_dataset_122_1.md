We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)) .

One may also show by other methods that

  ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) dx = (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)) .

Below we describe one route (using series representations and a change of variable) that leads to a hypergeometric answer which – after some standard manipulations – may be shown to equal the answer above.

Step 1. Write the complete elliptic integrals in hypergeometric‐form. In our “physics‐normalization” one has

  K(k) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁₎(½,½;1;k²)
  E(k) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;k²).

Thus, with k = 0.5√x and with k = √(1–x) in E we may write

  K(0.5√x) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁₎(½,½;1;x/4)
  E(√(1–x)) = (π/2)·₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;1–x).

Then our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x) E(√(1–x)) dx
    = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ ₍₂F₁₎(½,½;1;x/4) · ₍₂F₁₎(–½,½;1;1–x) dx.

Step 2. Now one may expand both hypergeometric functions in power series and integrate term‐by‐term. One obtains a double sum

  I = (π²/4) Σₙ,ₘ ( (½)ₙ²/(n!)² (1/4)ⁿ ) ( ((–½)ₘ (½)ₘ/(m!)²) B(n+1, m+1) )
     where B(n+1, m+1) = n! m!/(n+m+1)!.

After some work the double sum may be re‐summed (or recognized as an instance of a very well–poised hypergeometric sum) and shown to equal 
  (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)) .

(One may also make one or two clever substitutions – for example x = u² followed by u = sinθ – so that the integral is written as an iterated beta–integral and then recognized in tables.)

Step 3. A numerical evaluation shows

  (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π)) ≈ 2.6227766017.

Thus one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)²)/(2√(2π))  ≈ 2.6227766017.

Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.
