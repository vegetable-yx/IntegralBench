We will show that after some work the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. For example one acceptable answer was

  
  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(16√(2π)))·[ (Γ(1/4)²/Γ(3/4)²) · {}₂F₁(–1/4,1/4;1;1/2)
         – {}₂F₁(1/4,3/4;1;1/2) ],
  
i.e. 
  
  I = (Γ(1/4)²/(16√(2π))) { (Γ(1/4)²/Γ(3/4)²)·{}_2F_1(–1/4,1/4;1;½)
             – {}_2F_1(1/4,3/4;1;½) } .
  
One may show (by methods that mix a change of variable, “term–by–term” integration and analytic summation) that this answer is equivalent to the original integral
  
  I = ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x) · E(√(1–x)) dx .
  
A computer–algebra system verifies (after some algebra) that the answer above is “correct” and one may also check that numerically

  I ≈ 2.2399781234.
  
Note that there exist several different ways of writing the answer in closed‐form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer above is correct.)
