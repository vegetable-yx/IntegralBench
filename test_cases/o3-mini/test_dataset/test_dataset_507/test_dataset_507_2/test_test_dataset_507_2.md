We begin by writing the integral as a sum of three simpler integrals:
  I = ∫₀⁶ [x + (x−3)⁷ + sin(x−3)] dx
   = ∫₀⁶ x dx + ∫₀⁶ (x−3)⁷ dx + ∫₀⁶ sin(x−3) dx

Step 1. Compute ∫₀⁶ x dx:
  ∫₀⁶ x dx = [x²/2]₀⁶ = (6²/2) − (0²/2) = 36/2 = 18.

Step 2. Compute ∫₀⁶ (x−3)⁷ dx:
Make a substitution: Let u = x − 3, so du = dx. When x = 0, u = −3, and when x = 6, u = 3.
  ∫₀⁶ (x−3)⁷ dx = ∫₋₃³ u⁷ du.
Since u⁷ is an odd function and the interval [−3, 3] is symmetric about 0, this integral evaluates to 0.

Step 3. Compute ∫₀⁶ sin(x−3) dx:
Similarly, using the substitution u = x − 3, du = dx, with u limits from −3 to 3:
  ∫₀⁶ sin(x−3) dx = ∫₋₃³ sin u du.
Since sin u is an odd function and [−3, 3] is symmetric, this integral is also 0.

Thus, adding the results:
  I = 18 + 0 + 0 = 18.

The numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is 18.0000000000.
