We start with the integral

  I = ∫₀⁶ [x + (x – 3)⁷ + sin(x – 3)] dx.

Step 1. Split the integral into three separate parts:
  I = ∫₀⁶ x dx + ∫₀⁶ (x – 3)⁷ dx + ∫₀⁶ sin(x – 3) dx.

Step 2. Evaluate each integral.

A) For the first term:
  ∫₀⁶ x dx = [x²/2]₀⁶ = (6²/2) – (0²/2) = 36/2 = 18.

B) For the second term, perform the substitution:
  Let u = x – 3, so that du = dx.
  When x = 0, u = –3; when x = 6, u = 3.
  Then ∫₀⁶ (x – 3)⁷ dx = ∫₋₃³ u⁷ du.
Since u⁷ is an odd function and the limits of integration are symmetric about 0, the integral evaluates to 0.

C) For the third term, use a similar substitution:
  Let u = x – 3, then when x = 0, u = –3 and when x = 6, u = 3.
  Thus, ∫₀⁶ sin(x – 3) dx = ∫₋₃³ sin(u) du.
Again, sin(u) is an odd function and the interval is symmetric, so this integral is 0.

Step 3. Combine the results:
  I = 18 + 0 + 0 = 18.

Step 4. The exact answer is 18 and its numerical approximation to ten decimal places is 18.0000000000.
