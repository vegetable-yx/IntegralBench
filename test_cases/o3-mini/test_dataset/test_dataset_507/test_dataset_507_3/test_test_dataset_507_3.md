We are to evaluate
  I = ∫₀⁶ [ x + (x – 3)⁷ + sin(x – 3) ] dx.

Step 1. Split the integral into three parts:
  I = ∫₀⁶ x dx + ∫₀⁶ (x – 3)⁷ dx + ∫₀⁶ sin(x – 3) dx.

Step 2. Compute each integral separately.

Part A: ∫₀⁶ x dx  
  The antiderivative is x²/2. Evaluated from 0 to 6:
  = [6²/2] – [0²/2] = (36/2) = 18.

Part B: ∫₀⁶ (x – 3)⁷ dx  
  Let u = x – 3. Then, when x = 0, u = –3; when x = 6, u = 3; and dx = du.
  So, the integral becomes ∫₋₃³ u⁷ du.
  Since u⁷ is an odd function (f(–u) = –f(u)) and the limits are symmetric about 0, this integral is 0.

Part C: ∫₀⁶ sin(x – 3) dx  
  Again, let u = x – 3, then when x = 0, u = –3; when x = 6, u = 3; and dx = du.
  So, the integral becomes ∫₋₃³ sin u du.
  The antiderivative of sin u is –cos u. Evaluated from –3 to 3:
  = [–cos u]₋₃³ = (–cos 3) – (–cos(–3)) = –cos 3 + cos(–3).
  Since cosine is an even function (cos(–3) = cos 3), the result simplifies to 0.

Step 3. Adding the results:
  I = 18 + 0 + 0 = 18.

Step 4. A numerical approximation to 10 decimal places:
  18.0000000000
