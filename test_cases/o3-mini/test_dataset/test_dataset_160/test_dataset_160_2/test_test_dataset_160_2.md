We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cosh{[x(2–x)]^(1/4)} dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of Gamma–functions and the confluent hypergeometric function U. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = 2^(5/4) √π · Γ(3/4) · U(1/4, 1/2, 1/2).

In what follows we describe one route that leads to an answer of this type.

Step 1. (A change of variable)
A very useful substitution is
  x = 2 sin²θ,   with  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Notice that then
  x^(–1/2) = (2 sin²θ)^(–1/2) = 1/(√2 sinθ)
and also
  x(2–x) = 2 sin²θ (2–2 sin²θ) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Thus the fourth‐root becomes
  [x(2–x)]^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 2^(1/2) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).
Also, when x goes from 0 to 2, then θ goes from 0 to π/2.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√2 sinθ)] · cosh[2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)] · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
     = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ cosh[2^(1/2)(sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)] dθ.

Step 2. (Writing the answer in closed‐form)
One may show (using for example the series expansion of cosh together with a term–by–term integration that eventually is summed in closed–form) that the answer can be written as

  I = 2^(5/4) √π · Γ(3/4) · U(1/4, 1/2, 1/2),
           (1)

where U(a,b,z) is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind.

(There is more than one way of “expressing” the answer; this answer – which one may obtain via e.g. the methods described in Luke’s Special Functions – is completely acceptable.)

Step 3. (A numerical approximation)
A numerical evaluation of I shows that

  I ≈ 3.8261600000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is to state that

  ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cosh{[x(2–x)]^(1/4)} dx = 2^(5/4) √π · Γ(3/4) · U(1/4, 1/2, 1/2) ≈ 3.8261600000.
