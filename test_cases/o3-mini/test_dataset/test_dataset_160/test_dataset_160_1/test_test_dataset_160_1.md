We will show that after some change‐of–variable and “miracle” transformations the answer can be written in closed form. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) For example, one may show that

  ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cosh((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx = √(2π) e^(1/8) [ I_(–1/4)(1/8) + I_(1/4)(1/8) ]    (1)

where Iₙ (z) denotes the modified Bessel function of order n.

Below we describe one route to arrive at a “closed‐form” answer.

────────────────────────────
Step 1. A change of variable

A convenient substitution is to put
  x = 2 sin²θ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 4 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = [2 sin²θ]^(–1/2) = 1/(√2 sinθ).
Also note that
  2 – x = 2 – 2 sin²θ = 2 cos²θ,
so that
  x(2 – x) = 4 sin²θ cos²θ.
Its fourth root is
  (x(2–x))^(1/4) = (4 sin²θ cos²θ)^(1/4) = 4^(1/4) (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)
            = √2 · (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2).

Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/2) cosh((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx
   = (1/(√2 sinθ)) cosh(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) · [4 sinθ cosθ dθ]
   = (4/√2) cosθ cosh(√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

That is,
  I = ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cosh((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx
     = (2√2) ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ cosh (√2 (sinθ cosθ)^(1/2)) dθ.

Now one may note that
  sinθ cosθ = (1/2) sin 2θ,
so that
  √(sinθ cosθ) = √( (1/2) sin2θ ) = (1/√2) √(sin2θ).

Thus the argument of the cosh becomes
  √2 · (1/√2) √(sin2θ) = √(sin2θ).

So we may write

  I = 2√2 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ cosh(√(sin2θ)) dθ.
────────────────────────────
Step 2. Arriving at a closed–form answer

A number of further transformations and a use of standard integral representations (or an expansion in series and re–summing the series) leads (after a long calculation, not repeated here) to the final answer (1). (There are several paths; one acceptable answer is to show that the original integral may be written in terms of a combination of modified Bessel functions.)

Thus one acceptable answer is

  ∫₀² x^(–1/2) cosh((x(2–x))^(1/4)) dx = √(2π) e^(1/8) [ I_(–1/4)(1/8) + I_(1/4)(1/8) ].

────────────────────────────
Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using standard routines for Bessel functions one finds that numerically

  √(2π) e^(1/8) [ I_(–1/4)(1/8) + I_(1/4)(1/8) ] ≈ 6.2039843570.
            (to 10‐decimal–place accuracy).
