We wish to show that

  I = ∫₀¹ (x – 1)/[(x + 1) ln x] dx = ln(π/2).

One way to arrive at this answer is to “remove” the annoying logarithm in the denominator by using the identity

  (xᵃ – 1)/ln x = ∫₀ᵃ xᵗ dt  (for x > 0)

(which is easily verified by differentiating with respect to a).

Since in our integrand the numerator is x – 1, we take a = 1 so that
  (x – 1)/ln x = ∫₀¹ xᵗ dt.

Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/(x + 1)] (x – 1)/ln x dx 
    = ∫₀¹ (1/(x + 1)) (∫₀¹ xᵗ dt) dx.

Fubini’s theorem allows us to change the order of integration (the integrals converge nicely) so that

  I = ∫₀¹ (∫₀¹ xᵗ/(x + 1) dx) dt.

Now, note that for a fixed t the inner x–integral can be expanded in a convergent series when 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Since

  1/(1 + x) = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ xⁿ   (for |x| < 1; it converges uniformly on [0,1]),

we have

  ∫₀¹ xᵗ/(x + 1) dx = ∫₀¹ xᵗ Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ xⁿ dx
             = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ ∫₀¹ x^(t+n) dx
             = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ [1/(t+n+1)].

Hence

  I = ∫₀¹ (Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(t+n+1)) dt.

Since the sum converges uniformly with respect to t on [0,1] we may swap the order again:

  I = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ ∫₀¹ dt/(t+n+1)
    = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ ln((n+2)/(n+1)).

It is more convenient to re‐index this sum by writing m = n + 1 so that

  I = Σₘ₌₁∞ (–1)^(m–1) ln((m+1)/m).      (∗)

Now write each term ln((m+1)/m) as ln(m+1) – ln m and observe that the series in (∗) “telescopes” in a clever alternating way. To see this clearly we group the terms for m = 1, 2, 3, … as follows:

  I = [ln 2 – ln 1] – [ln 3 – ln 2] + [ln 4 – ln 3] – [ln 5 – ln 4] + … .

For convenience, separate the odd and even terms. That is, write

  I = Σₖ₌₁∞ { ln((2k)/(2k–1)) – ln((2k+1)/(2k)) } 
    = Σₖ₌₁∞ ln [ (2k/(2k–1)) · (2k/(2k+1)) ] 
    = ln ∏ₖ₌₁∞ [4k²/( (2k–1)(2k+1) )].

But the infinite product

  ∏ₖ₌₁∞ [4k²/(4k² – 1)]                  ( since (2k–1)(2k+1) = 4k² – 1)
   = π/2      (this is a well–known form of the Wallis product).

Thus we obtain

  I = ln(π/2).

A numerical evaluation gives

  ln(π/2) ≈ ln(1.5707963268) ≈ 0.4515827053.
