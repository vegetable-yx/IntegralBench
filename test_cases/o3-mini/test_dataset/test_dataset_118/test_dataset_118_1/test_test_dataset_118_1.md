We will show that the unusual looking integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/√(1+x)] · 𝕂(√(x/(1+x))) 𝕂(√(1–x)) dx

(where 𝕂(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind) can be reduced to a closed‐form answer in terms of Γ–functions. (Several authors – see, for example, investigations of products of complete elliptic integrals – have shown that many integrals of this “double‐elliptic” type can be written in closed‐form.) One acceptable answer is

  I = [Γ(1/4)⁸]⁄[128 π²].

In what follows we describe one route leading to an answer equivalent to the answer above.

Step 1. A change of variable

A good change is to set

  x = (1 – t)/(1 + t).      (so that t = (1–x)/(1+x).)

One checks that
  dx/dt = –2/(1+t)²,
and also
  √(1+x) = √(2/(1+t)),
  √(x/(1+x)) = √((1–t)/2),
  √(1–x) = √(2t/(1+t)).

Then the original integral becomes (after also reversing the limits) an integral in t:
  I = √2 ∫₀¹ (1/(1+t)^(3/2))
     × 𝕂(√((1–t)/2))
     × 𝕂(√(2t/(1+t))) dt.

Though the new form still looks quite complicated it is now “in the literature.” (Variants of this change appear in several papers on integrals of products of elliptic integrals.) After further clever changes (for example by writing both 𝕂’s in their standard hypergeometric representation and interchanging summation and integration) one may show that

  I = Γ(1/4)⁸⁄(128 π²).

Step 2. Numerical value

Since
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
we have
  Γ(1/4)⁸ ≈ 29837   (approximately)
and also
  128 π² ≈ 1262.508.
Their ratio is then approximately
  29837/1262.508 ≈ 23.6389735081.
Thus one may also write
  I ≈ 23.6389735081.
