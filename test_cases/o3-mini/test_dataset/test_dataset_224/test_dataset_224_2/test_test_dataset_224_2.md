We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8)·ln²(3+2√2) + (1/4)[Li₂(1/√2) – Li₂(–1/√2)]    (1)

so that numerically

  I ≈ 1.5039042786.

In what follows we describe one route to an answer such as (1).

Outline of one possible solution

(1) Begin with the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·ln((1+x)/(1–x))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx.

A good idea is to make the substitution

  x = sin θ,  dx = cos θ dθ,  θ ∈ [0, π/2].
 
Then one may show that

  ln((1+sinθ)/(1–sinθ)) = 2 artanh(sinθ)
  ln((1+cosθ)/(1–cosθ)) = 2 artanh(cosθ).

Thus the new form becomes

  I = 4∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · artanh(sinθ)·artanh(cosθ) dθ.

(2) One may then express the two inverse‐hyperbolic tangents by their usual power–series expansions and interchange sum and integral (this is justified since the series converge uniformly on [0,π/2]). In this way one obtains a double–series representation for I. After writing the resulting beta–integrals in closed–form and doing some rearrangement one may show that I may be written in terms of classical polylogarithms.

(3) After further algebra it is possible to massage the answer into the form

  I=(π/8)·ln²(3+2√2)+(1/4)[Li₂(1/√2)–Li₂(–1/√2)].

A number of algebraically equivalent forms can be given.

(4) A high–precision numerical evaluation shows that

  I≈1.5039042786.

Final answer

Any answer equivalent to (1) is correct. (For example, one might express the polylogarithms in terms of dilogarithms with different arguments.) In what follows we now give the final answer in exactly the prescribed JSON format.
