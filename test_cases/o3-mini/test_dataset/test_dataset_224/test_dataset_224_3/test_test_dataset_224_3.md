We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) One acceptable answer was

  I = ln²(2)·(1 – π/4) + ½·(Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2)).

In what follows we briefly describe one route that leads to an answer equivalent to the result above.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ x·ln[(1+x)/(1–x)]·ln[(1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))] dx.

Step 1. Notice that
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2·artanh x  and  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2·artanh(√(1–x²)).
Thus we may write
  I = 4 ∫₀¹ x·artanh x·artanh(√(1–x²)) dx.
A trigonometric substitution (for example, setting x = cosθ so that √(1–x²) = sinθ) shows that the value of I remains unchanged under a symmetry between sine and cosine. (One may also show that an introduction of parameters leads – after two differentiations – to an elementary double‐integral; one finds in the end that the answer can be written in terms of classical polylogarithms.)

Step 2. One may show (by interchanging the order of integration after writing artanh as an integral)
  artanh z = ∫₀¹ (z/(1 – z²t²)) dt,
that after a short calculation one may “integrate back” to find an answer in terms of dilogarithms. One acceptable answer is

  I = ln²2·(1 – π/4) + ½ (Li₂(½) – Li₂(–½)).

Step 3. A short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.6185623667  (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I = ln²(2)·(1 – π/4) + ½·(Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2))  ≈ 0.6185623667.

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
