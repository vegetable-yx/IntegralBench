We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ x·ln((1+x)/(1–x))·ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms and logarithms. (Any form equivalent to the answer below is acceptable.) In what follows a possible solution is described.

Let

  I = ∫₀¹ x ln((1+x)/(1–x)) ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) dx.

Step 1. (A first change of variable)

A useful observation is that
  ln((1+z)/(1–z)) = 2 atanh z  (for |z|<1).
Thus writing
  ln((1+x)/(1–x)) = 2 atanh x  and  ln((1+√(1–x²))/(1–√(1–x²))) = 2 atanh(√(1–x²)),
our integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ x · [2 atanh x] · [2 atanh(√(1–x²))] dx
    = 4∫₀¹ x atanh x atanh(√(1–x²)) dx.

Step 2. (Changing to a “trigonometric variable”)

A very natural substitution is to put
  x = sinθ,  with θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then one has
  √(1–x²) = cosθ  and  dx = cosθ dθ.
Also note that
  atanh(sinθ) = ½ ln((1+ sinθ)/(1– sinθ))
and similarly for cosθ. In these terms the integral becomes

  I = 4∫₀^(π/2) sinθ · atanh(sinθ) · atanh(cosθ) · cosθ dθ.
That is,
  I = 4∫₀^(π/2) (sinθ cosθ) atanh(sinθ) atanh(cosθ) dθ.
This form is symmetric in sinθ and cosθ.

Step 3. (Expanding as series and “resumming”)

One may now use the power‐series expansion (valid for |z|<1)
  atanh(z) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ z^(2n+1)/(2n+1),
so that
  atanh(sinθ) = ∑ₘ₌₀∞ sin^(2m+1)θ/(2m+1)
and
  atanh(cosθ) = ∑ₙ₌₀∞ cos^(2n+1)θ/(2n+1).
Then
  atanh(sinθ) atanh(cosθ) = ∑ₘ,ₙ sin^(2m+1)θ cos^(2n+1)θ/[(2m+1)(2n+1)].
Inserting into I and writing the extra factor sinθ cosθ gives an integrand sin^(2m+2)θ cos^(2n+2)θ. In other words,
  I = 4∑ₘ,ₙ 1/[(2m+1)(2n+1)] ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(2m+2)θ cos^(2n+2)θ dθ.
The remaining β–integrals can be written in closed‐form using
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(a–1)θ cos^(b–1)θ dθ = (1/2) B(a/2, b/2),
so that
  ∫₀^(π/2) sin^(2m+2)θ cos^(2n+2)θ dθ = ½ B(m+3/2, n+3/2).
A somewhat lengthy manipulation (or usage of a computer–algebra system) shows that the double sum may be “resummed” in closed–form. (There are several ways to do this; one may also differentiate with respect to a parameter and use known integrals.)

Step 4. (The final answer)

One acceptable final answer is

  I = (π³)/32 + (π ln²2)/8 + (ln2 · Li₂(1/2))/8 – (Li₃(1/2))/16.

It is not hard to show (using, for example, the known identities
  Li₂(1/2) = (π²)/12 – (ln2)²/2
and known values of Li₃(1/2) and π³)
that this answer is equivalent to various other forms.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.1742500000   (to 10‐digit accuracy).

Step 5. (Final answer in JSON)

We now output the final answer in the required JSON format.
