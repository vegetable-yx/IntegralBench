We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀^(2π) sin(sin(x) – x) dx.

Step 1. Express the integrand in a more convenient form.
Notice that
  sin(sin(x) – x) = – sin(x – sin(x)).
Thus, I can be written as
  I = – ∫₀^(2π) sin(x – sin(x)) dx.
However, instead of working with this form we now look for a symmetry that will simplify the evaluation.

Step 2. Show that the integrand is antisymmetric about x = π.
Define
  f(x) = sin(sin(x) – x).
Now perform the change of variable x → 2π – x:
  f(2π – x) = sin(sin(2π – x) – (2π – x)).
Recall that sin(2π – x) = – sin(x) (since sin(2π – x) = sin(2π) cos x – cos(2π) sin x = – sin x).
Thus,
  f(2π – x) = sin(– sin(x) – 2π + x) = sin(x – sin(x) – 2π).
Because sine is 2π–periodic we have sin(θ – 2π) = sin θ. Therefore,
  f(2π – x) = sin(x – sin(x)).
But note that
  sin(x – sin(x)) = – sin(sin(x) – x) = – f(x).
So we conclude that
  f(2π – x) = – f(x).

Step 3. Conclude by the antisymmetry.
Since f(2π – x) = – f(x) on the interval [0, 2π], the function f(x) is antisymmetric about x = π. This implies that the contributions from x in [0, π] and x in [π, 2π] cancel exactly. Explicitly, making the substitution x = 2π – u, the integral becomes
  ∫₀^(2π) f(x) dx = ∫₀^(2π) f(2π – u) du = ∫₀^(2π) [– f(u)] du = – ∫₀^(2π) f(u) du.
The only number equal to its own negative is 0. Therefore,
  I = 0.

Step 4. Provide a numerical approximation.
Since the exact answer is 0, the numerical approximation is also 0. Rounded to 10 decimal places, it is 0.0000000000.

Thus, the final answer is:

{"answer": "$0$", "numerical_answer": "0.0000000000"}
