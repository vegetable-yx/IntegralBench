We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀² x · H₃(√(x(2 − x))) dx

Step 1. Express H₃ in its explicit form.

For the (physicists’) Hermite polynomials, we have
  H₃(y) = 8y³ − 12y.
Thus, with y = √(x(2 − x)), the integrand becomes
  x [8 (x(2 − x))^(3/2) − 12 (x(2 − x))^(1/2)].
So, the integral is
  I = 8 ∫₀² x [x(2 − x)]^(3/2) dx − 12 ∫₀² x [x(2 − x)]^(1/2) dx.

Step 2. Simplify via a substitution.

Notice that
  x(2 − x) = 2x − x² = 1 − (x − 1)².
This suggests the substitution
  u = x − 1, so that x = 1 + u and dx = du.
When x goes from 0 to 2, u runs from −1 to 1. Also,
  x(2 − x) = 1 − u² and √(x(2 − x)) = √(1 − u²).

Therefore, the integral becomes
  I = 8 I₁ − 12 I₂,
with
  I₁ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 + u) (1 − u²)^(3/2) du  and  I₂ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 + u) (1 − u²)^(1/2) du.

Step 3. Evaluate I₁.

Write I₁ as two pieces:
  I₁ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 − u²)^(3/2) du + ∫₋₁¹ u (1 − u²)^(3/2) du.
The integrand u (1 − u²)^(3/2) is an odd function (since u is odd and (1 − u²)^(3/2) is even), so its integral over [−1, 1] is 0. Hence,
  I₁ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 − u²)^(3/2) du.
Since the integrand is even, this equals
  I₁ = 2 ∫₀¹ (1 − u²)^(3/2) du.

Now use the substitution u = sinθ, with du = cosθ dθ, and note that when u = 0, θ = 0, and when u = 1, θ = π⁄2. Then
  1 − u² = cos²θ and (1 − u²)^(3/2) = cos³θ.
Thus,
  I₁ = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos³θ · cosθ dθ = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos⁴θ dθ.
A standard result is
  ∫₀^(π/2) cos⁴θ dθ = 3π⁄16.
Hence,
  I₁ = 2 · (3π⁄16) = 3π⁄8.

Step 4. Evaluate I₂.

Similarly, write
  I₂ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 + u) (1 − u²)^(1/2) du
    = ∫₋₁¹ (1 − u²)^(1/2) du + ∫₋₁¹ u (1 − u²)^(1/2) du.
Again, u (1 − u²)^(1/2) is odd, so its integral vanishes. Thus,
  I₂ = ∫₋₁¹ (1 − u²)^(1/2) du.
This is a well-known integral, which gives the area of a semicircle of radius 1:
  I₂ = π⁄2.

Step 5. Combine the results.

Returning to the original expression for I,
  I = 8 I₁ − 12 I₂ = 8 · (3π⁄8) − 12 · (π⁄2) = 3π − 6π = −3π.

Step 6. Provide a numerical approximation.

Using π ≈ 3.1415926536, we have
  −3π ≈ −9.4247779608.

Thus, the exact answer is −3π, and numerically it is approximately −9.4247779608.
