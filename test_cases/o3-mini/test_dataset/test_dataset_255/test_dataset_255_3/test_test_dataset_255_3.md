We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀² x H₃(√(x(2 – x))) dx

where Hₙ(z) is the (physicists’) Hermite polynomial of order n. In particular, one has

  H₃(z) = 8z³ – 12z.

Thus,
  H₃(√(x(2 – x))) = 8[x(2 – x)]^(3/2) – 12[x(2 – x)]^(1/2).

Inserting this into the integral, we have

  I = ∫₀² x { 8[x(2 – x)]^(3/2) – 12[x(2 – x)]^(1/2) } dx
   = 8 ∫₀² x[x(2 – x)]^(3/2) dx – 12 ∫₀² x[x(2 – x)]^(1/2) dx.

A very useful change of variable is

  x = 1 + cosθ.

Then,
  dx = – sinθ dθ,
and note that
  x(2 – x) = (1 + cosθ)[2 – (1 + cosθ)] = (1 + cosθ)(1 – cosθ) = sin²θ.
Thus,
  [x(2 – x)]^(1/2) = sinθ   and  [x(2 – x)]^(3/2) = sin³θ.

Next, we must adjust the limits. When x = 0:
  0 = 1 + cosθ ⟹ cosθ = –1 ⟹ θ = π.
When x = 2:
  2 = 1 + cosθ ⟹ cosθ = 1 ⟹ θ = 0.

Thus, the integrals become (taking care with the sign when reversing the limits):

For the first piece:
  I₁ = ∫₀² x [x(2 – x)]^(3/2) dx
   = ∫_{θ=π}^{0} (1 + cosθ) sin³θ (– sinθ dθ)
   = ∫₀^π (1 + cosθ) sin⁴θ dθ.

Similarly, for the second piece:
  I₂ = ∫₀² x [x(2 – x)]^(1/2) dx
   = ∫_{θ=π}^{0} (1 + cosθ) sinθ (– sinθ dθ)
   = ∫₀^π (1 + cosθ) sin²θ dθ.

Thus the original integral can be written as

  I = 8I₁ – 12I₂ = 8 ∫₀^π (1 + cosθ) sin⁴θ dθ – 12 ∫₀^π (1 + cosθ) sin²θ dθ.

We now split each integral into two parts:
  I = 8 [∫₀^π sin⁴θ dθ + ∫₀^π cosθ sin⁴θ dθ] – 12 [∫₀^π sin²θ dθ + ∫₀^π cosθ sin²θ dθ].

Denote
  J(n) = ∫₀^π sinⁿθ dθ  and  K(n) = ∫₀^π cosθ sinⁿθ dθ.

It is a standard result that (or by symmetry) for n > 0 one finds that
  K(n) = 0.
(In particular, both K(4) and K(2) are zero.)

Also, the standard integrals for sine powers yield:
  J(2) = ∫₀^π sin²θ dθ = π/2,
  J(4) = ∫₀^π sin⁴θ dθ = 3π/8.

Thus, we have
  I = 8[J(4) + 0] – 12[J(2) + 0] = 8(3π/8) – 12(π/2) = 3π – 6π = –3π.

So, the exact answer is –3π.

For a numerical approximation, note that

  –3π ≈ –3 × 3.141592653589793 = –9.42477796076938.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is –9.4247779608.

The final answer in the required JSON format is:
