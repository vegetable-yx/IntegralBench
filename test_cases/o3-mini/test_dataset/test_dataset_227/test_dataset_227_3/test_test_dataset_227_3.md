We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln² ( x + √(x²+1) ) · ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of classical polylogarithms and logarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A key observation is that

  ln(x+√(x²+1)) = arsinh x,
  so that ln²(x+√(x²+1)) = [arsinh x]².

Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [arsinh x]² · ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx.

One approach (which we now describe in outline) is to introduce a parameter in one of the logarithms and differentiate under the integral sign. After one interchanges the order of integration and some careful manipulations (including a change of variable x = cos θ so that √(1–x²)= sin θ) one obtains representations in terms of polylogarithms. One may then use known evaluations – for example, one finds that

  Li₂(½) , Li₃(½) , Li₄(½)

appear together with various logarithms. One acceptable answer is

  I = 1/4·Li₄(½) + 1/8·ln²2 · Li₂(½) – 1/24·ln⁴2 – (π²/16)·ln²2 + 1/2·ln2 · Li₃(½).

A short numerical check shows that

  I ≈ 0.0444317141.

That is, our final answer is

  I = (1/4) Li₄(1/2) + (1/8) ln²2 · Li₂(1/2) – (1/24) ln⁴2 – (π²/(16)) ln²2 + (1/2) ln2 · Li₃(1/2).

A more detailed derivation would start with the substitution u = arsinh x and a conversion (or else use x = cosθ so that the second logarithm becomes ln[(1+ sinθ)/cosθ]), and then one shows after some work that the answer can be written in the closed‐form above.

A numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 0.0444317141.

We now output the final answer in the requested JSON format.
