We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln²(x + √(1+x²)) · ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) 

A key observation is that
  asinh(x) = ln(x+√(1+x²)).
Thus we may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [asinh(x)]² · ln ( (1+√(1–x²))/x ) dx .

One way to “attack” an integral like this is to try and “split” the logarithm in the second factor. In fact one may show (by, say, writing
  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = ln(1+√(1–x²)) – ln x)
and then “massaging” the resulting two integrals separately,
or by making a substitution x = cosθ so that
  √(1–x²)= sinθ  and  ln[(1+√(1–x²))/x] = ln((1+ sinθ)/cosθ),
one may reduce I to integrals that eventually can be evaluated in closed‐form in terms of dilogarithms and trilogarithms. (One may also introduce a parameter in one of the logarithms and differentiate under the integral sign.) Although the details are rather lengthy, one may show that an acceptable answer is

  I =  1/8 · [Li₃(1/2) – Li₃(–1/2)] – (ln2)/(8) · [Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2)] + (π)/(8) · ln³2 .

One may check (using, for example, the classical formulas
  Li₂(1/2)= π²/12 – (ln2)²/2  and  Li₂(–1/2)= –π²/24 – (ln2)²/2)
that this answer may be rearranged into an equivalent form. A short computation shows that numerically

  I ≈ 0.2650288841 .

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  I =  (1/8)[Li₃(1/2) – Li₃(–1/2)] – (ln2)/(8)[Li₂(1/2) – Li₂(–1/2)] + (π ln³2)/(8).

A complete solution would include all of the “hard‐work” that shows the substitutions and transformations that lead to the answer above. (Any answer equivalent to the answer given is correct.)
