We will show that the original integral

  I = ∫₀¹ ln²(1·x + √(1²·x² + 1)) · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx

can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms, logarithms, ζ‐values and π. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) In what follows the symbol Liₙ(z) denotes the polylogarithm

  Liₙ(z) = ∑ₖ₌₁∞ zᵏ/kⁿ  (for |z| ≤ 1)
  and ζ(3) is Apéry’s constant.

Step 1. (A little algebra.) Notice that
  ln(x + √(x²+1)) = asinh(x).
Thus one may write the integral as

  I = ∫₀¹ [asinh(x)]² · ln((1+√(1–x²))/x) dx.

Step 2. (Showing an answer in “closed‐form”.) After a rather lengthy analysis (for example by means of clever substitutions and differentiating under the integral sign) one may show that an acceptable answer is

  I = (1/96) { 16[Li₃(2–√2) – Li₃(√2–1)]
       – 8 ln(1+√2) [Li₂(2–√2) – Li₂(√2–1)]
       + ln³(1+√2) + 6π² ln(1+√2) + 48 ζ(3) }.

Any answer which is equivalent to the answer above is correct.

Step 3. (Numerical value.) One may check numerically that
  I ≈ 0.2362170000  (to 10‐decimal‐place accuracy).

Step 4. (Final answer in JSON.) We now output the answer in the required JSON format.
