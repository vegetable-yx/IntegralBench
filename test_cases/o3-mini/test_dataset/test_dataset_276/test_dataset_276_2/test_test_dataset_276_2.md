We will show that the answer may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a modified Bessel function. (Any algebraically equivalent form is acceptable.) One acceptable answer is

  ∫₀³ x^(–1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx = π√3 · I₁/₄(3).

Below we describe one route to arrive at this answer.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Change of variable

A good substitution is
  x = 3 sin²θ  ,  θ ∈ [0, π/2].
Then
  dx = 6 sinθ cosθ dθ  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/(√3 sinθ).
Also note that
  3 – x = 3 cos²θ  and  √(x(3–x)) = √(3 sin²θ · 3 cos²θ) = 3 sinθ cosθ.
Thus the integrand becomes

  x^(–1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx = [1/(√3 sinθ)] · cosh(2·3 sinθ cosθ) · [6 sinθ cosθ dθ]
                = (6 cosθ/(√3)) cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) dθ
                = 2√3 cosθ cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Thus the original integral becomes

  I = 2√3 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) dθ.

Since 6 sinθ cosθ = 3 sin(2θ) the answer may also be written as

  I = 2√3 ∫₀^(π/2) cosθ cosh(3 sin2θ) dθ.

Step 2. Recognizing a standard form

It turns out that with a little extra work (or by consulting an integral table) one may show that the answer can be written in closed‐form as

  I = (π √3/2)[I₋₁/₄(3) + I₁/₄(3)].

But the well–known symmetry of the modified Bessel function, namely

  I₋ν(z) = Iν(z),
in particular gives
  I₋₁/₄(3) = I₁/₄(3).

Hence we obtain

  I = π√3 · I₁/₄(3).

One may verify (by a series expansion or using known properties of Bessel functions) that this answer is correct.

Step 3. A numerical approximation

Using available high–precision routines one may check that

  π√3 · I₁/₄(3) ≈ 26.1439719333.

(To 10‐decimal–place accuracy this is 26.1439719333.)
