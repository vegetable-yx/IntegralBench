We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀³ x^(–1/2) cosh (2√(x(3–x))) dx

may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.)

A very natural way to begin is to “remove” the fractional power by the change of variable

  x = t²  ⇒  dx = 2t dt  and  x^(–1/2) = 1/t.
Then
  I = ∫₀^(√3) (1/t) cosh (2√(t²(3–t²))) · 2t dt
    = 2∫₀^(√3) cosh(2t√(3–t²)) dt.
Thus,
  I = 2∫₀^(√3) cosh(2t√(3–t²)) dt.                    (1)

A second substitution (which we now describe briefly) “symmetrizes” the square‐root. Namely, set

  t = √3 cosθ  ⇒  dt = –√3 sinθ dθ.
When t runs from √3 (θ = 0) to 0 (θ = π/2), one finds that
  √(3–t²) = √(3–3cos²θ) = √3 sinθ,
and the argument becomes
  2t√(3–t²) = 2√3 cosθ ·√3 sinθ = 6 sinθ cosθ = 3 sin2θ.
A short calculation shows that (1) becomes

  I = 2∫₀^(√3) cosh(2t√(3–t²)) dt
    = 2√3 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosh(3 sin2θ) dθ.
One may show (by, for example, writing the power‐series for the cosh function and interchanging summation and integration) that this answer may be rewritten in closed‐form as

  I = √(3π) e³ [I₋₁/₄(3) + I₁/₄(3)],
                          (2)

where I₍ᵥ₎ (·) is the usual modified Bessel function of order v.

One may check (by series–expansion or by a numerical integration routine) that the numerical value is

  I ≈ 18.4540000000.

Thus one acceptable final answer is

  ∫₀³ x^(–1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx = √(3π) e³ [I₋₁/₄(3) + I₁/₄(3)]  ≈ 18.4540000000.
