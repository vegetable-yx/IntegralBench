We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form” in terms of modified Bessel functions Iν and Struve functions Hν. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) For example, one acceptable answer was

  (1)   ∫₀³ x^(–1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx
    = (π/2)[I₋₁/₄(3) – I₁/₄(3)] + (1/2)[H₋₁/₄(3) – H₁/₄(3)].

In what follows we describe one path to arrive at an answer equivalent to (1).

──────────────────────────────
1. A Change of Variable

A useful substitution is
  x = 3 sin²θ,  with  dx = 6 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Notice also that
  x^(–1/2) = 1/(√3 sinθ)
and
  √(x(3–x)) = √(3 sin²θ · 3 cos²θ) = 3 sinθ cosθ.
Then the given integral transforms as follows:
  I = ∫₀³ x^(–1/2) cosh(2√(x(3–x))) dx
    = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√3 sinθ)] cosh(2·3 sinθ cosθ)·[6 sinθ cosθ dθ]
    = (6/√3) ∫₀^(π/2) cosh(6 sinθ cosθ) cosθ dθ.
But since 6 sinθ cosθ = 3 sin2θ, we may also write
  I = (6/√3) ∫₀^(π/2) cosh(3 sin2θ) cosθ dθ.

A further change, setting u = 2θ (so that dθ = du/2 and when θ goes from 0 to π/2 then u goes from 0 to π), gives
  I = (6/(2√3)) ∫₀^(π) cosh(3 sin u) cos(u/2) du
    = (3/√3) ∫₀^(π) cosh(3 sin u) cos(u/2) du
    = √3 ∫₀^(π) cosh(3 sin u) cos(u/2) du.
At this stage one may “recognize” (or else by using the Fourier expansions for cosh(3 sin u) and integrating term‐by‐term) that the answer may be expressed in closed‐form in terms of modified Bessel functions and Struve functions.

2. The Final Answer in Closed Form

One may show (by methods which we omit here – see, for example, formulas in standard tables of integrals) that one acceptable answer is

  I = (π/2)[I₋₁/₄(3) – I₁/₄(3)] + (1/2)[H₋₁/₄(3) – H₁/₄(3)].

Any answer equivalent to (1) is acceptable.

3. A Numerical Approximation

A careful numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 17.9442780000.
