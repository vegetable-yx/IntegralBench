We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ [ln(x + 1/x)]/(x + 1/x) dx.

A good first step is to rewrite the integrand. Notice that

  x + 1/x = (x² + 1)/x  and  ln(x + 1/x) = ln((x² + 1)/x) = ln(1 + x²) – ln x.

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₀¹ {ln(1 + x²) – ln x} / [(x² + 1)/x] dx
     = ∫₀¹ {x ln(1 + x²)/(1 + x²) – x ln x/(1 + x²)} dx.

That is, writing I = A – B with
  A = ∫₀¹ [x ln(1 + x²)]/(1 + x²) dx  and  B = ∫₀¹ [x ln x]/(1 + x²) dx.

Step 1. Evaluate A.

Make the substitution u = x² so that
  du = 2x dx  or  x dx = du/2.
When x ranges from 0 to 1, u runs from 0 to 1. Then

  A = ∫₀¹ [x ln(1 + x²)]/(1 + x²) dx = (1/2) ∫₀¹ [ln(1 + u)]/(1 + u) du.
Now, change variables again by setting v = 1 + u. Then dv = du and as u goes from 0 to 1, v goes from 1 to 2. Hence

  A = (1/2) ∫₁² (ln v)/v dv.
But we have
  ∫ (ln v)/v dv = (1/2) (ln v)² + C.
Thus

  A = (1/2) [ (1/2)(ln v)² ] from v = 1 to 2 = (1/4)[(ln 2)² – (ln 1)²].
Since ln 1 = 0, we obtain

  A = (1/4)(ln 2)².

Step 2. Evaluate B.

We have
  B = ∫₀¹ [x ln x]/(1 + x²) dx.
Again, substitute u = x² so that x dx = du/2 and note that ln x = (1/2) ln u. Then

  B = ∫₀¹ [x ln x]/(1 + x²) dx = ∫₀¹ [ (1/2) ln u ]/(1 + u) · (du/2)
        = (1/4) ∫₀¹ [ln u]/(1 + u) du.

Now, we evaluate

  I₁ = ∫₀¹ (ln u)/(1 + u) du.
A standard method is to use the power‐series expansion for 1/(1 + u):

  1/(1 + u) = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ uⁿ  (for |u| < 1, which is valid on [0, 1]).
Then
  I₁ = Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ ∫₀¹ uⁿ ln u du.
A standard integral is
  ∫₀¹ uⁿ ln u du = –1/(n + 1)².
Thus
  I₁ = – Σₙ₌₀∞ (–1)ⁿ/(n + 1)².
Changing index by m = n + 1 yields
  I₁ = – Σₘ₌₁∞ (–1)^(m–1)/m².
But the series Σₘ₌₁∞ (–1)^(m–1)/m² is known to equal π²/12. Hence,

  I₁ = –π²/12  and therefore  B = (1/4)(I₁) = –π²/48.

Step 3. Combine the results.

Recall I = A – B. Thus

  I = (1/4)(ln 2)² – (–π²/48) = (1/4)(ln 2)² + π²/48.

This is the exact answer.

Step 4. Numerical approximation.

We have:
  ln 2 ≈ 0.6931471805599453  ⟹  (ln 2)² ≈ 0.4804530139182014,
  (1/4)(ln 2)² ≈ 0.12011325347955035.
Also, π² ≈ 9.869604401089358  ⟹  π²/48 ≈ 0.205616758352695.
Therefore, the sum is approximately

  I ≈ 0.12011325348 + 0.20561675835 = 0.32573001183.

Rounded to 10 decimal places, I ≈ 0.3257300118.
