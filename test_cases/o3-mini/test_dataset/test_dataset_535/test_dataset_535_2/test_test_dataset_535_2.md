We start with the integral

  I = ∫₁^(eᵉ) [log(x^(log(xˣ)))] / x² dx.

Step 1. Simplify the integrand.
  Recall that for any positive numbers, log(a^(b)) = b · log(a). In our case, let
    x^(log(xˣ)) where log(xˣ) = x log x.
  Thus,
    log(x^(log(xˣ))) = log(x^(x log x)) = (x log x) · log x = x (log x)².
  The integrand then becomes
    [x (log x)²] / x² = (log x)² / x.

Step 2. Change of variable.
  Let u = log x so that du = dx/x.
  When x = 1, u = log 1 = 0.
  When x = eᵉ, u = log(eᵉ) = e.
  In terms of u, the integral transforms to:
    I = ∫₀^(e) u² du.

Step 3. Compute the integral.
  ∫ u² du = u³/3.
  Thus, evaluating between 0 and e yields:
    I = [u³/3]₀^(e) = e³/3.

Step 4. Numerical approximation.
  The numerical approximation for e is approximately 2.7182818285.
  Then e³ is approximately 20.0855369232, so
    I ≈ 20.0855369232 / 3 ≈ 6.6951789744.
