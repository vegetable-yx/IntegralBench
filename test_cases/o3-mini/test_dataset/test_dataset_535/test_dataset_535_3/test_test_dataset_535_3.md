First note that
  log(x^(log(x^x))) = log(x^(x log x)) = (x log x) · log x = x (log x)².
Thus, the integral becomes

  I = ∫₁^(e^e) [x (log x)²] / x² dx = ∫₁^(e^e) (log x)²/x dx.

Now, let u = log x. Then, du = dx/x, and the limits transform as:
  when x = 1, u = log 1 = 0;
  when x = e^e, u = log(e^e) = e.

Thus, the integral is rewritten as

  I = ∫₀^e u² du.

Integrate:

  ∫₀^e u² du = [u³/3]₀^e = e³/3.

So the exact answer is e³/3.

For a numerical approximation,
  e³ ≈ 20.085536923187667,
  therefore, I ≈ 20.085536923187667/3 ≈ 6.6951789744.
