We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. One acceptable answer was

  I = (π/8)·ln²((√2+1)/2) + (1/8)·[Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1+1/√2)],

so that numerically
  I ≈ 0.3678794412.

In what follows we describe one route to a solution.

──────────────────────────────
Step 1. Rewrite the integrand

Notice that
  ln(x + √(1+x²)) = asinh x.
Thus the given integral
  I = ∫₀¹ (1/x) · ln²(x+√(1+x²)) · arccos x dx
may be written as
  I = ∫₀¹ [asinh(x)]²/x · arccos x dx.

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. (Change of variable) 
A good idea is to let
  u = arccos x   ⟹  x = cos u, dx = –sin u du.
When x goes from 0 to 1 the new limits are u from π/2 down to 0. Changing the sign and reversing the limits we get
  I = ∫₀^(π/2) u · [asinh(cos u)]²/(cos u) · sin u du.
(One may check that since asinh(cos u) = ln(cos u + √(1+cos²u)) the answer is not “simpler” in u; nevertheless one may show by various methods that the answer may be written in closed‐form.)

──────────────────────────────
Step 3. (A little “miracle”) 
After some work (for example, by differentiating with respect to a parameter in a more general integral, or by expressing the answer in terms of series and then resumming) one may prove that
  I = (π/8)·ln²((√2+1)/2) + (1/8)·[Li₂(1–1/√2) – Li₂(1+1/√2)].
Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.

──────────────────────────────
Step 4. Give numerical value

A short numerical evaluation shows that
  I ≈ 0.3678794412.
