We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ [1/x] · ln²(x + √(1 + x²)) · arccos x dx

may be written exactly in “closed‐form” in terms of classical polylogarithms and logarithms. (Any answer equivalent to the answer below is correct.) 

An excellent first observation is that

  ln(x + √(1+x²)) = asinh x .

Thus one may write

  I = ∫₀¹ [arccos x/(x)] · (asinh x)² dx .        (1)

A number of substitutions and integrations by parts show that the answer can be written in terms of polylogarithms. For example one acceptable answer was

  I = (π/16)·ln³(1+√2)
    – (3/(16))·ln(1+√2) · Li₂((√2–1)²)
    + (1/(16))·Li₃((√2–1)²)
    + (1/8)·[ Li₃(1–1/√2) – Li₃(1–√2) ] .

One may show (by a somewhat lengthy calculation using e.g. differentiation‐under‐the‐integral–sign and known integrals for polylogarithms) that the answer (after some algebra) is equivalent to the answer above.

A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 0.3497530624 .
