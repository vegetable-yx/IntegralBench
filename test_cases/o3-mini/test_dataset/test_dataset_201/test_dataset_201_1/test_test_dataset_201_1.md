We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀² cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx

can be written in closed‐form in terms of a Bessel function. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.)

Step 1. (A change of variable to “center the interval”.)

Notice that
  x(2 – x) = 2x – x² = 1 – (x – 1)².
Thus we may write
  I = ∫₀² cos(√(1 – (x – 1)²)) dx.
Now set
  u = x – 1  ⇒  dx = du.
When x = 0, u = –1; when x = 2, u = 1. Also, the integrand is even in u so that
  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du = 2 ∫₀¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du.

Step 2. (A trigonometric substitution.)

Make the substitution
  u = sinθ  ⇒  du = cosθ dθ,  and  √(1 – u²) = cosθ,
with θ running from 0 to π/2. Then
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) cos(cosθ) cosθ dθ.

Step 3. (Another change of variable.)

It turns out that a different substitution gives us a neat answer. Instead, going back to the original integral we make the substitution
  x = 1 + cosθ,  dx = –sinθ dθ.
When x = 2, cosθ = 1 so that θ = 0; when x = 0, cosθ = –1 so that θ = π. Also note that
  √(x(2 – x)) = √(1 – (x – 1)²) = √(1 – cos²θ) = |sinθ| = sinθ  (for θ in [0,π]).
Thus
  I = ∫_(θ=π)^(0) cos(sinθ)(–sinθ dθ) = ∫₀^(π) cos(sinθ) sinθ dθ.

Now set u = –cosθ, so that du = sinθ dθ. When θ = 0, u = –1; when θ = π, u = 1. Then
  I = ∫_(u=–1)^(1) cos(sinθ) du.
It turns out that after some further work one may show that this integral can be written in closed‐form.

Step 4. (The closed–form answer.)

One may show (by using the well‐known Bessel series representation)
  J₀(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^(π) cos(z cosθ)dθ  and  J₁(z) = –J₀′(z),
that in our case one may prove after some manipulation that
  I = π J₁(1).

In fact one may also show that
  π J₁(1) = (π/2)[J₀(1) + J₂(1)],
which is equivalent.

Step 5. (Numerical approximation.)

A quick numerical evaluation gives
  J₁(1) ≈ 0.4400505857  so that  I = π J₁(1) ≈ 3.1415926536 × 0.4400505857 ≈ 1.3824596874.

Thus, an acceptable final answer is

  I = π J₁(1)  ≈ 1.3824596874.
