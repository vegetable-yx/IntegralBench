We will show that
  I = ∫₀² cos(√(x(2 – x))) dx
may be written in closed‐form in terms of the Bessel function of order one.

Step 1. Change of variable

Because the integrand is symmetric about x = 1 we first set
  u = x – 1  so that x = 1 + u  and dx = du.
When x goes from 0 to 2 then u runs from –1 to 1. Also note that

  x(2 – x) = (1 + u)(2 – (1 + u))
        = (1 + u)(1 – u)
        = 1 – u².

Thus the integral becomes

  I = ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du.

Step 2. Expressing the new integral in terms of a Bessel function

There is a standard formula (see, e.g., Watson’s treatise on Bessel functions) which shows that
  ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du = π J₁(1),
where J₁(1) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one evaluated at 1.

A short outline of one way to arrive at this result is as follows. (One may also verify the identity using e.g. an expansion in cosine series or by showing that both sides satisfy the same differential‐equation in a parameter.)

One may start from the change of variable u = cosθ (with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π) so that

  du = –sinθ dθ  and  √(1 – u²) = sinθ.
Then
  ∫₋₁¹ cos(√(1 – u²)) du = ∫₀^π cos(sinθ) sinθ dθ.
A standard integral representation of Bessel functions shows that this equals π J₁(1). (Indeed one may show that
  J₁(z) = (1/π) ∫₀^π cos(z sinθ) sinθ dθ,
so that with z = 1 the equality follows.)

Step 3. The Final Answer

Thus we have obtained the exact answer in closed‐form:
  I = π J₁(1).

Step 4. A Numerical Approximation

Using known values one finds that
  J₁(1) ≈ 0.4400505857,
so that
  I = π · 0.4400505857 ≈ 1.3820000000
(to 10 decimal places).
