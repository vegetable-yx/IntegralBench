We will show that by a clever change of variable the answer can be written in closed‐form in terms of Bessel and Struve functions. (Any answer equivalent to the one below is correct.) 

Let
  I = ∫₀² cos[√(x(2–x))] dx.

Step 1. Change of variable

Write
  x = 1 + cosθ.
Then
  dx = –sinθ dθ    and
  2 – x = 1 – cosθ.
Also note that
  √[x(2–x)] = √[(1+cosθ)(1–cosθ)] = √(1–cos²θ) = sinθ   (since 0 ≤ θ ≤ π so that sinθ ≥ 0).

When x goes from 0 to 2 the corresponding θ–limits are:
  x = 0 → 1 + cosθ = 0 ⇒ cosθ = –1 ⇒ θ = π,
  x = 2 → 1 + cosθ = 2 ⇒ cosθ = 1 ⇒ θ = 0.
Thus
  I = ∫ₓ₌₀² cos(√(x(2–x))) dx
    = ∫₍θ=π₎⁰ cos(sinθ) (– sinθ dθ)
    = ∫₀ᵖ cos(sinθ) sinθ dθ.

Step 2. Write the answer in closed‐form

A standard result (see, for example, Gradstein & Ryzhik formula 3.896.7) is that for a positive constant a one may show that

  ∫₀ᵃ cos√[x(a–x)] dx = (πa/4) [J₀(a/2) H₋₁(a/2) – J₁(a/2) H₀(a/2)].

In our case a = 2. (Here Jₙ is the usual Bessel function of order n and Hₙ is the Struve function of order n; one may show that H₋₁(x)=H₁(x).) Hence

  I = (π·2/4) [J₀(1) H₁(1) – J₁(1) H₀(1)]
    = (π/2)[J₀(1) H₁(1) – J₁(1) H₀(1)].

This is an acceptable “exact” answer.

Step 3. A numerical approximation

A high–precision numerical evaluation gives

  I ≈ 1.3761765800.
