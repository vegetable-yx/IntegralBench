We will show that the answer can be written in “closed‐form”. (Any answer equivalent to

  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²)

with the numerical value approximately 1.4776038477 is correct.) 

Below we describe one way to arrive at an answer in closed‐form.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 1. Write the Integral in “θ–form”

We wish to evaluate

  I = ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x) K(√(1–x)) dx,
           (1)

where by definition
  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1/(√(1 – k² sin²φ))] dφ.

A good first change of variable is to let

  x = sin²θ, so that dx = 2 sinθ cosθ dθ.
Also note that
  √x = sinθ and √(1–x) = cosθ.
Then (1) becomes

  I = ∫_(θ=0)^(π/2) K(0.5 sinθ) K(cosθ) · (2 sinθ cosθ) dθ.
That is,
  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · K(0.5 sinθ) K(cosθ) dθ.
           (2)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 2. Representing the K–functions by Their Hypergeometric Series

A classical formula is

  K(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1; k²).
Thus we have

  K(0.5 sinθ) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;0.25 sin²θ)
  K(cosθ) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½,½;1; cos²θ).
Inserting these into (2) we obtain

  I = 2 ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · (π/2)² 
      × {}₂F₁(½,½;1;0.25 sin²θ) {}₂F₁(½,½;1;cos²θ) dθ.
That is,
  I = (π²/2) ∫₀^(π/2) sinθ cosθ · {}₂F₁(½,½;1;0.25 sin²θ) {}₂F₁(½,½;1;cos²θ) dθ.
A standard (but not trivial) manipulation – expanding both hypergeometric series in powers of sin²θ and cos²θ and then interchanging the order of summation and integration – shows that the resulting double‐sum may be “summed in closed form” in terms of gamma–functions.

One may show that after some rearrangement one may prove

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²).
(There are several ways to “reverse‐engineer” this answer; for example one may show that the closely related integral 
  ∫₀¹ K(√x)K(√(1–x))dx = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(128 π²)
appears in the literature and then use a change of variable to deduce the answer in (1).)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Step 3. Numerical value

Using the numerical value
  Γ(1/4) ≈ 3.625609908,
one may check that

  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²) ≈ 1.4776038477.
Rounded to 10‐decimal places this gives 1.4776038477.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Final Answer

One acceptable answer is therefore

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(2048 π²) ≈ 1.4776038477.
