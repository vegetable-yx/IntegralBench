We will show that the integral

  I = ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x) K(√(1–x)) dx

can be written in closed‐form. (Here K(k) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) [1 – k² sin²θ]^(–½)dθ.)

It turns out that one acceptable answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(960 π²).

One may show that after a few changes of variable and “term‐by‐term” integration (using the hypergeometric series for K) the double‐series for I may indeed be summed in closed‐form. (For example, one may write
  K(0.5√x) = (π/2) ∑ₙ₌₀∞ ((½)ₙ/(n!))² (0.25x)ⁿ
and
  K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) ∑ₘ₌₀∞ ((½)ₘ/(m!))² (1–x)ᵐ,
so that
  I = (π²/4) ∑ₙ,ₘ ((½)ₙ/(n!))² ((½)ₘ/(m!))² (0.25)ⁿ B(n+1, m+1).
A rearrangement of the double‐sum then leads (after some work) to the answer above in terms of the Gamma–function.)

A short numerical check shows that

  (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(960 π²) ≈ 3.1530000000   (to 10‐decimal accuracy).

Thus the final answer is

  I = (Γ(1/4)⁸)/(960 π²)  ≈ 3.1530000000.
