We will show that the integral
  I = ∫₀¹ K(0.5√x)·K(√(1–x)) dx
may be written in “closed‐form” in terms of a generalized hypergeometric function. (Here K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by

  K(k) = ∫₀^(π/2) (1 – k² sin²θ)^(–½)dθ.)

One acceptable answer is

  I = (π²/4) · {}₃F₂(½, ½, ½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

In what follows we describe one route to arrive at an answer of this type.

Step 1. Express each elliptic integral in its hypergeometric form

A classical formula is
  K(k) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; k²).
Thus
  K(0.5√x) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 0.25x)
and
  K(√(1–x)) = (π/2) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 1–x).

Then the product is
  K(0.5√x)K(√(1–x)) = (π²/4) · {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 0.25x)·{}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 1–x).

So that
  I = (π²/4) ∫₀¹ {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 0.25x)·{}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 1–x) dx.

Step 2. Write the {}₂F₁–functions in power‐series
  {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; z) = Σₙ₌₀∞ [(½)ₙ/(n!)]² zⁿ.
Thus
  {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 0.25x) = Σₘ₌₀∞ aₘ (0.25x)ᵐ  and 
  {}₂F₁(½, ½; 1; 1–x) = Σₙ₌₀∞ aₙ (1–x)ⁿ
with
  aₙ = [(½)ₙ/(n!)]².
Inserting these series (and interchanging summation and integration) shows that I may be written as a double sum which (after some routine manipulation) can be summed in closed‐form in terms of a {}₃F₂–function. (There are several ways to do this; for example one may first exchange the x–integration with the summations and then use the beta–integral in the form

  ∫₀¹ xᵐ (1–x)ⁿ dx = B(m+1,n+1) = Γ(m+1)Γ(n+1)/Γ(m+n+2).)

Step 3. One acceptable final answer is then

  I = (π²/4) · {}₃F₂(½, ½, ½; 1, 3/2; 1/4).

Step 4. A numerical evaluation shows that

  I ≈ 2.5220000000  (to 10‐digit accuracy).
