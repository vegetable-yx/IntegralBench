To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx\) does not have a straightforward antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, we will use a known result from integral tables or special functions.

The integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx\) can be expressed in terms of the Bessel function of the first kind, \(J_0\). Specifically, we have:

\[
\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx = \pi J_0(1)
\]

where \(J_0\) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 0.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To find the numerical value of \(\pi J_0(1)\), we use the known value of \(J_0(1)\):

\[
J_0(1) \approx 0.7651976865579666
\]

Thus,

\[
\pi J_0(1) \approx \pi \times 0.7651976865579666 \approx 2.404825557695773
\]
