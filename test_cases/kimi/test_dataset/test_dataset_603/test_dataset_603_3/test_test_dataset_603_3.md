To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(x)}} \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand

First, observe that \(1 - \sin^2(x) = \cos^2(x)\). Therefore, the integrand can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{\cos^2(x)}} = \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|}
\]

Since \(\cos(x)\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\) and symmetric around \(\pi\), we can split the integral into two parts:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|} \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Further simplification

For \(x \in [0, \pi]\), \(\cos(x) \geq 0\), so \(|\cos(x)| = \cos(x)\). Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
2 \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Use a trigonometric identity

We use the identity \(1 + \cos(x) = 2 \cos^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\):
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} = \frac{1}{2 \cos^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{2} \sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
2 \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} \sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \, dx
\]

### Step 4: Change of variable

Let \(u = \frac{x}{2}\). Then \(du = \frac{1}{2} dx\), and the limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(u = 0\) and from \(x = \pi\) to \(u = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^{\pi} \sec^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sec^2(u) \, du
\]

### Step 5: Evaluate the integral

The integral of \(\sec^2(u)\) is \(\tan(u)\):
\[
2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sec^2(u) \, du = 2 \left[ \tan(u) \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = 2 \left( \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \tan(0) \right)
\]

Since \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) is undefined, we need to handle this carefully. However, the integral is improper and diverges at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the integral does not converge in the usual sense.

### Numerical Approximation

Given the divergence, we cannot provide a numerical approximation for the integral as it does not converge.

### Final Answer

Since the integral diverges, we cannot provide a finite exact answer or a numerical approximation. The integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(x)}} \, dx\) does not converge.

\[
\boxed{\text{The integral diverges.}}
\]

However, if we were to follow the format strictly, we would output:

{"answer": "\\text{The integral diverges.}", "numerical_answer": "N/A"}
