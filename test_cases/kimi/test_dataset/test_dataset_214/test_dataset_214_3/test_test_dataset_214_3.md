To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} \cos\left(1 \cdot \sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

First, let's rewrite the integral for clarity:
\[ I = \int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2} \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx. \]

To simplify this integral, we use a substitution. Let:
\[ t = \sqrt{x(2 - x)}. \]

Then:
\[ t^2 = x(2 - x). \]

Differentiating both sides with respect to \(x\):
\[ 2t \, dt = (2 - 2x) \, dx. \]
\[ dx = \frac{2t \, dt}{2(1 - x)}. \]

We also need to express \(x\) in terms of \(t\). From \(t^2 = x(2 - x)\), we solve for \(x\):
\[ t^2 = 2x - x^2. \]
\[ x^2 - 2x + t^2 = 0. \]
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4t^2}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2}. \]

Since \(x\) ranges from 0 to 2, we choose the appropriate root:
\[ x = 1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}. \]

Now, substituting \(x = 1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}\) into the integral:
\[ dx = \frac{2t \, dt}{2(1 - (1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}))} = \frac{2t \, dt}{2\sqrt{1 - t^2}} = \frac{t \, dt}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}}. \]

The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(t = \sqrt{0 \cdot 2} = 0\).
- When \(x = 2\), \(t = \sqrt{2 \cdot 0} = 0\).

However, this substitution does not simplify the integral directly. Instead, we recognize that the integral is a form of a known integral involving Bessel functions. Specifically, it can be related to the integral representation of the Bessel function of the first kind \(J_0\):
\[ \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos(a \sin \theta) \, d\theta = \pi J_0(a). \]

By comparing, we see that our integral is a special case of this form. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:
\[ I = \pi J_0(1). \]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

Using the known value of the Bessel function \(J_0(1)\):
\[ J_0(1) \approx 0.7651976865579666. \]

Thus, the numerical approximation of the integral is:
\[ I \approx \pi \cdot 0.7651976865579666 \approx 2.402765035409747. \]

### Step 3: Final Answer in JSON Format

The exact answer in LaTeX is:
\[ \pi J_0(1). \]

The numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is:
\[ 2.4027650354. \]

Therefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:
```json
{"answer": "\\pi J_0(1)", "numerical_answer": "2.4027650354"}
