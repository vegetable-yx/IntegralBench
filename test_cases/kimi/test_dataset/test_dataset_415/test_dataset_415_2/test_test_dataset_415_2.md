To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we need to understand the behavior of the fractional part function. The fractional part of \(x\), \(\{x\}\), is defined as \(x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Fractional Part Function:**
   The fractional part function \(\{x\}\) repeats every integer interval. Specifically, for \(x\) in the interval \([n, n+1)\), where \(n\) is an integer, \(\{x\} = x - n\).

2. **Breaking the Integral into Intervals:**
   We can break the integral from 0 to 4 into four intervals: \([0, 1)\), \([1, 2)\), \([2, 3)\), and \([3, 4)\).

3. **Evaluating the Integral in Each Interval:**
   For each interval \([n, n+1)\), \(\{x\} = x - n\). Therefore, the integral over each interval can be written as:
   \[
   \int_n^{n+1} (x - n)^4 \, dx
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Integral:**
   Let \(u = x - n\). Then \(du = dx\), and the limits of integration change from \(n\) to \(n+1\) to \(0\) to \(1\). Thus, the integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_0^1 u^4 \, du
   \]

5. **Computing the Integral:**
   The integral of \(u^4\) from 0 to 1 is:
   \[
   \int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left[ \frac{u^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1^5}{5} - \frac{0^5}{5} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

6. **Summing the Integrals:**
   Since the integral over each interval \([n, n+1)\) is \(\frac{1}{5}\), and there are four such intervals from 0 to 4, the total integral is:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

### Numerical Approximation:
The numerical approximation of \(\frac{4}{5}\) is:
\[
0.8000000000
\]
