To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\), where \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), we need to understand the behavior of the fractional part function. The fractional part of \(x\), \(\{x\}\), is defined as \(x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

The function \(\{x\}\) is periodic with period 1, meaning \(\{x + 1\} = \{x\}\). Therefore, we can break the integral into intervals of length 1 and sum the results.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Break the integral into intervals of length 1:**
   \[
   \int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 \{x\}^4 \, dx + \int_1^2 \{x\}^4 \, dx + \int_2^3 \{x\}^4 \, dx + \int_3^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx
   \]

2. **Evaluate each integral separately:**
   Since \(\{x\} = x\) for \(x \in [0, 1)\), \(\{x\} = x - 1\) for \(x \in [1, 2)\), \(\{x\} = x - 2\) for \(x \in [2, 3)\), and \(\{x\} = x - 3\) for \(x \in [3, 4)\), we can write:
   \[
   \int_0^1 x^4 \, dx + \int_1^2 (x - 1)^4 \, dx + \int_2^3 (x - 2)^4 \, dx + \int_3^4 (x - 3)^4 \, dx
   \]

3. **Compute each integral:**
   - For \(\int_0^1 x^4 \, dx\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 x^4 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

   - For \(\int_1^2 (x - 1)^4 \, dx\):
     Let \(u = x - 1\), then \(du = dx\) and the limits change from \(x = 1\) to \(u = 0\) and from \(x = 2\) to \(u = 1\):
     \[
     \int_1^2 (x - 1)^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left[ \frac{u^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

   - For \(\int_2^3 (x - 2)^4 \, dx\):
     Let \(u = x - 2\), then \(du = dx\) and the limits change from \(x = 2\) to \(u = 0\) and from \(x = 3\) to \(u = 1\):
     \[
     \int_2^3 (x - 2)^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left[ \frac{u^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

   - For \(\int_3^4 (x - 3)^4 \, dx\):
     Let \(u = x - 3\), then \(du = dx\) and the limits change from \(x = 3\) to \(u = 0\) and from \(x = 4\) to \(u = 1\):
     \[
     \int_3^4 (x - 3)^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 u^4 \, du = \left[ \frac{u^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

4. **Sum the results:**
   \[
   \int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]
