To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the nested absolute value expressions and break down the integral into simpler parts.

### Step 1: Simplify the Innermost Absolute Value

First, consider the innermost absolute value \(|1 - x|\). This expression can be split into two cases based on the value of \(x\):

- For \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), \(|1 - x| = 1 - x\).

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 |1 - |1 - (1 - x)|| \, dx = \int_0^1 |1 - |x|| \, dx
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Next Absolute Value

Next, consider \(|x|\). Since \(x\) is in the interval \([0, 1]\), \(|x| = x\). Therefore, the integral further simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 |1 - x| \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Split the Integral Based on the Absolute Value

The expression \(|1 - x|\) can be split into two cases:

- For \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), \(|1 - x| = 1 - x\).

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 (1 - x) \, dx
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Integral

Now, we can compute the integral:
\[
\int_0^1 (1 - x) \, dx = \int_0^1 1 \, dx - \int_0^1 x \, dx
\]

Evaluate each part separately:
\[
\int_0^1 1 \, dx = x \Big|_0^1 = 1 - 0 = 1
\]
\[
\int_0^1 x \, dx = \frac{x^2}{2} \Big|_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Subtract the second integral from the first:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation

The exact answer is \(\frac{1}{2}\). The numerical approximation of \(\frac{1}{2}\) to 10 decimal places is:
\[
0.5000000000
\]
