To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx\), we need to break it down into manageable parts. Here, \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), which is \(x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

First, observe that the integrand \(e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\}\) is an even function because \(e^{|x|}\) is even and \(\{x\}\) is periodic with period 1. Therefore, we can simplify the integral by considering the interval from 0 to 4 and then doubling the result:

\[
\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx = 2 \int_0^4 e^x \cdot \{x\} \, dx
\]

Next, we need to handle the fractional part \(\{x\}\). For \(x\) in the interval \([0, 4]\), \(\{x\}\) can be written as:

\[
\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]

We can split the integral into intervals where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is constant:

\[
\int_0^4 e^x \cdot \{x\} \, dx = \sum_{k=0}^3 \int_k^{k+1} e^x (x - k) \, dx
\]

Now, we compute each integral separately:

\[
\int_k^{k+1} e^x (x - k) \, dx
\]

Let \(u = x - k\), then \(du = dx\) and the limits change from \(k\) to \(k+1\) to \(0\) to \(1\):

\[
\int_k^{k+1} e^x (x - k) \, dx = \int_0^1 e^{u+k} u \, du = e^k \int_0^1 e^u u \, du
\]

The integral \(\int_0^1 e^u u \, du\) can be computed using integration by parts. Let \(v = u\) and \(dw = e^u du\), then \(dv = du\) and \(w = e^u\):

\[
\int_0^1 e^u u \, du = \left[ u e^u \right]_0^1 - \int_0^1 e^u \, du = e - \left[ e^u \right]_0^1 = e - (e - 1) = 1
\]

Thus,

\[
\int_k^{k+1} e^x (x - k) \, dx = e^k \cdot 1 = e^k
\]

Summing these integrals from \(k = 0\) to \(3\):

\[
\sum_{k=0}^3 e^k = e^0 + e^1 + e^2 + e^3 = 1 + e + e^2 + e^3
\]

Therefore,

\[
\int_0^4 e^x \cdot \{x\} \, dx = 1 + e + e^2 + e^3
\]

And the original integral is:

\[
\int_{-4}^4 e^{|x|} \cdot \{x\} \, dx = 2 (1 + e + e^2 + e^3)
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To find the numerical approximation, we compute:

\[
2 (1 + e + e^2 + e^3) \approx 2 (1 + 2.718281828 + 7.389056099 + 20.08553692) \approx 2 \times 31.19287485 \approx 62.3857497
\]
