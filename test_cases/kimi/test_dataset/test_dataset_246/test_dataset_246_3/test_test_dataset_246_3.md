To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we need to use some properties of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\).

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integral \(\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx\) involves the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind. This type of integral can be approached using known results from the theory of Bessel functions and their integrals.

One useful result is the integral representation of the product of Bessel functions. However, for higher powers like \(K_0^4(x)\), we often need to use more advanced techniques or known results from the literature.

A known result for integrals involving powers of \(K_0(x)\) is:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^{2n+1} K_0^{2m}(x) \, dx = \frac{(2m)!}{2^{2m} (m!)^2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2n+1} \Gamma(n+1)
\]
for \(m = 2\) and \(n = 3\).

### Step 2: Applying the Known Result

For our specific case, we have \(n = 3\) and \(m = 2\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{(2 \cdot 2)!}{2^{2 \cdot 2} (2!)^2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2 \cdot 3 + 1} \Gamma(3+1)
\]

Simplifying the constants:
\[
(2 \cdot 2)! = 4! = 24
\]
\[
2^{2 \cdot 2} = 2^4 = 16
\]
\[
(2!)^2 = 4
\]
\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{2 \cdot 3 + 1} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^7 = \frac{1}{128}
\]
\[
\Gamma(4) = 3! = 6
\]

Putting it all together:
\[
\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{24}{16 \cdot 4} \cdot \frac{1}{128} \cdot 6
\]

Simplifying further:
\[
\frac{24}{64} \cdot \frac{1}{128} \cdot 6 = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{128} \cdot 6 = \frac{3 \cdot 6}{8 \cdot 128} = \frac{18}{1024} = \frac{9}{512}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

The numerical approximation of \(\frac{9}{512}\) is:
\[
\frac{9}{512} \approx 0.017578125
\]
