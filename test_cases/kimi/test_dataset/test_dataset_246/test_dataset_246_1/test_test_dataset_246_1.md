To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we need to use some properties of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, \(K_0(x)\).

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integral \(\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx\) involves the fourth power of the modified Bessel function of the second kind. This type of integral can be evaluated using known results from the theory of Bessel functions and their integrals.

One useful result is the integral representation of the product of Bessel functions. For the specific case of \(K_0^4(x)\), we can use the following known result:

\[
\int_0^\infty x^{2n+1} K_0^{2m}(x) \, dx = \frac{(2m-1)!!}{2^{2m}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+m+1)}
\]

where \(n\) and \(m\) are non-negative integers, and \((2m-1)!!\) denotes the double factorial of \(2m-1\).

For our integral, \(n = 3\) and \(m = 2\):

\[
\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{(2 \cdot 2 - 1)!!}{2^{2 \cdot 2}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma(3+1)}{\Gamma(3+2+1)}
\]

Simplifying the double factorial and the Gamma functions:

\[
(2 \cdot 2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 \cdot 1 = 3
\]

\[
2^{2 \cdot 2} = 2^4 = 16
\]

\[
\Gamma(4) = 3! = 6
\]

\[
\Gamma(6) = 5! = 120
\]

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx = \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{6}{120} = \frac{3}{16} \cdot \frac{1}{20} = \frac{3}{320}
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To provide a numerical approximation of the result, we convert \(\frac{3}{320}\) to a decimal:

\[
\frac{3}{320} \approx 0.009375
\]

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is:

\[
0.009375000000
\]

### Step 3: JSON Output

Finally, we output the result in the specified JSON format:

```json
{"answer": "\\frac{3}{320}", "numerical_answer": "0.009375000000"}
