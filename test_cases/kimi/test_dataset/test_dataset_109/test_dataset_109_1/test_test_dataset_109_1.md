To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1} x^{-1/2} \operatorname{E}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and use appropriate techniques to evaluate it.

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integrand involves the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, \(\operatorname{E}(k)\), which is defined as:
\[
\operatorname{E}(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta
\]
where \(k\) is the elliptic modulus.

In our integral, \(k = \sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\). This makes the integral quite complex to solve directly. However, we can use a known result involving elliptic integrals and special functions.

### Step 2: Simplification and Known Results

The integral \(\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \operatorname{E}(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}) \, dx\) can be related to a known result involving the Beta function and elliptic integrals. Specifically, we can use the following identity:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{a-1} (1-x)^{b-1} \operatorname{E}(\sqrt{x}) \, dx = \frac{2^{a+b-2} \Gamma(a) \Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)} \left[ \operatorname{E}(1) - \frac{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)} \right]
\]
where \(\Gamma\) is the Gamma function.

For our specific case, \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{1}{2}\). This simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \operatorname{E}(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}) \, dx = \frac{2^{0} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(1)} \left[ \operatorname{E}(1) - \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma(1)} \right]
\]

Since \(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\pi}\) and \(\Gamma(1) = 1\), we have:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \operatorname{E}(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}) \, dx = \pi \left[ \operatorname{E}(1) - \pi \right]
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

The complete elliptic integral of the second kind \(\operatorname{E}(1)\) is known to be:
\[
\operatorname{E}(1) = 1
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} \operatorname{E}(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}) \, dx = \pi (1 - \pi)
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer in JSON Format

The exact answer in LaTeX format is:
\[
\pi (1 - \pi)
\]

The numerical approximation of \(\pi (1 - \pi)\) rounded to 10 decimal places is:
\[
\pi (1 - \pi) \approx 3.1415926536 \times (1 - 3.1415926536) \approx 3.1415926536 \times (-2.1415926536) \approx -6.7274999999
\]

Thus, the final answer in JSON format is:
```json
{"answer": "\\pi (1 - \\pi)", "numerical_answer": "-6.7274999999"}
