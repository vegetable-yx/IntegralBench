To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^{2.0} x^{1/2}(2.0 - x)^{1/2} \cos\left(1.0 \sqrt{x(2.0 - x)}\right) dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

First, let's simplify the integral by making a substitution. Let:
\[ t = \sqrt{x(2.0 - x)} \]

Then:
\[ t^2 = x(2.0 - x) \]
\[ t^2 = 2x - x^2 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x + t^2 = 0 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4t^2}}{2} \]
\[ x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2} \]

Since \(x\) ranges from 0 to 2, we choose the appropriate branch:
\[ x = 1 + \sqrt{1 - t^2} \]

Now, we need to find \(dx\) in terms of \(dt\):
\[ dx = \frac{d}{dt} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) dt \]
\[ dx = \frac{-t}{\sqrt{1 - t^2}} dt \]

The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \(x = 0\), \(t = \sqrt{0 \cdot 2} = 0\)
- When \(x = 2\), \(t = \sqrt{2 \cdot 0} = 0\)

However, this substitution does not simplify the integral directly. Instead, we recognize that the integral involves a product of a square root and a cosine function, which suggests a more complex form. Given the complexity, we will proceed to a numerical approximation.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

Using numerical integration methods (such as Simpson's rule, Gaussian quadrature, or a numerical integration tool), we can approximate the integral. For simplicity, we will use a numerical integration tool to find the value.

Using a numerical integration tool (such as Python's `scipy.integrate.quad`), we get:

```python
from scipy.integrate import quad
import numpy as np

def integrand(x):
    return x**0.5 * (2.0 - x)**0.5 * np.cos(np.sqrt(x * (2.0 - x)))

result, error = quad(integrand, 0, 2.0)
print(result)
```

Running this code, we obtain the numerical approximation of the integral.

### Step 3: Numerical Result

The numerical approximation of the integral is approximately:
