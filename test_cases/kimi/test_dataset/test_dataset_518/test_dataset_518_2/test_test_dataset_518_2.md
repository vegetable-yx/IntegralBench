To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the integrand \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\).

### Step 1: Analyze the integrand
The function \(\sin(2018x)\) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\). The absolute value \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) will be non-negative and will have the same period. Within each period, \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) will be symmetric around the midpoint of the period.

### Step 2: Break the integral into smaller intervals
Since the period of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\), we can break the integral into \(2018\) intervals of length \(\pi\):

\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \sum_{k=0}^{2017} \int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the integral over one period
Consider the integral over one period \(\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\). Since \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is periodic with period \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\), we can simplify this to:

\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the integral over one period
To evaluate \(\int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\), we note that \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is symmetric and positive over \([0, \pi]\). We can use the fact that the integral of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) over one period is twice the integral over half a period:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(2018x) \, dx
\]

### Step 5: Compute the integral
Now, we compute the integral:

\[
2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(2018x) \, dx = 2 \left[ -\frac{\cos(2018x)}{2018} \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{\cos(1009\pi)}{2018} + \frac{\cos(0)}{2018} \right)
\]

Since \(\cos(1009\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1\) and \(\cos(0) = 1\):

\[
2 \left( -\frac{-1}{2018} + \frac{1}{2018} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2018} + \frac{1}{2018} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{2018} = \frac{4}{2018} = \frac{2}{1009}
\]

### Step 6: Sum the integrals over all periods
Since there are \(2018\) such intervals:

\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = 2018 \cdot \frac{2}{1009} = 4
\]

### Step 7: Numerical approximation
The numerical approximation of \(4\) to 10 decimal places is \(4.0000000000\).
