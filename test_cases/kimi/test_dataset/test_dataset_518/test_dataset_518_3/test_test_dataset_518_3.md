To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the integrand \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\).

### Step 1: Analyze the integrand
The function \(\sin(2018x)\) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\). The absolute value \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) will thus oscillate between 0 and 1 with the same period.

### Step 2: Break the integral into smaller intervals
Since the period of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\), we can break the integral into \(2018\) intervals of length \(\pi\):

\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \sum_{k=0}^{2017} \int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the integral over one period
Consider the integral over one period \(\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\). Since \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) is periodic with period \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\), we can simplify this to:

\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the integral over one period
To evaluate \(\int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx\), we note that \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) completes \(2018\) full cycles within the interval \([0, \pi]\). Each cycle of \(\left|\sin(2018x)\right|\) from \(0\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2018}\) contributes the same area. Therefore, we can compute the integral over one cycle and multiply by the number of cycles:

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = 2018 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} \sin(2018x) \, dx
\]

### Step 5: Compute the integral over one cycle
Evaluate the integral over one cycle:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} \sin(2018x) \, dx = \left[ -\frac{\cos(2018x)}{2018} \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} = -\frac{\cos(\pi)}{2018} + \frac{\cos(0)}{2018} = \frac{2}{2018}
\]

Thus,

\[
\int_0^{\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = 2018 \cdot \frac{2}{2018} = 2
\]

### Step 6: Sum the integrals over all periods
Since there are \(2018\) such intervals from \(0\) to \(2018\pi\):

\[
\int_0^{2018\pi} \left|\sin(2018x)\right| \, dx = 2018 \cdot 2 = 4036
\]

### Step 7: Numerical approximation
The numerical approximation of \(4036\) is \(4036.0000000000\).

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{"answer": "4036",} \\
\text{"numerical_answer": "4036.0000000000"}
\end{aligned}
