To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand

First, we need to simplify the expression \(\sin(\cos^{-1}(x))\). Recall that \(\cos^{-1}(x)\) is the angle whose cosine is \(x\). Let \(\theta = \cos^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\cos(\theta) = x\) and \(\theta\) is in the range \([0, \pi]\).

Using the Pythagorean identity, we have:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the integral

Now, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx
\]

This integral represents the area under the curve \(y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). This curve is the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin. The area under this curve from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) is a quarter of the area of the unit circle.

The area of the unit circle is \(\pi\), so a quarter of this area is:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical approximation

To provide a numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), we use the value of \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\):
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} \approx \frac{3.141592653589793}{4} \approx 0.7853981633974483
\]

### Step 4: Output the final answer in JSON format

The exact answer in LaTeX is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), and the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is \(0.7853981634\).

Thus, the final answer in the required JSON format is:
```json
{"answer": "\\frac{\\pi}{4}", "numerical_answer": "0.7853981634"}
```
