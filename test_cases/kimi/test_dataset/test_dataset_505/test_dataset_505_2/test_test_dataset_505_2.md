To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Compute the Integral Analytically

First, we need to simplify the integrand \(\sin(\cos^{-1}(x))\).

Recall the trigonometric identity:
\[
\sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 \sin(\cos^{-1}(x)) \, dx = \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx
\]

This integral represents the area under the curve \(y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\). This curve is the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.

The area of a quarter circle of radius 1 is:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Therefore, the integral evaluates to:
\[
\int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To provide a numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), we use the known value of \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\).

Thus,
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} \approx \frac{3.141592653589793}{4} \approx 0.7853981633974483
\]

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is:
\[
0.7853981634
\]

### Step 3: Output the Final Answer in JSON Format

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{"answer": "}\frac{\pi}{4}\text{"}, \\
\text{"numerical_answer": "0.7853981634"}
