To solve the definite integral \(\int_1^{10} e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Simplify the integrand

First, simplify the expression inside the integral:
\[ e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x \]

Recall the properties of logarithms and exponentials:
- \( e^{\ln x} = x \)
- \( \ln e^x = x \)

Thus, the integrand simplifies to:
\[ e^{\ln x} + \ln e^x = x + x = 2x \]

So, the integral becomes:
\[ \int_1^{10} 2x \, dx \]

### Step 2: Compute the integral analytically

Now, integrate \( 2x \) with respect to \( x \):
\[ \int 2x \, dx = 2 \int x \, dx = 2 \left( \frac{x^2}{2} \right) = x^2 \]

Evaluate this from 1 to 10:
\[ \left[ x^2 \right]_1^{10} = 10^2 - 1^2 = 100 - 1 = 99 \]

### Step 3: Numerical approximation

The exact answer is 99. To provide a numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places:
\[ 99.0000000000 \]
