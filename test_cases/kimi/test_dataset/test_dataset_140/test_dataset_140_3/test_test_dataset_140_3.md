To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^2 x^3 \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right) I_0(x) \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and apply appropriate techniques. Here, \(I_0(x)\) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integrand is \(x^3 \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right) I_0(x)\). This integral is quite complex due to the presence of the logarithmic term and the Bessel function. Analytical solutions for such integrals are often not straightforward and may not be expressible in terms of elementary functions.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

Given the complexity of the integral, we will resort to numerical methods to approximate the value. We can use numerical integration techniques such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or more advanced methods like Gaussian quadrature.

Using a numerical integration tool (such as a software package like Mathematica, MATLAB, or Python's SciPy library), we can approximate the integral.

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation Calculation

Let's use Python's SciPy library to compute the numerical approximation:

```python
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.special import i0
import numpy as np

def integrand(x):
    return x**3 * np.log((2 + np.sqrt(4 - x**2)) / x) * i0(x)

result, error = quad(integrand, 0, 2)
print(f"Numerical approximation: {result:.10f}")
```

Running this code will give us the numerical approximation of the integral.

### Step 4: Output the Final Answer

After running the numerical integration, we obtain the following result:
