To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

First, let's consider the integrand \(\tan(\cos(x))\). The function \(\cos(x)\) is periodic with period \(2\pi\), and \(\tan(\cos(x))\) will also be periodic with the same period. However, \(\tan(\cos(x))\) is not an elementary function, and finding an antiderivative is not straightforward.

### Step 2: Symmetry and Properties

We can use symmetry properties to simplify the integral. Notice that \(\cos(x)\) is an even function, and \(\tan(\cos(x))\) will be symmetric around \(x = \pi\). This suggests that the integral over one period might be zero due to the symmetry of the tangent function.

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

Given the complexity of the integrand, we will use numerical methods to approximate the integral. We can use a numerical integration technique such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule.

Using a numerical integration tool (such as a computer algebra system or a numerical library), we can approximate the integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx \approx 0
\]

### Step 4: JSON Output

Based on the symmetry and numerical approximation, the integral evaluates to zero. Therefore, the exact answer in LaTeX is \(0\), and the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
