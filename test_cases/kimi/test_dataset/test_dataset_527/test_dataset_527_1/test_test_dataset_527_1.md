To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx\) does not have a straightforward antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use a known result from integral tables or special functions to evaluate it.

The integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx\) is a special case that can be evaluated using the Bessel function of the first kind, \(J_0\). Specifically, we have:

\[
\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos x) \, dx = \pi J_0(1)
\]

where \(J_0\) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To find the numerical value of \(\pi J_0(1)\), we can use the known value of \(J_0(1)\). The Bessel function \(J_0(1)\) is approximately:

\[
J_0(1) \approx 0.7651976865579666
\]

Thus, the numerical approximation of the integral is:

\[
\pi J_0(1) \approx \pi \times 0.7651976865579666 \approx 2.404825557695773
\]

### Step 3: JSON Output

The exact answer in LaTeX format is \(\pi J_0(1)\), and the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is 2.4048255577.

Here is the final answer in the requested JSON format:
