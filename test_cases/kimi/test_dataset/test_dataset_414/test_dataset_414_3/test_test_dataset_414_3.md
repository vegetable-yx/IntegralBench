To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-e}^e \frac{e^{-x^{2024}} \cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)} \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and the limits of integration.

### Step 1: Analyze the Integrand

The integrand is:
\[ f(x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}} \cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)} \]

### Step 2: Symmetry Considerations

Notice that the integrand \( f(x) \) is an even function because:
- \( e^{-x^{2024}} \) is even since \( e^{-(-x)^{2024}} = e^{-x^{2024}} \).
- \( \cos(2024x) \) is even since \( \cos(2024(-x)) = \cos(2024x) \).
- \( \arctan(2024x) \) is odd since \( \arctan(2024(-x)) = -\arctan(2024x) \).

Thus, the integrand \( f(x) \) is even:
\[ f(-x) = \frac{e^{-(-x)^{2024}} \cos(2024(-x))}{\arctan(2024(-x))} = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}} \cos(2024x)}{-\arctan(2024x)} = -f(x) \]

Since \( f(x) \) is an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval around zero will be zero:
\[ \int_{-e}^e f(x) \, dx = 0 \]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

Given the symmetry argument, the numerical approximation of the integral will also be zero.

### Step 4: Output the Final Answer

The exact answer is \( 0 \), and the numerical approximation is \( 0.0000000000 \).
