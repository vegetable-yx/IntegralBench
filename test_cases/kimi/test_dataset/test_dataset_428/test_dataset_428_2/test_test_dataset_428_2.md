To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor\), we need to understand the behavior of the floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\). The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is a step function that jumps at integer values of \(x\). Therefore, the integral can be interpreted as a sum of the integrand evaluated at these jumps.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the jumps of \(\lfloor x \rfloor\):**
   The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps at \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\) within the interval \([0, 3]\).

2. **Evaluate the integrand at these jumps:**
   - At \(x = 1\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps from 0 to 1.
   - At \(x = 2\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps from 1 to 2.
   - At \(x = 3\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) jumps from 2 to 3.

3. **Compute the integral as a sum of the integrand at these jumps:**
   \[
   \int_0^3 (x^2 + 1) \, d\lfloor x \rfloor = (1^2 + 1) \cdot (\lfloor 1 \rfloor - \lfloor 0 \rfloor) + (2^2 + 1) \cdot (\lfloor 2 \rfloor - \lfloor 1 \rfloor) + (3^2 + 1) \cdot (\lfloor 3 \rfloor - \lfloor 2 \rfloor)
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   = (1 + 1) \cdot (1 - 0) + (4 + 1) \cdot (2 - 1) + (9 + 1) \cdot (3 - 2)
   \]
   \[
   = 2 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 1 + 10 \cdot 1
   \]
   \[
   = 2 + 5 + 10
   \]
   \[
   = 17
   \]

### Numerical Approximation
The exact answer is already an integer, so the numerical approximation is the same as the exact answer.
