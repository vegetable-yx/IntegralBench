To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and break it down into manageable parts.

### Step 1: Understanding the Integrand

The integrand involves the fractional part \(\{x\}\) and the ceiling function \(\lceil x \rceil\). Recall that:
- \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).
- \(\lceil x \rceil\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\).

For any integer \(n \geq 0\), within the interval \([n, n+1)\), we have:
- \(\lceil x \rceil = n + 1\)
- \(\{x\} = x - n\)

Thus, the integrand within \([n, n+1)\) becomes:
\[
\frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{1 + (n + 1)} = \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{n + 2}
\]

### Step 2: Setting Up the Integral

We can split the integral into a sum of integrals over each interval \([n, n+1)\):
\[
\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{n + 2} \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Evaluating Each Integral

For each \(n\), we need to evaluate:
\[
\int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{n + 2} \, dx
\]

Let \(u = x - n\). Then \(du = dx\) and the limits of integration change from \(n\) to \(n+1\) to \(0\) to \(1\). The integral becomes:
\[
\int_0^1 \frac{u^{n+1}}{n + 2} \, du
\]

This is a standard integral:
\[
\int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du = \left[ \frac{u^{n+2}}{n+2} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{n+2}
\]

Thus, each integral evaluates to:
\[
\frac{1}{n + 2} \cdot \frac{1}{n + 2} = \frac{1}{(n + 2)^2}
\]

### Step 4: Summing the Series

The original integral is now:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + 2)^2}
\]

This is a shifted version of the Riemann zeta function \(\zeta(s)\) at \(s = 2\):
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + 2)^2} = \sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \zeta(2) - 1
\]

We know that \(\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\), so:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n + 2)^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation

The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\) is:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.6449340668
\]
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1 \approx 0.6449340668
\]

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\text{"answer": "}\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1\text{"}, \\
\text{"numerical_answer": "0.6449340668"}
\end{aligned}
}
