To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx\), we need to break it down into manageable parts. Here, \(\{x\}\) denotes the fractional part of \(x\), and \(\lceil x \rceil\) denotes the ceiling function, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(x\).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Integral:**
   The integral can be split into intervals where \(x\) is between integers. For each integer \(n\), the interval \([n, n+1)\) will have \(\lceil x \rceil = n+1\) and \(\{x\} = x - n\).

2. **Integral Over Each Interval:**
   For \(x \in [n, n+1)\), we have:
   \[
   \int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{1 + (n+1)} \, dx = \int_n^{n+1} \frac{(x - n)^{n+1}}{n+2} \, dx
   \]
   Let \(u = x - n\). Then \(du = dx\) and the limits change from \(0\) to \(1\):
   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{u^{n+1}}{n+2} \, du
   \]

3. **Evaluating the Integral:**
   The integral \(\int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du\) is straightforward:
   \[
   \int_0^1 u^{n+1} \, du = \left[ \frac{u^{n+2}}{n+2} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{n+2}
   \]
   Therefore, the integral over each interval \([n, n+1)\) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{n+2} \cdot \frac{1}{n+2} = \frac{1}{(n+2)^2}
   \]

4. **Summing Over All Intervals:**
   The total integral is the sum of these integrals over all intervals:
   \[
   \int_0^\infty \frac{\{x\}^{\lceil x \rceil}}{1 + \lceil x \rceil} \, dx = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)^2}
   \]

5. **Evaluating the Series:**
   The series \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)^2}\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
   \]
   This is a well-known series related to the Riemann zeta function:
   \[
   \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \zeta(2) - 1 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1
   \]

### Numerical Approximation
To find the numerical approximation:
\[
\frac{\pi^2}{6} - 1 \approx 1.6449340668 - 1 = 0.6449340668
\]
