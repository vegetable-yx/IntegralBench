To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

First, observe that the integrand \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\) is an odd function. This is because \(\sin(x)\) is an odd function and \(x^2 + 1\) is an even function. The product of an odd function and an even function is an odd function.

An odd function \(f(x)\) satisfies \(f(-x) = -f(x)\). For an odd function integrated over a symmetric interval \([-a, a]\), the integral is zero:
\[
\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0
\]
if \(f(x)\) is odd.

Since \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}\) is odd, we have:
\[
\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} \, dx = 0
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To verify the analytical result, we can use numerical methods to approximate the integral. However, given the symmetry and the properties of odd functions, the numerical approximation should also yield a result very close to zero.

Using a numerical integration tool or software (such as Python's `scipy.integrate.quad`), we can compute the integral numerically. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume the numerical computation confirms the analytical result.

### Step 3: JSON Output

The exact answer is \(0\), and the numerical approximation should also be very close to \(0\). Therefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:
