To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1} \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

First, observe that the integrand \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\) is an odd function. This is because \(\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\) and \(\frac{1}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{x^2 + 1}\), so:
\[
\frac{\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2 + 1} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} = -\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1}.
\]

The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around zero is zero. Therefore:
\[
\int_{-2023}^{2023} \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1} \, dx = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

Since the analytical solution is zero, the numerical approximation will also be zero. However, for completeness, we can confirm this using numerical methods. Using a numerical integration tool or software, we would find that the integral evaluates to a value very close to zero, confirming our analytical result.
