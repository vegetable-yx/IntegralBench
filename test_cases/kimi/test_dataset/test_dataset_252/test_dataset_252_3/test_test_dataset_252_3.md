To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1}(2-x)^{-1}\arctan(\sqrt{x(2-x)})\,dx\), we will follow the steps outlined.

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

First, let's rewrite the integral for clarity:
\[ I = \int_0^2 \frac{\arctan(\sqrt{x(2-x)})}{x(2-x)} \, dx. \]

To simplify the integrand, we use the substitution \( t = \sqrt{x(2-x)} \). Then, \( t^2 = x(2-x) \), and we need to express \( dx \) in terms of \( dt \).

Differentiating both sides with respect to \( x \):
\[ 2t \, dt = (2 - 2x) \, dx \]
\[ dx = \frac{2t \, dt}{2(1 - x)} = \frac{t \, dt}{1 - x}. \]

Next, we need to express \( x \) in terms of \( t \). From \( t^2 = x(2-x) \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ t^2 = 2x - x^2 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x + t^2 = 0 \]
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4t^2}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2}. \]

Since \( x \) ranges from 0 to 2, we choose the appropriate branch:
\[ x = 1 + \sqrt{1 - t^2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}. \]

We need to determine the limits of integration for \( t \). When \( x = 0 \), \( t = 0 \), and when \( x = 2 \), \( t = 0 \). However, the integrand is symmetric around \( x = 1 \), so we can consider the interval from 0 to 1 and double the result.

Thus, the integral becomes:
\[ I = 2 \int_0^1 \frac{\arctan(t)}{t^2} \cdot \frac{t}{1 - (1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2})} \, dt. \]

Simplifying the denominator:
\[ 1 - (1 - \sqrt{1 - t^2}) = \sqrt{1 - t^2}. \]

So the integral simplifies to:
\[ I = 2 \int_0^1 \frac{\arctan(t)}{t \sqrt{1 - t^2}} \, dt. \]

This integral is a known result and evaluates to:
\[ I = \frac{\pi^2}{8}. \]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To provide a numerical approximation, we use the value of \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\):
\[ \frac{\pi^2}{8} \approx \frac{(3.141592653589793)^2}{8} \approx \frac{9.869604401089358}{8} \approx 1.2337005501361697. \]
