To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2.0} x^{-1.0/4} (2.0 - x)^{-(1.0 + 2)/4} I_{1.0}\left(1.0 \sqrt[4]{x(2.0 - x)}\right) dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and apply appropriate techniques.

### Step 1: Analytical Solution

The integrand is:
\[ f(x) = x^{-1.0/4} (2.0 - x)^{-(1.0 + 2)/4} I_{1.0}\left(1.0 \sqrt[4]{x(2.0 - x)}\right) \]

Let's rewrite the exponents for clarity:
\[ f(x) = x^{-0.25} (2.0 - x)^{-0.75} I_{1.0}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2.0 - x)}\right) \]

The modified Bessel function of the first kind \(I_{1.0}(z)\) is a special function, and the integral involving such functions often does not have a straightforward analytical solution. However, we can attempt to simplify the integral by making a substitution.

Let \( t = \sqrt[4]{x(2.0 - x)} \). Then:
\[ t^4 = x(2.0 - x) \]
\[ t^4 = 2x - x^2 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x + t^4 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4t^4}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^4} \]

Since \(x\) ranges from 0 to 2, we need to consider the appropriate branch of the solution. For \(x\) in \([0, 2]\), we have:
\[ x = 1 + \sqrt{1 - t^4} \]

Now, we need to find \(dx\) in terms of \(dt\):
\[ dx = \frac{d}{dt} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - t^4}\right) dt = \frac{-2t^3}{\sqrt{1 - t^4}} dt \]

Substituting \(x\) and \(dx\) back into the integral:
\[ \int_0^{2.0} x^{-0.25} (2.0 - x)^{-0.75} I_{1.0}(t) \left(\frac{-2t^3}{\sqrt{1 - t^4}}\right) dt \]

This integral is still quite complex and does not simplify easily. Given the complexity, we may need to resort to numerical methods to find the exact value.

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

Using numerical integration techniques (such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or a numerical integration tool), we can approximate the integral.

Using a numerical integration tool (e.g., Python's `scipy.integrate.quad`), we can compute the integral:

```python
from scipy.integrate import quad
from scipy.special import iv
import numpy as np

def integrand(x):
    return x**(-0.25) * (2.0 - x)**(-0.75) * iv(1.0, np.power(x * (2.0 - x), 0.25))

result, error = quad(integrand, 0, 2.0)
print(result)
```

Running this code, we get the numerical approximation of the integral.

### Step 3: Numerical Result

The numerical approximation of the integral is approximately:
