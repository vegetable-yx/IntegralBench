To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we need to understand the functions involved. Here, \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) and \(\mathbf{E}(k)\) are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively.

The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{K}(k) = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta}} \, d\theta
\]
and the complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{E}(k) = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta} \, d\theta
\]

Given the integral:
\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx
\]

We can use known results from the theory of elliptic integrals. Specifically, there is a known result for the product of \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) and \(\mathbf{E}(k')\), where \(k' = \sqrt{1 - k^2}\) is the complementary modulus. The integral can be evaluated using the following identity:
\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(k') \, dk = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

However, our integral is in terms of \(x\) and \(\sqrt{1-x}\). To match the form, we make the substitution \(k = \sqrt{x}\), which implies \(dk = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} dx\). Thus, \(dx = 2k \, dk\). The limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) to \(k = 0\) to \(k = 1\).

Rewriting the integral in terms of \(k\):
\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-k^2}) \cdot 2k \, dk
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
2 \int_0^1 k \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-k^2}) \, dk
\]

Using the known result:
\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1-k^2}) \, dk = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

Thus, our integral becomes:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi
\]

Therefore, the exact answer is \(\pi\).
