To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx\), we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Compute the Integral Analytically

The integral \(\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx\) is a well-known integral that can be evaluated using the series expansion of the integrand.

First, we rewrite the integrand using the geometric series expansion for \(e^x - 1\):

\[ \frac{1}{e^x - 1} = \frac{1}{e^x (1 - e^{-x})} = \frac{e^{-x}}{1 - e^{-x}} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-nx} \]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \int_0^\infty x \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-nx} \, dx \]

We can interchange the sum and the integral (justified by uniform convergence):

\[ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_0^\infty x e^{-nx} \, dx \]

Now, we evaluate the inner integral \(\int_0^\infty x e^{-nx} \, dx\). This is a standard integral that can be solved using integration by parts or recognizing it as a Gamma function:

\[ \int_0^\infty x e^{-nx} \, dx = \frac{1}{n^2} \int_0^\infty t e^{-t} \, dt \]

where \(t = nx\). The integral \(\int_0^\infty t e^{-t} \, dt\) is the Gamma function \(\Gamma(2)\), which equals \(1!\):

\[ \int_0^\infty t e^{-t} \, dt = \Gamma(2) = 1 \]

Thus,

\[ \int_0^\infty x e^{-nx} \, dx = \frac{1}{n^2} \]

So, the original integral becomes:

\[ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \]

The series \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}\) is a well-known series that sums to \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\):

\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \]

Therefore, the exact value of the integral is:

\[ \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation

To provide a numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\), we use the known value of \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\):

\[ \frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx \frac{(3.141592653589793)^2}{6} \approx \frac{9.869604401089358}{6} \approx 1.6449340668482264 \]

Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is:

\[ 1.6449340668 \]
