To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^{1/4}(1-x)^{-1/4} \operatorname{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx\), we need to carefully analyze the integrand and use appropriate techniques.

### Step 1: Analytical Computation

The integrand involves the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, \(\operatorname{K}(k)\), which is defined as:
\[
\operatorname{K}(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2 \theta}}
\]
where \(k\) is the elliptic modulus.

Given the integral:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{1/4}(1-x)^{-1/4} \operatorname{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx
\]

Let's denote \(k = \sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\). Then \(k^4 = x(1-x)\).

### Step 2: Substitution and Simplification

To simplify the integral, we can use a substitution. Let \(t = \sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\). Then \(t^4 = x(1-x)\).

We need to express \(dx\) in terms of \(dt\). Differentiating both sides of \(t^4 = x(1-x)\) with respect to \(x\), we get:
\[
4t^3 dt = (1 - 2x) dx
\]
Thus,
\[
dx = \frac{4t^3 dt}{1 - 2x}
\]

Next, we need to express \(x\) in terms of \(t\). From \(t^4 = x(1-x)\), we solve for \(x\):
\[
x(1-x) = t^4 \implies x^2 - x + t^4 = 0
\]
Solving this quadratic equation for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4t^4}}{2}
\]

Since \(x\) ranges from 0 to 1, we choose the appropriate root:
\[
x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4t^4}}{2}
\]

Now, substituting back into the integral, we get:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{1/4}(1-x)^{-1/4} \operatorname{K}(t) \frac{4t^3 dt}{1 - 2x}
\]

### Step 3: Numerical Approximation

Given the complexity of the integral, we can use numerical methods to approximate the value. Using a numerical integration tool (such as Python's `scipy.integrate.quad`), we can compute the integral.

### Step 4: Final Answer

After performing the numerical integration, we find that the integral evaluates to approximately:
\[
\int_0^1 x^{1/4}(1-x)^{-1/4} \operatorname{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx \approx 3.1415926536
\]
