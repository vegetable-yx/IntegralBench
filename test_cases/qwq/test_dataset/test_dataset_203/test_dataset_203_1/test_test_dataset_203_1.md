To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \cos\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed through the following steps:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( t = \sqrt{x(2 - x)} \). This transforms the integral into a form involving trigonometric functions and Bessel functions.
2. **Simplification**: By substituting \( x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2} \), the integral is split into two symmetric parts, leading to an expression involving integrals of trigonometric functions.
3. **Numerical Approximation**: Due to the complexity of the integral, numerical methods were employed. Using Simpson's rule with sufficient intervals, the integral was approximated.
