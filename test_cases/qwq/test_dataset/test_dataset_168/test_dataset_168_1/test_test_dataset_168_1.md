To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{x}\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{x}}{1-\sqrt{x}}\right)\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - The integral is transformed using the substitution \(t = \sqrt{x}\), leading to the expression:
     \[
     2 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+t}{1-t}\right)}{t} \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-t^2}\right) dt
     \]
   - Recognizing the logarithmic term as \(2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^{2n+1}}{2n+1}\), we expand and interchange summation and integration (justified by convergence).
   - The integral is evaluated using properties of elliptic integrals and known series expansions, leading to the conclusion that the integral simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{2}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{2}\) is approximately \(4.9348022005\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
