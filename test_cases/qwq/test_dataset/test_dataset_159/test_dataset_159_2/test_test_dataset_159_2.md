To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{4} \sqrt{x} \cosh\left(2\sqrt[4]{x(4-x)}\right) \, dx\), we start by analyzing the integrand and attempting various substitutions to simplify it. 

After several attempts and substitutions, including trigonometric substitutions and series expansions, we found that the integral could be numerically approximated. Using numerical methods such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule with higher precision, we determined the numerical value of the integral.
