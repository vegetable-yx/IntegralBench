To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x \ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}} I_0(2x)\, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integrand involves a logarithm term and a modified Bessel function of the first kind \(I_0(2x)\).
   - The logarithm term \(\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\) is simplified using the hyperbolic arctangent function: \(2 \text{artanh}(\sqrt{1-x^2})\).
   - Through substitution and integration by parts, the integral is transformed and simplified.
   - Key steps include recognizing the antiderivative of \(x I_0(2x)\) and using properties of Bessel functions and hyperbolic functions.
   - After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral is found to evaluate to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using numerical methods like Simpson's rule with multiple intervals, the integral is approximated.
   - The numerical approximation converges to approximately \(1.5707963268\), which matches the exact value \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
