To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1}x^{-1/2}\left[1-\sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-2}dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytical Calculation
We start with the substitution \(x = \sin^2\theta\), which transforms the integral into:
\[
2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos\theta}{[1 - \sin\theta \cos\theta]^2} \, d\theta
\]
Using further substitutions and trigonometric identities, we eventually simplify the integral into terms involving Beta functions and Gamma functions. After detailed calculations, we find the exact answer to be:
\[
\frac{32 \sqrt{3} \pi}{27} + \frac{5}{6}
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of the exact expression is computed to be approximately \(7.2823977330\).

### Final Answer
The exact answer and its numerical approximation are:

\[
\boxed{\frac{32 \sqrt{3} \pi}{27} + \frac{5}{6}}
\]
\[
\text{Numerical approximation: } 7.2823977330
\]
