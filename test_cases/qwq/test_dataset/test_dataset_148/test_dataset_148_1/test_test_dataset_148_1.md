To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^{1/4}(1-x)^{-1/4} \operatorname{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right) dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognize the integral involves the complete elliptic integral of the first kind \( \operatorname{K}(k) \).
   - Use the series expansion of \( \operatorname{K}(k) \) in terms of hypergeometric functions.
   - Transform the integral into a series involving Gamma functions and simplify using properties of the Gamma function and hypergeometric series.
   - Through detailed series manipulation and recognizing the resulting series as a known hypergeometric function evaluated at a specific point, the integral simplifies to \(\frac{\pi^2}{5}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Calculate the numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{5}\) to 10 decimal places.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\{"answer": "\\frac{\\pi^2}{5}", "numerical_answer": "1.9739208802"\}}
\]
