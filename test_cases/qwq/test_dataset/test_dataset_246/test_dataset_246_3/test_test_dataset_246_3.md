To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^7 K_0^4(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral involves the fourth power of the modified Bessel function \(K_0(x)\).
   - Using the integral representation of \(K_0(x)\), we express \(K_0^4(x)\) as a product of four integrals.
   - By interchanging the order of integration and evaluating the resulting Gamma functions, we derive the exact form involving Gamma and Pi functions.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical approximation is computed using known values and integral approximations.
   - The result is rounded to 10 decimal places.
