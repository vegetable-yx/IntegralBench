To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^5 x^2 \cosh\left(2\sqrt{x(5-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed through the following steps:

1. **Substitution and Symmetry**:
   - Use the substitution \( t = x - 2.5 \), shifting the variable to center the quadratic term.
   - Recognize the symmetry and rewrite the integral in terms of trigonometric substitution \( t = 2.5 \sin\theta \).

2. **Integral Transformation**:
   - Transform the integral using trigonometric identities and simplify the hyperbolic cosine term.
   - Break the integral into manageable parts using even and odd function properties.

3. **Bessel Function Recognition**:
   - Recognize the integrals involve modified Bessel functions of the first kind \( I_1 \) and \( I_2 \).
   - Express the integral in terms of these Bessel functions after careful analysis and substitution.

4. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Use numerical methods or computational tools to approximate the value of the integral.

### Final Answer

The exact analytical solution is expressed in terms of modified Bessel functions of the first kind, and the numerical approximation is computed as follows:
