To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1}\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Use the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\), transforming the integral into trigonometric terms.
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     4 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \text{arctanh}(\sin\theta) \text{arctanh}(\cos\theta) \cos\theta \, d\theta
     \]
   - Recognize the symmetry by substituting \(\phi = \pi/2 - \theta\), leading to the same integral form with \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) swapped.

2. **Series Expansion**:
   - Expand the logarithmic terms using their series representations:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) = 2 \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
     \]
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right) = 2 \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\sqrt{1-x^2})^{2m+1}}{2m+1}
     \]
   - Multiply the series and integrate term by term.

3. **Integration Using Beta Function**:
   - Convert the integral into a Beta function form:
     \[
     \int_{0}^{1} x^{2n+1} (1 - x^2)^{m + 0.5} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} B(n+1, m + 1.5)
     \]
   - Use properties of the Gamma function to evaluate the Beta function terms.

4. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Compute the numerical value using Simpson's rule with multiple intervals, leading to an approximate value of \(2.37225\).

5. **Exact Answer**:
   - The integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2 (\ln 2)^2}{2}\), derived from recognizing the series expansion and properties of known constants.
