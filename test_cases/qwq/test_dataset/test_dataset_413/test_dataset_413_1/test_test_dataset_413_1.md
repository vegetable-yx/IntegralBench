To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\sqrt{506}} \sqrt{2024 - x^2} \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognize the integral as the area under the curve \(\sqrt{2024 - x^2}\), which is a semicircle of radius \(\sqrt{2024}\).
   - The integral \(\int_0^{a} \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \, dx\) represents the area of a quarter-circle with radius \(a\), which is \(\frac{\pi a^2}{4}\).
   - Here, \(a = \sqrt{2024}\), so the integral becomes \(\frac{\pi (\sqrt{2024})^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \cdot 2024}{4} = 506\pi\).

2. **Verification via Trigonometric Substitution**:
   - Substitute \(x = \sqrt{2024} \sin \theta\), leading to the integral \(2024 \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2 \theta \, d\theta\).
   - Using the power-reduction formula, this integral evaluates to \(2024 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = 506\pi\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Compute \(506\pi\) numerically using \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\).
   - The result is approximately \(1589.6458827164\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
