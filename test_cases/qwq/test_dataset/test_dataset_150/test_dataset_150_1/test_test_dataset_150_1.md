To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{2}x^{1/4}(2-x)^{-1/4}\mathbf{K}(\sqrt[4]{x(2-x)})\,dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognize the symmetry of the integrand around \(x = 1\).
   - Use substitutions such as \(x = 2t^2/(1 + t^2)\) and others to simplify the integral.
   - After several substitutions and transformations, the integral is recognized to involve known constants related to elliptic integrals and Gamma functions.
   - The integral evaluates to a form involving \(\pi^{3/2}\) and \(\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Compute the numerical value using known constants and approximations of special functions.
   - The numerical value is found to be approximately \(3.938443137\).
