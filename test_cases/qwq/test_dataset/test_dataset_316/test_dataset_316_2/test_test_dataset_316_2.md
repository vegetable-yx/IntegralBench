To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{2} x^{-3/2} \ln(1+x) \ln\left(\frac{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2 - x}}{\sqrt{x}}\right) \, dx\), we followed these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral was transformed using substitutions and simplifications. A key substitution was \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2 - x}{x}} \), which led to an integral involving hyperbolic functions.
   - After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral was recognized to involve terms related to \(\pi\) and \(\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral was approximated numerically using the trapezoidal rule with multiple intervals. The approximate value was found to be close to \(\pi \sqrt{2}\).

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The exact answer was determined to be \(\pi \sqrt{2}\) based on analytical steps and numerical approximation.
