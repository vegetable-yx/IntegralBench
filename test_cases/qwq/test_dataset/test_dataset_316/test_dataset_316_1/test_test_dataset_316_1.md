To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{2}x^{-3/2}\ln\left(1+x\right)\ln\frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2-x}}{\sqrt{x}}\,dx\), we followed these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral was simplified by expressing the logarithm term \(\ln\frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2-x}}{\sqrt{x}}\) using properties of logarithms and substitutions.
   - The integral was transformed using substitutions such as \(t = \sqrt{(2 - x)/x}\) and \(z = \arcsinh(y)\).
   - After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral was recognized to evaluate to \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\) was calculated to be approximately \(1.2337005505\).
