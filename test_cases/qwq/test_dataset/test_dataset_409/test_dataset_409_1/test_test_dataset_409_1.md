To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \arctan(x^2 - x + 1) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Integration**:
   - Recognize the symmetry of the integrand by substituting \( t = 1 - x \). This shows the integrand is symmetric around \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Use integration by parts with \( u = \arctan(x^2 - x + 1) \) and \( dv = dx \). This leads to:
     \[
     \int_0^1 \arctan(x^2 - x + 1) \, dx = \left[ x \arctan(x^2 - x + 1) \right]_0^1 - \int_0^1 \frac{x(2x - 1)}{1 + (x^2 - x + 1)^2} \, dx
     \]
   - The boundary term evaluates to \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).
   - The remaining integral \( J = \int_0^1 \frac{x(2x - 1)}{1 + (x^2 - x + 1)^2} \, dx \) is analyzed through substitutions and symmetry considerations.
   - After several substitutions and recognizing the integral's symmetry, we find that the integral evaluates to \( \ln 2 \).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using numerical methods (Simpson's rule), the integral is approximated to be close to \( \ln 2 \approx 0.6931471806 \).

3. **Final Result**:
   - The exact value of the integral is \( \ln 2 \).
   - The numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is \( 0.6931471806 \).

The final answer in JSON format is:
