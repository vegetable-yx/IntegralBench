To compute the definite integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^99(x) \, dx\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - Express \(\sin^99(x)\) using the binomial expansion for complex exponentials:
     \[
     \sin^99(x) = \left( \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \right)^{99} = \frac{1}{(2i)^{99}} \sum_{k=0}^{99} (-1)^k \binom{99}{k} e^{i(99 - 2k)x}
     \]
   - Multiply by \(\sin(101x)\) which is \(\frac{e^{i101x} - e^{-i101x}}{2i}\):
     \[
     \sin(101x) \sin^99(x) = \frac{1}{(2i)^{100}} \sum_{k=0}^{99} (-1)^k \binom{99}{k} \left[ e^{i(200 - 2k)x} - e^{-i(2 + 2k)x} \right]
     \]
   - Integrate each term over \([0, 2\pi]\). The integral of \(e^{inx}\) over \([0, 2\pi]\) is \(2\pi\) if \(n = 0\) and 0 otherwise. 
   - For the terms \(e^{i(200 - 2k)x}\), setting \(200 - 2k = 0\) gives \(k = 100\), which is outside the summation range (0 to 99).
   - For the terms \(e^{-i(2 + 2k)x}\), setting \(- (2 + 2k) = 0\) gives \(k = -1\), which is also outside the summation range.
   - Since no terms contribute to the integral, the result is 0.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of the integral is \(0.0000000000\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
