To compute the definite integral \(\int \sin(101x) \sin^99(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - We use the exponential form of sine functions and expand \(\sin^99(x)\) using the binomial theorem:
     \[
     \sin^99(x) = \left( \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} \right)^{99}
     \]
   - Expanding this using the binomial theorem gives a sum of terms involving \(e^{i(99 - 2k)x}\) for \(k\) from 0 to 99.
   - Multiplying by \(\sin(101x)\) (expressed as \(\frac{e^{i101x} - e^{-i101x}}{2i}\)) results in terms with exponents \(200 - 2k\) and \(-2 - 2k\).
   - Integrating over a full period \(0\) to \(2\pi\), each exponential term \(e^{inx}\) integrates to zero unless \(n = 0\). However, the exponents \(200 - 2k\) and \(-2 - 2k\) cannot be zero for any \(k\) in the range \(0 \leq k \leq 99\), leading to all terms integrating to zero.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral over \(0\) to \(2\pi\) results in zero, so the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
