To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I_1\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we start by expanding the modified Bessel function \(I_1(z)\) using its series representation:

\[
I_1(z) = \frac{z}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(z/2)^{2k}}{k! (k+1)!}
\]

Substituting \(z = \sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)}\), we rewrite the integrand and interchange the summation and integration:

\[
\int_0^1 x^{-1/4} (1 - x)^{1/4} I_1\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1 - x)}\right) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4^k k! (k+1)!} \int_0^1 x^k (1 - x)^{k + 1/2} \, dx
\]

The integral inside the summation is a Beta function \(B(k+1, k + 3/2)\):

\[
\int_0^1 x^k (1 - x)^{k + 1/2} \, dx = \frac{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(k + 3/2)}{\Gamma(2k + 5/2)}
\]

Using properties of the Gamma function, we simplify the terms and evaluate the series numerically. The series converges rapidly, and the first few terms give a precise approximation.
