To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 |1 - |1 - |1 - x||| \, dx\), we start by simplifying the nested absolute value expressions.

1. **Innermost Absolute Value**:  
   The innermost expression is \(|1 - x|\). Since \(x \in [0, 1]\), this simplifies to \(1 - x\).

2. **Middle Absolute Value**:  
   The next layer is \(|1 - (1 - x)| = |x|\). Since \(x \in [0, 1]\), this simplifies to \(x\).

3. **Outermost Absolute Value**:  
   The outermost layer is \(|1 - x|\). This is already simplified as \(1 - x\) for \(x \in [0, 1]\).

Thus, the integrand simplifies to \(|1 - x|\), which is \(1 - x\) over the interval \([0, 1]\).

2. **Integral Calculation**:  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 (1 - x) \, dx
   \]  
   The antiderivative of \(1 - x\) is \(x - \frac{x^2}{2}\). Evaluating from 0 to 1:  
   \[
   \left[ x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(0 - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

3. **Numerical Approximation**:  
   The exact value is \(\frac{1}{2}\), which is numerically \(0.5000000000\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
