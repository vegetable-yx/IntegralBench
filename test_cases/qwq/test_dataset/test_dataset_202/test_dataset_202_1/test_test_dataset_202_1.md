To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2.0} x \cos\left(1.0 \sqrt{x(2.0 - x)}\right) dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Substitute \( t = x - 1 \), leading to \( x = t + 1 \) and the integral limits changing from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \) into \( t = -1 \) to \( t = 1 \).
   - The integral simplifies to \( 2 \int_{0}^{1} \cos\left(\sqrt{1 - t^2}\right) dt \).
   - Using substitution \( t = \sin\theta \), the integral becomes \( 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \cos(\cos\theta) \cos\theta d\theta \).
   - This integral can be expressed in terms of an infinite series, but it does not simplify to a closed-form expression involving elementary functions. The exact answer is represented by the series:
     \[
     2 \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m 2^m m!}{(2m)! (2m+1)!!}
     \]
     or equivalently using Bessel functions, but the problem requires a numerical approximation.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using series expansion and numerical integration techniques, the integral evaluates to approximately \( 1.376528208 \).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{"answer": "2 \\int_{0}^{1} \\cos\\left(\\sqrt{1 - t^2}\\right) dt", "numerical_answer": "1.376528208"}
\]
