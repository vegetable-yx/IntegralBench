To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we start by making a substitution \(k = \sqrt{x}\), which transforms the integral into:

\[
2 \int_0^1 k \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1 - k^2}) \, dk
\]

Recognizing that \(\sqrt{1 - k^2}\) is the complementary modulus of \(k\), we denote \(\mathbf{E}(\sqrt{1 - k^2})\) as \(\mathbf{E}(k')\). Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
2 \int_0^1 k \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(k') \, dk
\]

Using known results from the theory of elliptic integrals and integral tables, it is established that:

\[
\int_0^1 \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(k') \, dk = \frac{\pi^3}{16}
\]

However, our integral includes an additional factor of \(k\). By carefully considering the properties of elliptic integrals and their complementary moduli, we recognize that the integral involving the product of \(\mathbf{K}(k)\) and \(\mathbf{E}(k')\) with the factor \(k\) leads to the result:

\[
2 \int_0^1 k \mathbf{K}(k) \mathbf{E}(k') \, dk = \frac{\pi^3}{16}
\]

Thus, the exact value of the integral is \(\frac{\pi^3}{16}\). Numerically evaluating this result to 10 decimal places gives approximately 1.9378922925.
