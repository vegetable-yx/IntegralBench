The integral \(\int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx\) can be computed by breaking it into intervals where the fractional part \(\{x\}\) is expressed as \(x - n\) for integers \(n\). 

1. **Split the integral into intervals**:
   \[
   \int_0^4 \{x\}^4 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^4 \, dx + \int_1^2 (x-1)^4 \, dx + \int_2^3 (x-2)^4 \, dx + \int_3^4 (x-3)^4 \, dx
   \]

2. **Compute each integral**:
   - For \(\int_0^1 x^4 \, dx\):
     \[
     \left[ \frac{x^5}{5} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{5}
     \]
   - For \(\int_1^2 (x-1)^4 \, dx\), substitute \(t = x - 1\):
     \[
     \int_0^1 t^4 \, dt = \frac{1}{5}
     \]
   - Similarly, the third and fourth integrals also evaluate to \(\frac{1}{5}\).

3. **Sum the results**:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

4. **Numerical approximation**:
   The exact value \(\frac{4}{5}\) is \(0.8\) when converted to a decimal, which rounds to \(0.8000000000\).
