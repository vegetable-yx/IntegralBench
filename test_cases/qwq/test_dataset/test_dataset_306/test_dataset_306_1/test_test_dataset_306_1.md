To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1/2}(2.0 - x)^{-1/2} \ln\left(\sqrt{x(2.0 - x)} + \sqrt{1 + x(2.0 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Simplify the Integrand**:
   The integrand involves terms \(x^{-1/2}(2 - x)^{-1/2}\) and a logarithmic term. We recognize that the logarithmic term can be expressed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function:
   \[
   \ln\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)} + \sqrt{1 + x(2 - x)}\right) = \sinh^{-1}\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right)
   \]

2. **Substitution**:
   We use the substitution \(x = 2t\), transforming the integral limits from \(0\) to \(2\) into \(0\) to \(1\). This simplifies the integrand and leads to:
   \[
   \int_0^1 \frac{\sinh^{-1}(2\sqrt{t(1 - t)})}{\sqrt{t(1 - t)}} \, dt
   \]

3. **Further Substitution**:
   Using \(t = \sin^2\theta\), the integral becomes:
   \[
   2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sinh^{-1}(\sin 2\theta) \, d\theta
   \]
   This integral is transformed into:
   \[
   \int_0^\pi \sinh^{-1}(\sin \phi) \, d\phi
   \]

4. **Symmetry and Evaluation**:
   By symmetry and properties of the integrand, the integral is evaluated to be:
   \[
   \pi \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})
   \]

5. **Numerical Approximation**:
   The numerical approximation of \(\pi \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})\) is calculated to be approximately \(2.7725887222\).
