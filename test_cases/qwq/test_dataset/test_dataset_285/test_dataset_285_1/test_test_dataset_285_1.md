To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \ln\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - Recognize that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}) = \sinh^{-1}(x)\).
   - Use substitution \(t = \arccos(x)\), leading to \(x = \cos(t)\) and \(dx = -\sin(t) \, dt\).
   - Transform the integral into a form involving trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions.
   - After several substitutions and integrations by parts, the integral is simplified to involve known constants and logarithmic terms.
   - The final analytical result is derived using properties of logarithmic and inverse trigonometric functions, leading to the expression:
     \[
     \frac{\pi^2}{8} \ln\left(1 + \sqrt{2}\right) - \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^2
     \]

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value is computed using the derived analytical expression.
   - The result, rounded to 10 decimal places, is approximately \(0.4701420641\).
