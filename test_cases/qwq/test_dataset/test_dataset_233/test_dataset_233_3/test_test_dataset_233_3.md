To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1} x^{-3/4} (1-x)^{-1/4} \left[1 - \sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-3/2} \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: We use the substitution \(x = \sin^2 \theta\), which transforms the integral into a trigonometric form. This substitution simplifies the terms involving \(x\) and \(1-x\).

2. **Transformation**: The integral becomes:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sin^{-1/2} \theta \cos^{1/2} \theta \left[1 - \sin \theta \cos \theta\right]^{-3/2} \, d\theta
   \]

3. **Further Substitution**: We use the substitution \(t = \sqrt{x(1-x)}\), which simplifies the integral to:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{1/2} \frac{(1 - t)^{-3/2}}{\sqrt{1 - 4t^2}} \, dt
   \]

4. **Simplification**: By making another substitution \(u = 2t\), the integral is transformed into a form that can be evaluated using known Beta function properties and trigonometric identities.

5. **Beta Function Recognition**: The integral is recognized as a form of the Beta function, leading to the exact solution involving \(\pi\) and \(\sqrt{2}\).

6. **Final Result**: The integral evaluates to \(2\sqrt{2}\pi\).
