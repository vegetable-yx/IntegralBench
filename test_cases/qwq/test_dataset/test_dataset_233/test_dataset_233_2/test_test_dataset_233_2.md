To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{1} x^{-3/4} (1-x)^{-1/4} \left[1 - \sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-3/2} \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - The integral is recognized to involve terms that can be transformed using substitutions related to trigonometric identities and Beta functions.
   - After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral is found to be related to the Beta function \(B\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}\right)\) multiplied by a factor involving \(\sqrt{2}\).
   - The key steps involve recognizing the integral's form and applying properties of the Gamma function, leading to the result \(2\sqrt{2}\pi\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(2\sqrt{2}\pi\) is approximated to 10 decimal places.
