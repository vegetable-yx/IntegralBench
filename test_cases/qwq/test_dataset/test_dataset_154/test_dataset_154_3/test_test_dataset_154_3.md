To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1\frac{x^{-1}}{\sqrt{1^2x^2+1}}\ln\left(1x+\sqrt{1^2x^2+1}\right)\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1^2-x^2}}{x}\:dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - Recognize that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1})\) is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\).
   - Recognize that \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) can be transformed using trigonometric substitution \(x = \sin\theta\), leading to \(\ln(\cot(\theta/2))\).
   - Use substitution and symmetry properties to show that the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical approximation of the integral is calculated to be approximately \(1.2337005501\).

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The exact answer in LaTeX is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\pi^2}{8}}\).
   - The numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is \(1.2337005501\).
