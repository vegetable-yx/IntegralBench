To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \arcsin\left(0.5\sqrt{x(1-x)}\right) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - The integral is transformed using substitutions and properties of elliptic integrals. Through a series of substitutions and integration by parts, the integral is expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, \(K(k)\) and \(E(k)\), where \(k = \frac{1}{4}\).
   - The exact solution is derived as:
     \[
     \frac{\pi}{8} - \frac{1}{4}\left[K\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - E\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)\right]
     \]
   - Here, \(K(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and \(E(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using numerical methods and known values of elliptic integrals, the integral is approximated. The numerical value is found to be approximately \(0.1979287500\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
