To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^{2.0} x^{1/2} \sin\left(1.0 \sqrt[4]{x(2.0 - x)}\right) dx\), we first attempted several analytical methods including substitutions, integration by parts, and series expansions. However, these methods did not yield a closed-form solution. 

### Numerical Approximation:
Using Simpson's rule with \(n = 8\) intervals (step size \(\Delta x = 0.25\)), we approximated the integral. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Substitution and Transformation**:
   - The integral was transformed using substitutions to simplify the integrand.
   - The final form of the integral to approximate was \(\int_0^2 \sin\left( \sqrt[4]{u(2 - u)} \right) du\).

2. **Simpson's Rule Application**:
   - With \(n = 8\) intervals, the integral was evaluated at points \(u = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0\).
   - The function values at these points were computed and combined using Simpson's rule.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result of the numerical approximation using Simpson's rule was found to be approximately \(1.4438\).
