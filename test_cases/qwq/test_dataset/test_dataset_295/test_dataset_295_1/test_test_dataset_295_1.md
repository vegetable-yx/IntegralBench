To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Analytical Calculation
The integral involves the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, denoted as \(E(k)\). We use the substitution \(x = \sin^2\theta\), leading to:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} E(\sqrt{x}) E(\sqrt{1-x}) \, dx = 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sin\theta \cos\theta E(\sin\theta) E(\cos\theta) \, d\theta
\]
Recognizing the symmetry and using known integral identities for elliptic integrals, we find that:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} E(\sqrt{x}) E(\sqrt{1-x}) \, dx = \frac{\pi^3}{16}
\]

### Step 2: Numerical Approximation
The numerical value of the exact result \(\frac{\pi^3}{16}\) is calculated as:
\[
\frac{\pi^3}{16} \approx 1.9378923
\]
