After carefully considering various approaches and recognizing the complexity of the integral involving modified Bessel functions, I conclude that the integral does not simplify easily using elementary functions. However, leveraging known integral formulas and properties of Bessel functions, the integral evaluates to a form involving these functions. 

The exact answer is expressed in terms of Bessel functions, and the numerical approximation is computed using standard values.
