To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x \arctan\left(\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Substitution**: Let \(x = 1 + \sin\theta\). This transforms the integral into a more manageable form. The limits of integration change from \(x = 0\) to \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) and from \(x = 2\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The expression under the square root simplifies to \(\cos\theta\), and the differential \(dx\) becomes \(\cos\theta \, d\theta\).

2. **Simplification**: The integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} (1 + \sin\theta) \arctan(\cos\theta) \cos\theta \, d\theta
   \]
   By symmetry and properties of odd/even functions, this simplifies to:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \arctan(\cos\theta) \cos\theta \, d\theta
   \]

3. **Integration by Parts**: Let \(u = \arctan(\cos\theta)\) and \(dv = \cos\theta \, d\theta\). After applying integration by parts and simplifying, the integral reduces to:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin^2\theta}{1 + \cos^2\theta} \, d\theta
   \]

4. **Further Simplification**: Using trigonometric identities and substitutions, the integral is split and transformed into standard integrals. The key steps involve recognizing the integral of \(\frac{1}{1 + \cos^2\theta}\) using the substitution \(t = \tan\theta\), leading to:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + \cos^2\theta} \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}}
   \]

5. **Combining Results**: After combining all parts and simplifying, the integral evaluates to:
   \[
   \pi(\sqrt{2} - 1)
   \]

6. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical value of the result, rounded to 10 decimal places, is approximately \(1.3012902954\).
