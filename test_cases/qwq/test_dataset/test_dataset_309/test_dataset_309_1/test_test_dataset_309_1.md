To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2} x^{-1/4}(2 - x)^{-3/4} \ln\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{x(2 - x)}}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: Use the substitution \(t = \frac{x}{2}\), which transforms the integral limits from \(0\) to \(2\) into \(0\) to \(1\). This simplifies the integral to:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} t^{-1/4}(1 - t)^{-3/4} \ln\left(\sqrt{2} (t(1 - t))^{1/4} + \sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{t(1 - t)}}\right) \, dt
   \]

2. **Trigonometric Substitution**: Let \(t = \sin^2(\theta)\), which transforms the integral further. This substitution simplifies the integrand using trigonometric identities and properties of logarithmic functions.

3. **Simplification**: After substitution, the logarithmic term inside the integral simplifies to \(\cosh^{-1}(\sin \theta + \cos \theta)\), which is recognized as the inverse hyperbolic cosine function. The integral then becomes:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \tan^{1/2}(\theta) \cosh^{-1}(\sin \theta + \cos \theta) \, d\theta
   \]

4. **Symmetry and Evaluation**: By recognizing the symmetry and properties of the integrand, the integral is evaluated using known results and substitutions. The integral is found to simplify to a known multiple of \(\pi\).

5. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical value of the integral is approximated to 10 decimal places.
