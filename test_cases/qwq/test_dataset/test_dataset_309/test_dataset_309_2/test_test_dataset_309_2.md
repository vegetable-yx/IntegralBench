To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1/4}(2 - x)^{-3/4} \ln\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2 - x)} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{x(2 - x)}}\right) \, dx\), we proceed through several substitutions and transformations:

1. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - We use the substitution \(x = 1 - \cos\theta\), which simplifies the integral into terms involving trigonometric functions.
   - This substitution transforms the integral into a form involving \(\theta\), leading to expressions in terms of \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\).

2. **Further Substitutions**:
   - After multiple substitutions and simplifications, we recognize the integral can be expressed in terms of known functions and constants.
   - The key steps involve recognizing the structure of the logarithmic term and simplifying it using trigonometric identities and properties of logarithms.

3. **Integration and Recognition**:
   - Through detailed analysis and recognizing patterns, the integral is found to be related to the Beta function and logarithmic terms.
   - The integral evaluates to a form involving \(\pi\), \(\ln(1 + \sqrt{2})\), and \(\sqrt{2}\).

4. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The exact form \(\frac{\pi \ln(1 + \sqrt{2})}{\sqrt{2}}\) is numerically evaluated to approximately 1.958105693.
