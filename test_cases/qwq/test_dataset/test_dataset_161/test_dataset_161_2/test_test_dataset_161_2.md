To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{2} x^{1/4}(2-x)^{-1/4}\cosh\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2-x)}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral is symmetric around \(x = 1\). Using the substitution \(t = \left(\frac{x}{2-x}\right)^{1/4}\), we transform the integral.
   - After substitution, the integral simplifies to \(\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{8t^4}{(1+t^4)^2} \cosh\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}t}{\sqrt{1+t^4}}\right) dt\).
   - Recognizing the integral's form and properties, we find that the exact result is \(\pi \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\pi \cdot 2^{1/4}\) is calculated as follows:
     - \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\)
     - \(2^{1/4} \approx 1.189207115002721\)
     - Multiplying these values gives approximately \(3.7360625934\).
