To compute the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{3+\sqrt{8}}\right) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognize that \(a = 3 + \sqrt{8} = ( \sqrt{2} + 1 )^2\) and \(b = \frac{1}{a} = ( \sqrt{2} - 1 )^2\).
   - Use integration by parts with \(u = \arctan(x^a)\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx\), leading to:
     \[
     I(a) = \left[ \arctan(x^a) \arctan(x) \right]_{0}^{1} - a \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\arctan(x) x^{a-1}}{1 + x^{2a}} \, dx
     \]
   - The boundary term evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\).
   - Recognize that the remaining integral involves \(I(b)\), leading to the equation:
     \[
     I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{16} - I(b)
     \]
   - By symmetry and the reciprocal relationship \(a \cdot b = 1\), we find \(I(a) = I(b)\). Thus:
     \[
     I(a) + I(b) = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \implies 2I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \implies I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{32}
     \]

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{32}\) rounded to 10 decimal places is approximately \(0.3084251376\).
