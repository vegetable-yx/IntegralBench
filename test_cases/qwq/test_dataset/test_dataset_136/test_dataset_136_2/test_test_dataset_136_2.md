To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{-1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}[1-0.5x(2-x)]^{1/2}dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - The integrand is transformed using substitutions and trigonometric identities.
   - After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals of the second kind.
   - The integral is found to be \(2 E\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\), where \(E(k)\) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus \(k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Using known values of elliptic integrals and constants, the numerical approximation is calculated.
   - The numerical value is approximately \(4.524287762\).

The final answer in JSON format is:
