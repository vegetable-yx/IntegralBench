To solve the definite integral \(\int_1^e \frac{\cos(\ln x)}{x} \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( u = \ln x \). Then, \( du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx \), which transforms the integral. The limits of integration change from \( x = 1 \) to \( u = 0 \) and from \( x = e \) to \( u = 1 \).

2. **Rewrite the Integral**: The integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} \cos(u) \, du
   \]

3. **Integrate**: The integral of \(\cos(u)\) with respect to \(u\) is \(\sin(u)\):
   \[
   \left[ \sin(u) \right]_{0}^{1} = \sin(1) - \sin(0)
   \]

4. **Evaluate**: Since \(\sin(0) = 0\), the result simplifies to:
   \[
   \sin(1)
   \]

5. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical value of \(\sin(1)\) (in radians) rounded to 10 decimal places is \(0.8414709848\).
