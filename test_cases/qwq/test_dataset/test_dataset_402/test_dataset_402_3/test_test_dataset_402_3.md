The integral \(\int_1^{\pi/3} \sec(x)\left(\tan(x)\ln(x) + \frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx\) was evaluated by recognizing that the integrand can be split and simplified through integration by parts. The integral simplifies to \(2 \ln\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\), and its numerical approximation is \(0.0912210226\).
