To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x^{-0.5}(1-x)^{-(-0.5+0.25)/2-1}\left(1+\sqrt{1-x}\right)^{2(0.25)}\ln\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x}}\right)dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the Exponents**:
   - The exponent on \((1 - x)\) is \(-(-0.5 + 0.25)/2 - 1 = -0.875\).
   - The term \(\left(1 + \sqrt{1 - x}\right)^{0.5}\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x}}\).

2. **Substitution**:
   - Use the substitution \(t = \sqrt{1 - x}\), leading to \(x = 1 - t^2\) and \(dx = -2t dt\).
   - Transform the integral into a form involving the Beta function and its derivatives.

3. **Split the Integral**:
   - Split the integral into parts involving logarithmic terms and express them using the Beta function and its derivatives.
   - Recognize that the integral can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the Beta function with respect to parameters.

4. **Evaluate the Integrals**:
   - Use properties of the Beta function \(B(a, b)\) and its derivatives involving the digamma function \(\psi\).
   - Compute the necessary Beta function values and constants.

5. **Combine Results**:
   - Combine the results from the Beta function derivatives and constants to form the exact expression.
   - Numerically approximate the result using known values of the Beta function and constants.

The exact answer is expressed in terms of the Beta function \(B\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\) and constants involving \(\pi\) and \(\ln 2\). The numerical approximation is calculated using these values.
