To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x^{-3/4}(1-x)^{-1/4}\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(1-x)}\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognize the integral involves the complete elliptic integral of the first kind \(\mathbf{K}(k)\).
   - Use the substitution \(x = \sin^4\theta\), transforming the integral into a form involving trigonometric functions and elliptic integrals.
   - After substitution, the integral simplifies to \(4 \int_0^{\pi/2} \mathbf{K}(\sin\theta \cos\theta) \, d\theta\).
   - Further substitution and symmetry considerations lead to the integral being evaluated in terms of known constants involving \(\pi\).

2. **Steps**:
   - The substitution \(x = \sin^4\theta\) simplifies the integrand.
   - The integral transforms into a form involving \(\mathbf{K}(\sin\theta \cos\theta)\).
   - Using properties of elliptic integrals and symmetry, the integral is evaluated to \(\frac{\pi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\) is approximately \(4.9348022005\).
