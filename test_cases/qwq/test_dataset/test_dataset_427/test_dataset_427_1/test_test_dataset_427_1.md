To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 (x^6 + x^4 + x^2) \sqrt{2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6} \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - We assume the antiderivative is of the form \((Ax^7 + Bx^5 + Cx^3 + Dx)\sqrt{2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6}\).
   - By differentiating this form and equating it to the integrand, we solve for the coefficients \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - Through detailed algebraic manipulation and coefficient matching, we find \(A = \frac{1}{9}\), \(B = \frac{1}{6}\), \(C = \frac{1}{3}\), and \(D = 0\).
   - The antiderivative is therefore \(\left( \frac{1}{9}x^7 + \frac{1}{6}x^5 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 \right) \sqrt{2x^4 + 3x^2 + 6}\).

2. **Evaluation at Bounds**:
   - Evaluating the antiderivative from 0 to 1:
     - At \(x = 1\), the value is \(\left( \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} \right) \sqrt{2(1)^4 + 3(1)^2 + 6} = \frac{11}{18} \sqrt{11}\).
     - At \(x = 0\), the value is 0.
   - Thus, the definite integral evaluates to \(\frac{11\sqrt{11}}{18}\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{11\sqrt{11}}{18}\) is approximately \(2.0268262608\).
