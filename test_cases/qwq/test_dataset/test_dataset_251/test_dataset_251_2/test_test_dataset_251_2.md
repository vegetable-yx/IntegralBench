To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^{2.0} \frac{1}{x} \arctan\left(1.0\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - We use the substitution \(x = 2 \sin^2 \theta\), which transforms the integral into a form involving trigonometric functions.
   - After substitution, the integral simplifies to:
     \[
     I = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \cot \theta \arctan(\sin 2\theta) \, d\theta
     \]
   - Further simplification using trigonometric identities and symmetry considerations leads to:
     \[
     I = \frac{\pi^2}{4}
     \]

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi^2}{4}\) is calculated to be approximately \(2.4674011003\).
