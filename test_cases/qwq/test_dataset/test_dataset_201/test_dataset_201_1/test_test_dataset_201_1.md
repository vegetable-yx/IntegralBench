The definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{2.0}\cos\left(1.0\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}\right)dx\) was computed analytically and numerically. The integral was transformed using substitutions and series expansions, leading to the conclusion that it cannot be expressed in elementary functions but can be represented as an infinite series involving special functions. The numerical approximation was obtained using series summation and verified with numerical integration techniques.
