To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2} x \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right) I_0(x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - We start by using integration by parts on the integral. Let \(u = \ln\left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{4 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) and \(dv = x I_0(x) \, dx\). This leads to:
     \[
     I = 2 \int_0^2 \frac{I_1(x)}{\sqrt{4 - x^2}} \, dx
     \]
   - Substituting \(x = 2 \sin \theta\), the integral simplifies to:
     \[
     J = \int_0^{\pi/2} I_1(2 \sin \theta) \, d\theta
     \]
   - Through series expansion and integral manipulations, we find that:
     \[
     J = \frac{\cosh(2) - 1}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, the original integral \(I\) becomes:
     \[
     I = 2J = \cosh(2) - 1
     \]

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\cosh(2)\) is approximately \(3.7621956910833065\). Subtracting 1 gives:
     \[
     \cosh(2) - 1 \approx 2.7621956910833065
     \]
   - Rounded to 10 decimal places, this is \(2.7621956911\).
