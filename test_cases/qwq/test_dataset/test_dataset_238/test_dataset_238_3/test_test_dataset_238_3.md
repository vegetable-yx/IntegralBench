To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x^{-1/2} \left[1 - \sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-5/2} \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: Let \(x = \sin^2 \theta\). This transforms the integral into a trigonometric form:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos \theta}{\left[1 - \sin \theta \cos \theta\right]^{5/2}} \, d\theta
   \]
   Further simplification using substitutions \(u = t - \frac{1}{2}\) and other algebraic manipulations leads to an expression involving standard integrals.

2. **Integration Steps**:
   - The integral is split into three parts and each part is integrated separately.
   - After evaluating each part and combining the results, the integral simplifies to:
     \[
     2 \left( I_1 + I_2 + I_3 \right)
     \]
   - Each term \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and \(I_3\) evaluates to \(2\), \(\frac{1}{3}\), and \(1\) respectively.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - Summing these results and multiplying by 2 gives:
     \[
     2 \left( 2 + \frac{1}{3} + 1 \right) = 2 \left( \frac{10}{3} \right) = \frac{20}{3}
     \]

4. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical approximation of the result is calculated to be approximately \(6.6666666667\).
