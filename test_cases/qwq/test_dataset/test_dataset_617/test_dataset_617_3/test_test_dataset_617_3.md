To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Split the integral using the cosine addition formula:
     \[
     \int_0^\pi \cos(x + \cos(x)) \, dx = \int_0^\pi \cos(x)\cos(\cos(x)) \, dx - \int_0^\pi \sin(x)\sin(\cos(x)) \, dx
     \]
   - Evaluate the second integral by substitution:
     - Let \(u = \cos(x)\), then \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\).
     - The integral becomes:
       \[
       -\int_0^\pi \sin(x)\sin(\cos(x)) \, dx = -\left[ -\cos(\cos(x)) \right]_0^\pi = 0
       \]
     - This simplifies to zero because \(\cos(\cos(\pi)) = \cos(-1) = \cos(1)\) and \(\cos(\cos(0)) = \cos(1)\).
   - Evaluate the first integral by substitution and symmetry:
     - Let \(t = \pi - x\), then the integral becomes:
       \[
       \int_0^\pi \cos(x)\cos(\cos(x)) \, dx = -\int_0^\pi \cos(t)\cos(\cos(t)) \, dt
       \]
     - This implies the integral is its own negative, hence zero.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral evaluates to exactly zero, so the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
