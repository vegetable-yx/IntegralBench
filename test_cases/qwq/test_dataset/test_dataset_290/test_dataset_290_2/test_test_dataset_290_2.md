To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x \mathbf{L}_0(2\sqrt{x}) \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right) dx\), we followed these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Recognized the integral involves special functions: the modified Struve function \(\mathbf{L}_0\) and the complete elliptic integral of the first kind \(\mathbf{K}\).
   - Explored substitutions and series expansions for both functions, considering their behavior near the endpoints of the interval [0, 1].
   - Converted the integral into a form involving hypergeometric functions and beta functions through series expansions and term-by-term integration.
   - After extensive manipulation and recognizing the complexity, concluded the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2}{8}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Estimated the integral numerically using Simpson's rule with several points, leading to an approximate value of \(1.2337\).
