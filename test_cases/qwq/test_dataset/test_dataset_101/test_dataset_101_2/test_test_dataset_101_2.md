To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{0.5} x \cdot (0.5^2 - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot \arcsin(0.5x) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( t = \arcsin(0.5x) \). This transforms the integral into a form involving elliptic integrals.
2. **Integration by Parts**: After several substitutions and integration by parts, the integral reduces to expressions involving elliptic integrals of the second kind.
3. **Elliptic Integrals**: The integral is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals \( E \) and \( F \), which are evaluated numerically due to their complexity in elementary functions.
4. **Numerical Approximation**: Using numerical integration techniques, the integral evaluates to approximately \( 0.0555041431 \).
