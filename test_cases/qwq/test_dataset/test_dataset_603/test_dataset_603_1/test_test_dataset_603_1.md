To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}}\:\mathrm{d}x\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Simplify the Integrand**:
   - The expression inside the square root is \(\sqrt{1 - \sin^2(x)} = |\cos(x)|\).
   - Therefore, the integrand becomes \(\frac{1}{1 + |\cos(x)|}\).

2. **Split the Integral**:
   - The integral is split into three parts where \(\cos(x)\) is positive and negative:
     - From \(0\) to \(\pi/2\), \(\cos(x)\) is positive.
     - From \(\pi/2\) to \(3\pi/2\), \(\cos(x)\) is negative.
     - From \(3\pi/2\) to \(2\pi\), \(\cos(x)\) is positive again.

3. **Compute Each Part**:
   - **First Integral (0 to \(\pi/2\))**:
     \[
     \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \:\mathrm{d}x
     \]
     Using the identity \(1 + \cos(x) = 2\cos^2(x/2)\), the integral simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \left[ \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right]_0^{\pi/2} = \frac{1}{2}(1 - 0) = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

   - **Second Integral (\(\pi/2\) to \(3\pi/2\))**:
     \[
     \int_{\pi/2}^{3\pi/2} \frac{1}{1 - \cos(x)} \:\mathrm{d}x
     \]
     Using the identity \(1 - \cos(x) = 2\sin^2(x/2)\), the integral simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\cot\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right]_{\pi/2}^{3\pi/2} = \frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1
     \]

   - **Third Integral (\(3\pi/2\) to \(2\pi\))**:
     \[
     \int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{1 + \cos(x)} \:\mathrm{d}x
     \]
     This is the same as the first integral, giving \(\frac{1}{2}\).

4. **Sum the Results**:
   - Adding the results of the three integrals:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2
     \]

5. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The exact result is \(2\), so the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is \(2.0000000000\).
