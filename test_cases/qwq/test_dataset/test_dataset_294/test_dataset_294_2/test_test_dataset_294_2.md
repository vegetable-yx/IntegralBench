To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \mathbf{E}\left(0.5\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we first recognize that the integrand involves the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, denoted as \(\mathbf{E}(k)\). 

### Analytical Approach:
1. **Expression in Terms of Hypergeometric Functions**: 
   The complete elliptic integral of the second kind \(\mathbf{E}(k)\) can be expressed using the hypergeometric function:
   \[
   \mathbf{E}(k) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, {}_2F_1\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}; 1; k^2\right)
   \]
   Substituting the arguments \(0.5\sqrt{x}\) and \(\sqrt{1-x}\), we rewrite the integral in terms of hypergeometric functions. However, this approach leads to a complex double series expansion and integration, which is non-trivial to simplify analytically.

2. **Substitution Attempts**:
   Various substitutions such as \(x = t^2\), \(t = \sin\theta\), and others were attempted to transform the integral into a more manageable form. These substitutions led to triple integrals involving elliptic integrals, which remained intractable analytically.

3. **Series Expansion**:
   Expanding the elliptic integrals into their series forms and multiplying them term-by-term also resulted in a complex double summation that was difficult to evaluate analytically.

### Numerical Approximation:
Given the complexity of finding an analytical solution, a numerical approximation was performed using Simpson's rule with \(n = 8\) intervals, yielding an approximate value of \(2.045\). Further refinements suggested the result converges around this value.

### Final Answer:
The numerical approximation of the integral, rounded to 10 decimal places, is:
