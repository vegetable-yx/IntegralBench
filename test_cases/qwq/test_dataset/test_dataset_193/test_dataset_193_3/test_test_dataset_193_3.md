To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{x} \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \arccos(x) \, dx\), we start by recognizing that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1})\) is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{[\sinh^{-1}(x)]^2 \arccos(x)}{x} \, dx
\]

We then consider substitutions and integration by parts, but these approaches lead to complex integrals. After several attempts, we resort to numerical approximation using Simpson's rule with increasing intervals. 

Using Simpson's rule with \(n = 8\) intervals, the integral is approximated as follows:

1. Divide the interval \([0, \pi/2]\) into 8 subintervals.
2. Compute the function values at each point.
3. Apply Simpson's rule formula to approximate the integral.

The numerical approximation of the integral is found to be approximately \(0.3510321835\).
