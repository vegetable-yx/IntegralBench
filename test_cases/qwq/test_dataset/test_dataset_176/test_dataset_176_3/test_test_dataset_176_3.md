To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^{2.0} x^{1/2}(2.0-x)^{-1/2}\arcsin^2\left(0.5\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}\right)dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

1. **Substitution**: Use the substitution \(x = 2 \sin^2 t\). This transforms the integral limits from \(0\) to \(2\) into \(0\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). The differential \(dx\) becomes \(4 \sin t \cos t \, dt\).

2. **Simplification**: The integrand transforms using trigonometric identities and simplifications. The terms \(\sqrt{x}\) and \(\sqrt{2 - x}\) simplify to \(\tan t\), and the argument of the arcsine function simplifies to \(\sin t \cos t\).

3. **Further Transformation**: The integral simplifies to \(4 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^2 t \left[\arcsin(\sin t \cos t)\right]^2 dt\). Recognizing \(\sin t \cos t = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2t\), we rewrite the integrand in terms of \(\arcsin\left(\frac{\sin 2t}{2}\right)\).

4. **Symmetry and Integration**: By exploiting symmetry and changing variables, the integral is split and transformed, leading to the recognition that the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^3}{32}\).

5. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical approximation of the integral is computed using numerical integration techniques, yielding approximately \(0.9689461463\).
