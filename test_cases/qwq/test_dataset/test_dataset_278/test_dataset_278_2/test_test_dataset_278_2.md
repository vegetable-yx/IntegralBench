To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{2 - x}} \cosh\left(\sqrt{x(2 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Analytical Solution**:
   - We use the substitution \(x = 2 \sin^2 \theta\), which transforms the integral into a more manageable form.
   - After substitution, the integral simplifies to \(2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \cosh(\sin 2\theta) \, d\theta\).
   - Further substitution and simplification using trigonometric identities and properties of Bessel functions show that the integral evaluates to \(\pi I_0(1)\), where \(I_0\) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The modified Bessel function \(I_0(1)\) is approximately \(1.26606587775200835\).
   - Multiplying this by \(\pi\) gives the numerical value \(3.9774628562\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.

The final answers are:

\[
\text{Exact Answer: } \pi I_0(1)
\]
\[
\text{Numerical Approximation: } 3.9774628562
\]
