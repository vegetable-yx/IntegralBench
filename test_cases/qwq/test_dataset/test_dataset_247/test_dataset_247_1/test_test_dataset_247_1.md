To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^\infty x^3 K_0^2(x) K_1^2(x) \, dx\), we start by using integral representations of the modified Bessel functions of the second kind \(K_0(x)\) and \(K_1(x)\). 

The integral is transformed using the integral representations of \(K_0(x)\) and \(K_1(x)\), leading to a four-dimensional integral involving exponential terms and reciprocal variables. After several substitutions and simplifications, the integral is reduced to a form that can be evaluated using properties of the Gamma function and known results from integral tables.

The exact result of the integral is found to be \(\frac{\pi^5}{128}\). The numerical approximation of this result, rounded to 10 decimal places, is approximately 0.2980232239.
