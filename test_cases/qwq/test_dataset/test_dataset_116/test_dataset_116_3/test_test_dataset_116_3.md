To calculate the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx\), we start by recognizing the integral involves complete elliptic integrals of the first kind, \(\mathbf{K}(k)\). 

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral can be transformed using substitutions and properties of elliptic integrals. Through careful analysis and referencing known integral results, it is found that the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^4}{64}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^4}{64}\) is computed using \(\pi \approx 3.141592653589793\), resulting in approximately 1.5220170474.

### Final Answer
