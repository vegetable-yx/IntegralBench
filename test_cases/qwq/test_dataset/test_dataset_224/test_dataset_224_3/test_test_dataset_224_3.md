To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x \ln\frac{1+x}{1-x} \ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{1-\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx\), we start by using the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin\theta \cos\theta \ln\left(\frac{1+\sin\theta}{1-\sin\theta}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1+\cos\theta}{1-\cos\theta}\right) \, d\theta
\]

Using properties of logarithms and hypergeometric functions, we simplify the integrand. Further substitutions and series expansions are considered, but due to complexity, we resort to numerical approximation and known integrals involving \(\pi^4\).

After detailed analysis and numerical approximation, the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^4}{72}\). The numerical approximation of this result is approximately 1.352904088.
