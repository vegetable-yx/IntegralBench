To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx\), we can use symmetry arguments:

1. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - Consider the substitution \(x = \pi - t\). When \(x\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\), \(t\) ranges from \(\pi\) to \(-\pi\).
   - The integral becomes:
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \tan(\cos(\pi - t)) \, dt
     \]
   - Using the identity \(\cos(\pi - t) = -\cos(t)\), we get \(\tan(\cos(\pi - t)) = \tan(-\cos(t)) = -\tan(\cos(t))\).
   - Therefore, the integral transforms to:
     \[
     \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} -\tan(\cos(t)) \, dt = -\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \tan(\cos(t)) \, dt
     \]
   - Since the original integral is over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\), which is equivalent to \([- \pi, \pi]\), we have:
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = -\int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx
     \]
   - This implies that the integral must be zero:
     \[
     \int_0^{2\pi} \tan(\cos(x)) \, dx = 0
     \]

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral evaluates to exactly zero due to symmetry, so the numerical approximation is \(0.0000000000\).
