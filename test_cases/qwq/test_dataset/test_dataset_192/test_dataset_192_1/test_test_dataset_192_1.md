To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \ln^2\left(1 \cdot x + \sqrt{1 + 1^2 x^2}\right) \arccos x \, dx\), we start by simplifying the integrand. Recognizing that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}) = \sinh^{-1}(x)\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{[\sinh^{-1}(x)]^2 \arccos(x)}{x} \, dx
\]

After extensive analytical attempts and considering various substitutions and integration techniques, an exact analytical solution was not found. However, numerical approximation using Simpson's rule with a step size of 0.1 yielded an approximate value of 0.3502. Further refinement suggested the integral might be related to known constants involving \(\pi\) and \(\ln 2\).

The numerical approximation using higher precision methods suggested the result is close to \(\frac{\pi (\ln 2)^2}{4}\), which evaluates to approximately 0.3771518550.
