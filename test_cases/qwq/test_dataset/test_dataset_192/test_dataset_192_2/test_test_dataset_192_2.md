To compute the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1\frac{1}{x}\ln^2\left(x+\sqrt{1+x^2}\right)\arccos x \,dx\), we start by recognizing that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2})\) is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, \(\sinh^{-1}(x)\). This simplifies the integrand to:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{[\sinh^{-1}(x)]^2 \arccos(x)}{x} \, dx
\]

We then consider substitutions and integration techniques, including integration by parts and series expansions. However, these approaches become complex. 

Using numerical integration with Simpson's rule for a higher number of intervals (16 intervals), we approximate the integral. The numerical result is approximately \(0.351\).

Considering the proximity of this numerical result to \(\frac{\pi^2}{28}\), which evaluates to approximately \(0.3524858714\), we hypothesize the exact answer is \(\frac{\pi^2}{28}\).
