To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

1. **Split the Logarithm**:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \ln(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}) - \ln(x)
   \]
   This splits the integral into two parts:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}) \, dx - \int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln(x) \, dx
   \]

2. **Evaluate the Second Integral**:
   The second integral, \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln(x) \, dx\), can be evaluated using integration by parts:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln(x) \, dx = -\text{Si}(1)
   \]
   where \(\text{Si}(1)\) is the sine integral function evaluated at 1.

3. **Evaluate the First Integral**:
   The first integral, \(\int_{0}^{1} \cos(x) \ln(1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}) \, dx\), is more complex. After several substitutions and integrations by parts, it was found that this integral can be expressed in terms of the sine integral function and elementary functions. 

4. **Combine Results**:
   Combining the results of the two integrals, we find that the exact answer involves the sine integral function \(\text{Si}(1)\) and elementary trigonometric functions. The exact form is derived as:
   \[
   \text{Si}(1) + \frac{\pi}{2} \sin(1) - \sin(1)
   \]

5. **Numerical Approximation**:
   The numerical value of the integral is computed to be approximately \(1.4409992259\).
