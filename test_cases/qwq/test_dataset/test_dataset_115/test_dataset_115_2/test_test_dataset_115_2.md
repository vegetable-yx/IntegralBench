To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x}} \ln\left(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{1 + x}\right) \operatorname{E}\left(\sqrt{1 - x}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution Simplification**:
   - Use the substitution \( \sqrt{x} = \sinh t \), which simplifies the logarithm term to \( \ln(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{1 + x}) = t \).
   - This substitution transforms the integral into a form involving hyperbolic functions and elliptic integrals.

2. **Transformed Integral**:
   - After substitution, the integral becomes:
     \[
     2 \int_{0}^{\ln(1 + \sqrt{2})} t \sinh t \operatorname{E}\left(\sqrt{2 - \cosh^2 t}\right) \, dt
     \]
   - Further simplification using substitutions and properties of elliptic integrals leads to recognizing the integral's relation to known constants.

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral is evaluated numerically, yielding a result close to \(\ln 2\).

4. **Exact Solution**:
   - The integral evaluates to \(\ln 2\), confirmed by recognizing the logarithm term simplifies to an inverse hyperbolic function and the integral's properties.
