To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 x \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}\right) \arccos x \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Recognize that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{1 + x^2}) = \sinh^{-1}(x)\).
   - Substitute \(t = \arccos(x)\), leading to \(x = \cos(t)\), \(dx = -\sin(t) dt\), and adjusting the limits of integration.

2. **Integral Transformation**:
   - Transform the integral into terms of \(t\) and simplify using trigonometric identities and properties of hyperbolic functions.
   - Recognize the symmetry and relationship between the integrals involving \(\sinh^{-1}(\cos(t))\) and \(\sinh^{-1}(\sin(t))\).

3. **Integration by Parts and Substitutions**:
   - Use integration by parts and substitutions to handle the complex integrand.
   - Compute the integral \(I_1 = \int_0^1 x [\sinh^{-1}(x)]^2 \, dx\) and recognize its relationship to the original integral.

4. **Exact Expression**:
   - Derive the exact form of the integral using the computed \(I_1\) and the relationship between the integrals.

5. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Calculate the numerical value of the exact expression using the natural logarithm and constants.
