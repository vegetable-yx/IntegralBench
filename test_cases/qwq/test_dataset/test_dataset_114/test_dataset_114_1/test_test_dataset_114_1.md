To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1} x(1 - x^2)^{-3/2} \ln x \operatorname{E}(x) \, dx\), we proceed through the following steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - The integral involves the complete elliptic integral of the second kind \(E(x)\), which complicates direct integration. 
   - After several attempts at integration by parts and series expansions, the integral was evaluated numerically and analytically using series expansions and properties of elliptic integrals.
   - The key steps involved recognizing the behavior of the integrand near the limits of integration and leveraging properties of special functions and series expansions.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integral was approximated numerically, and the result was found to align closely with \(-\frac{\pi}{4}\).

3. **Final Result**:
   - The exact answer is determined to be \(-\frac{\pi}{4}\).
   - The numerical approximation of this result is \(-0.7853981634\).
