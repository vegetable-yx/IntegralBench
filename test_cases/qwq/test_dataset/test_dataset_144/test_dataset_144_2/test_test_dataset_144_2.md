To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^2 \arccos(x) I_0(2x) \, dx\), we followed these steps:

1. **Analytical Approach**:
   - Expanded the integrand using the series expansion of the modified Bessel function \(I_0(2x)\).
   - Expressed the integral as an infinite series and computed each term analytically.
   - Derived the series expression for the integral involving factorials and Bessel functions.

2. **Steps and Simplifications**:
   - Used integration by parts and substitutions to simplify the integral.
   - Derived the series terms by evaluating integrals of the form \(\int_0^1 x^{2n+2} \arccos(x) \, dx\).
   - Recognized the series expression as a combination of factorials and terms involving \(4^n\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - Computed the first few terms of the series and summed them to approximate the integral.
   - The series converges to approximately \(0.3465277196\).

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The exact answer is expressed as an infinite series involving factorials and Bessel functions.
   - The numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is \(0.3465277196\).
