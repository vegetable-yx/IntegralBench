To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^2 x^{(2 \cdot 1 - 1)/4}(2 - x)^{0.5/2}J_{1 - 0.5}(1 \cdot \sqrt{x})J_{0.5}(1 \cdot \sqrt{2 - x}) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Simplify the integrand**:
   - The exponents simplify to \(x^{1/4}\) and \((2 - x)^{1/4}\).
   - The Bessel functions \(J_{0.5}(z)\) can be expressed using the known formula \(J_{1/2}(z) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} \sin(z)\).

2. **Substitution**:
   - Substitute \(x = 2t\), transforming the integral into a form involving \(t\) from 0 to 1. This results in terms involving \(\sqrt{2t}\) and \(\sqrt{2(1 - t)}\).

3. **Simplify using Bessel function identities**:
   - The product of Bessel functions simplifies to terms involving \(\sin(\sqrt{2t})\) and \(\sin(\sqrt{2(1 - t)})\).

4. **Further simplification**:
   - The integral reduces to \(\frac{4}{\pi} \int_0^1 \sin(\sqrt{2t}) \sin(\sqrt{2(1 - t)}) \, dt\).

5. **Evaluate the integral**:
   - The integral \(\int_0^1 \sin(\sqrt{2t}) \sin(\sqrt{2(1 - t)}) \, dt\) is evaluated numerically and analytically, leading to the result \(\frac{\pi}{2^{5/2}}\).

6. **Final result**:
   - Multiplying the result by \(\frac{4}{\pi}\) gives \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
