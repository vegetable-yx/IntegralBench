The integral is split into three parts: \(\int_0^6 x \, dx\), \(\int_0^6 (x - 3)^7 \, dx\), and \(\int_0^6 \sin(x - 3) \, dx\).

1. **Integral of \(x\):**
   \[
   \int_0^6 x \, dx = \left[ \frac{1}{2}x^2 \right]_0^6 = \frac{1}{2}(6^2) - \frac{1}{2}(0^2) = 18.
   \]

2. **Integral of \((x - 3)^7\):**
   Substitute \(u = x - 3\), \(du = dx\). The limits become \(u = -3\) to \(u = 3\):
   \[
   \int_{-3}^{3} u^7 \, du = \left[ \frac{1}{8}u^8 \right]_{-3}^{3} = \frac{1}{8}(3^8 - (-3)^8) = 0.
   \]
   Since \((-3)^8 = 3^8\), the result is zero due to symmetry.

3. **Integral of \(\sin(x - 3)\):**
   Substitute \(v = x - 3\), \(dv = dx\). The limits become \(v = -3\) to \(v = 3\):
   \[
   \int_{-3}^{3} \sin(v) \, dv = \left[ -\cos(v) \right]_{-3}^{3} = -\cos(3) + \cos(-3) = 0.
   \]
   Since \(\cos(-3) = \cos(3)\), the result is zero due to symmetry.

**Summing all parts:**
\[
18 + 0 + 0 = 18.
\]

The numerical approximation is \(18.0000000000\).
