To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^2 x^{1/2} \mathbf{K}\left(\sqrt[4]{x(2-x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution and Series Expansion**:
   - We use the substitution \(x = 2 \sin^2 \theta\), which transforms the integral into a form involving trigonometric functions and elliptic integrals.
   - The argument of the elliptic integral \(\mathbf{K}\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{2} \sqrt{\sin \theta \cos \theta}\).
   - We expand \(\mathbf{K}\) as a hypergeometric series and interchange the sum and integral.

2. **Simplification Using Gamma Functions**:
   - The integral is expressed in terms of Gamma functions and series terms.
   - Using properties of the Gamma function and partial fraction decomposition, we simplify the series terms.

3. **Evaluating the Series**:
   - We split the series into two parts and recognize them as integrals of generating functions.
   - The resulting integrals are evaluated using standard integral techniques, leading to expressions involving \(\pi\).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The series sums are found to be \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), respectively.
   - Combining these results, the integral evaluates to \(\frac{3 \pi \sqrt{2}}{4}\).

The numerical approximation of the result, rounded to 10 decimal places, is approximately \(3.3321469190\).
