Wait, the user requires an exact answer in LaTeX. Since I couldn't find an analytical form, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me think again.

Wait, going back to the substitution x = 3 sin²θ, then sqrt(x(3−x)) = 3 sinθ cosθ,

The integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(3) sinθ * cosh(2*3 sinθ cosθ) * 6 sinθ cosθ dθ.

Wait, let me recheck:

Wait, when x = 3 sin²θ,

dx = 6 sinθ cosθ dθ,

sqrt(x) = sqrt(3) sinθ,

sqrt(x(3−x)) = sqrt(3 sin²θ * 3 cos²θ)=3 sinθ cosθ,

so the argument inside cosh is 2*3 sinθ cosθ = 3 sin2θ,

Thus, the integral becomes:

∫₀^{π/2} sqrt(3) sinθ * cosh(3 sin2θ) *6 sinθ cosθ dθ

=6 sqrt(3) ∫₀^{π/2} sin²θ cosθ cosh(3 sin2θ) dθ

Let me set φ = 2θ, so θ = φ/2, dθ = dφ/2,

Limits become φ=0 to φ=π,

Thus,

3 sqrt(3) ∫₀^π sin²(φ/2) cos(φ/2) cosh(3 sinφ) dφ

Hmm, perhaps this can be expressed as a Bessel function integral.

Recall that:

∫₀^π e^{a sinφ} cos(bφ) dφ = 2 I_b(a)

But here we have cosh(3 sinφ)= (e^{3 sinφ} + e^{-3 sinφ})/2,

and multiplied by sin²(φ/2) cos(φ/2).

Let me express sin²(φ/2)= (1 -cosφ)/2,

Thus,

3 sqrt(3) * ½ ∫₀^π (1 -cosφ) cos(φ/2) cosh(3 sinφ) dφ

= (3 sqrt(3)/2)[ ∫₀^π cos(φ/2) cosh(3 sinφ) dφ - ∫₀^π cosφ cos(φ/2) cosh(3 sinφ) dφ ]

These integrals might be expressed in terms of Bessel functions.

Consider the first integral:

∫₀^π cos(φ/2) cosh(3 sinφ) dφ = ½ [ ∫₀^π cos(φ/2) e^{3 sinφ} dφ + ∫₀^π cos(φ/2) e^{-3 sinφ} dφ ]

Similarly for the second integral.

But I'm not sure about the exact form.

However, given the numerical value and the problem's requirement for an exact answer, perhaps the integral evaluates to 3√3 π I₀(3)/2.

Let me compute that:

3√3 π I₀(3)/2 ≈3*1.732*3.1416*5.355/2≈(8.082*5.355)/2≈43.3/2≈21.65, which is close to the numerical value of ~22.49.

Alternatively, maybe it's 3√3 times something.

Alternatively, given the time invested and the numerical approximation, I'll proceed with the numerical answer as instructed.

Final Answer:
\boxed{22.49468445}

Wait, the user requires the exact answer in LaTeX. Since I can't find it analytically and the problem might expect a specific form, perhaps I missed a step.

Wait, let me think of the substitution t = sqrt(x). Let me try that again.

Let t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt,

Integral becomes ∫₀^{√3} t * cosh(2 sqrt(t²(3 - t²))) * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀^{√3} t² cos
