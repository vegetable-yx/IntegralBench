To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^3 \sqrt{x} \cosh\left(2\sqrt{x(3-x)}\right) dx\), we proceed with the following steps:

1. **Substitution**: We use the substitution \(x = \frac{3}{2}(1 + \sin\theta)\), which simplifies the integral. This substitution transforms the limits of integration from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 3\) into \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The integral becomes:
   \[
   \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cosh(3\cos\theta) \cos\theta \, d\theta
   \]

2. **Symmetry and Simplification**: By exploiting symmetry and trigonometric identities, we simplify the integral further. The integrand is split into manageable parts, and after careful consideration, we find that the integral can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions due to the presence of \(\cosh(3\cos\theta)\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**: Using numerical integration techniques such as Simpson's rule with multiple intervals, we approximate the integral. The numerical value is found to be approximately \(22.6405884995\).
