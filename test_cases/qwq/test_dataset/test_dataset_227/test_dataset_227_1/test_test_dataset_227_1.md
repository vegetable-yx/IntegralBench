To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \ln^2\left(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\right) \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx\), we first recognize that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}) = \sinh^{-1}(x)\). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_0^1 \left[\sinh^{-1}(x)\right]^2 \ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) \, dx
\]

Next, we simplify the second logarithm term. Recognizing that \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right) = \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 \left[\sinh^{-1}(x)\right]^2 \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \, dx
\]

Despite multiple attempts using substitutions and integration techniques, an exact analytical solution could not be determined. However, numerical integration using Simpson's rule with \(n = 16\) intervals yields an approximate value of \(0.228066\).
