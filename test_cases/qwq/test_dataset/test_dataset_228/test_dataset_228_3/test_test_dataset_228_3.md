To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1\ln^2\left(x+\sqrt{x^2+1}\right)\ln\frac{1+\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}\,dx\), we start by simplifying the integrand using known substitutions and transformations.

1. **Substitution Analysis**:
   - Recognize that \(\ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 + 1}) = \sinh^{-1}(x)\).
   - Use the substitution \(x = \sin\theta\), transforming the integral into trigonometric terms.
   - Further simplification shows the logarithmic term \(\ln\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x}\right)\) becomes \(\ln(\cot(\theta/2))\).

2. **Integration by Parts**:
   - After multiple substitutions and integration by parts attempts, the integral is transformed into a form that can be evaluated numerically.
   - Numerical approximation using Simpson's rule with several intervals provides an approximate value.

3. **Exact Answer Conjecture**:
   - The integral is conjectured to be \(\frac{\pi^3 (\ln 2)^2}{64}\) based on the numerical approximation and known constants.
