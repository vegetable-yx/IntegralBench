To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{5+\sqrt{24}}\right) dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Integration**:
   - Recognize that \(a = 5 + \sqrt{24}\) and \(b = 5 - \sqrt{24}\) are reciprocals (\(a \cdot b = 1\)).
   - Use integration by parts with \(u = \arctan(x^a)\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx\).
   - Calculate the boundary term and the remaining integral.
   - Substitute \(x = t^{1/a}\) in the remaining integral to transform it into an integral involving \(b\).
   - Use the identity \(\arctan(x^a) + \arctan(x^b) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) to relate the integrals involving \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Key Steps**:
   - Integration by parts gives \(J = \frac{\pi^2}{16} - J'\), where \(J'\) is the integral with exponent \(b\).
   - Recognize that \(J + J' = \frac{\pi^2}{8}\) due to the identity \(\arctan(z) + \arctan(1/z) = \frac{\pi}{2}\).
   - Solve the system of equations to find \(J = \frac{\pi^2}{32}\).

3. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical approximation of \(\frac{\pi^2}{32}\) is calculated to be approximately 0.3084251374.
