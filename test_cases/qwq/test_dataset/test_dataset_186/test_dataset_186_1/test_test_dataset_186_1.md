To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{5+\sqrt{24}}\right) \, dx\), we start by noting that \(5 + \sqrt{24} = (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})^2\). Let \(a = (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})^2\) and \(b = (\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2})^2\), which are reciprocals since \(a \cdot b = 1\).

Using integration by parts with \(u = \arctan(x^a)\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx\), we find:

\[
I = \left[ \arctan(x) \arctan(x^a) \right]_0^1 - \int_0^1 \arctan(x) \cdot \frac{a x^{a-1}}{1 + x^{2a}} \, dx
\]

Evaluating the boundary terms gives \(\frac{\pi^2}{16}\). The remaining integral is related to another integral \(K\), leading to:

\[
I = \frac{\pi^2}{16} - aK
\]

where \(K = \frac{1}{a} \int_0^1 \frac{\arctan(t^{1/a})}{1 + t^2} \, dt\). Recognizing the symmetry between \(a\) and \(b\), we find that \(I + I_b = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\) where \(I_b\) is the integral with \(a\) replaced by \(b\). By symmetry and the reciprocal relationship, \(I = I_b\), leading to:

\[
2I = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \implies I = \frac{\pi^2}{32}
\]

Numerically, this evaluates to approximately \(0.3084251376\).
