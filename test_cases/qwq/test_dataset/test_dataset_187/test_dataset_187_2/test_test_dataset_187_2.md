To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{11+\sqrt{120}}\right) \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Analytical Calculation**:
   - Let \(a = 11 + \sqrt{120}\) and note that \(b = 11 - \sqrt{120}\) is the reciprocal of \(a\) (since \((11 + \sqrt{120})(11 - \sqrt{120}) = 1\)).
   - Using integration by parts and substitution, we derive the relationship \(I(a) + I(b) = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\), where \(I(a)\) is the integral with exponent \(a\) and \(I(b)\) is the integral with exponent \(b\).
   - By symmetry and the reciprocal relationship between \(a\) and \(b\), we find that \(I(a) = I(b)\). This leads to \(2I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\), hence \(I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{32}\).

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{32}\) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{\pi^2}{32} \approx \frac{9.869604401089358}{32} \approx 0.3084251375
     \]
