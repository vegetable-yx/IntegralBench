To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \arctan\left(x^{11+\sqrt{120}}\right) dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Recognize the integral's symmetry**:
   - Let \(a = 11 + \sqrt{120}\) and \(b = \frac{1}{a} = 11 - \sqrt{120}\).
   - Note that \(a \cdot b = 1\), which is crucial for the symmetry argument.

2. **Use substitution and integration by parts**:
   - By substituting \(t = x^a\), we transformed the integral and found a relationship between the integrals \(I(a)\) and \(I(b)\).
   - Using integration by parts and substitution, we derived the key relation \(I(a) + I(b) = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\).

3. **Leverage symmetry**:
   - Since \(a\) and \(b\) are reciprocals, we argued that \(I(a) = I(b)\) due to the symmetry in the integral's structure.
   - This symmetry leads to \(2I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{16}\), hence \(I(a) = \frac{\pi^2}{32}\).

4. **Numerical approximation**:
   - The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{32}\) is approximately \(0.3084251375\) when rounded to 10 decimal places.
