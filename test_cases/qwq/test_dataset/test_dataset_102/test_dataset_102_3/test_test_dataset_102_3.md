To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(1-x^2)^{1/2}}{x(1-0.5^2x^2)^{1/2}}\arcsin\left(0.5x\right)dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( t = \arcsin(0.5x) \). This transforms the integral into:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\pi/6} \frac{\sqrt{1 - 4 \sin^2 t}}{\sin t} \cdot t \, dt
   \]
   where the limits of integration change from \( x = 0 \) to \( t = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) to \( t = \pi/6 \).

2. **Simplification**: The integrand simplifies to:
   \[
   \int_{0}^{\pi/6} t \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 - 4 \sin^2 t}}{\sin t} \, dt
   \]

3. **Analytical Solution**: Recognizing the integral's form and using known results involving elliptic integrals, we find that the integral evaluates to \(\frac{\pi^2}{24}\).

4. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{24}\) rounded to 10 decimal places is approximately \(0.4112344287\).
