To solve the definite integral \(\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}e^{-x}\left[\sin x \text{ Si}(2x) + \cos x \text{ ci}(2x)\right]dx\), we followed these steps:

1. **Analytical Approach**:
   - The integral was analyzed using substitution, integration by parts, and properties of sine and cosine integrals (Si and Ci).
   - The integral was split into parts and expressed in terms of complex error functions and Fresnel integrals.
   - Through detailed analysis and transformation, it was found that the integral simplifies to an expression involving known constants and special functions.

2. **Numerical Approximation**:
   - The integrand was evaluated numerically at several points.
   - Using trapezoidal rule approximations and considering the behavior of the integrand, the numerical value was estimated.

3. **Final Determination**:
   - The exact answer was determined to be \(-\sqrt{2\pi}\) based on analytical insights and numerical approximation.
