To solve the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^{-1/4}(1-x)^{1/4}\left[1 - \sqrt{x(1-x)}\right]^{-2} \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( t = \sqrt{\frac{x}{1-x}} \). This transforms the integral into a form that can be expressed using the Beta function.
2. **Transformation**: After substitution, the integral becomes:
   \[
   2 \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{1/2}}{(t^2 - t + 1)^2} \, dt
   \]
3. **Series Expansion**: Expand the integrand using a binomial series and interchange summation and integration. This leads to a series involving the Beta function.
4. **Gamma Function Properties**: Using properties of the Gamma function and its duplication formula, the series is simplified.
5. **Summation**: The series is evaluated to find that it sums to \(\pi\).

The exact answer is \(\pi\), and the numerical approximation is obtained by evaluating \(\pi\) to 10 decimal places.
