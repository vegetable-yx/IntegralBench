To solve the definite integral \(\int_{0}^{2.0} \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{2.0 - x}} \arcsin\left(0.5 \sqrt{x(2.0 - x)}\right) \, dx\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Substitution**: Let \(x = 2 \sin^2 \theta\). This transforms the integral limits from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 2\) into \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\). The integral becomes:
   \[
   4 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^2 \theta \arcsin\left(\frac{\sin 2\theta}{2}\right) \, d\theta
   \]

2. **Simplification**: Using symmetry and substitution, the integral simplifies to:
   \[
   2 \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \arcsin\left(\frac{\sin \phi}{2}\right) \, d\phi
   \]
   where \(\phi = 2\theta\).

3. **Integration by Parts**: Let \(J = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \arcsin\left(\frac{\sin \phi}{2}\right) \, d\phi\). Through integration by parts and substitution, we find that \(J = \frac{\pi^2}{12}\).

4. **Final Result**: The original integral is twice \(J\), leading to:
   \[
   I = 2J = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{12} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
   \]

5. **Numerical Approximation**: The numerical value of \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\) rounded to 10 decimal places is approximately \(1.6449340668\).
