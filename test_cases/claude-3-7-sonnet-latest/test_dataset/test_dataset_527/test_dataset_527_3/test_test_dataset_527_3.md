# Evaluating $\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos x)\:dx$

I'll calculate this definite integral through careful analysis.

## Step 1: Analyzing the integral

Let's denote the integral as:
$$I = \int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos x)\:dx$$

First, I'll make a substitution to simplify this. Let $u = \pi - x$. Then:
- When $x = 0$, $u = \pi$
- When $x = \pi$, $u = 0$
- $dx = -du$

Substituting:
$$I = \int_\pi^0\cos((\pi-u)+\cos(\pi-u))(-du)$$
$$I = \int_0^\pi\cos(\pi-u+\cos(\pi-u))du$$

Using trigonometric identities:
- $\cos(\pi-u) = -\cos(u)$

Therefore:
$$I = \int_0^\pi\cos(\pi-u-\cos(u))du$$
$$I = \int_0^\pi\cos(\pi-(u+\cos(u)))du$$

Using the identity $\cos(\pi-\theta) = -\cos(\theta)$:
$$I = \int_0^\pi-\cos(u+\cos(u))du$$
$$I = -\int_0^\pi\cos(u+\cos(u))du$$

But this is just $-I$. So:
$$I = -I$$
$$2I = 0$$
$$I = 0$$

## Step 2: Verification

To verify this result, I observe that we've shown $I = -I$, which is only possible when $I = 0$.

Another way to see this is that $\cos(x+\cos x)$ is not an even or odd function, but our substitution revealed a symmetry that causes the integral to vanish over the interval $[0,\pi]$.

## Step 3: Numerical approximation

The exact value is 0, so the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is:
$$0.0000000000$$
