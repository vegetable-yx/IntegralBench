# Evaluating $\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))\mathrm{~}dx$

## Step 1: Let's analyze the integral

First, I'll examine the properties of this integral. The integrand is $\tan(\cos(x))$ over the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

Note that $\cos(x)$ is an even function, and $\cos(2\pi-x) = \cos(x)$.

Also, $\tan(y)$ is an odd function, meaning $\tan(-y) = -\tan(y)$.

## Step 2: Analyze the behavior over the interval

Let's consider what happens in the interval $[\pi, 2\pi]$:
For $x \in [\pi, 2\pi]$, we can substitute $u = 2\pi - x$, which gives $u \in [0, \pi]$.

When we make this substitution:
$\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(2\pi-u))(-du)$

Since $\cos(2\pi-u) = \cos(u)$, we get:
$\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = -\int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(u))du$

## Step 3: Combine the integrals

The original integral can be split as:
$\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_0^{\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx$

Substituting the result from Step 2:
$\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_0^{\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx - \int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(u))du = 0$

## Step 4: Verification

We can verify this result by noting that $\tan(\cos(x))$ is an odd function with respect to $x = \pi$, meaning $\tan(\cos(\pi+x)) = -\tan(\cos(\pi-x))$. When integrated over a symmetric interval around $\pi$, such as $[0, 2\pi]$, the result is zero.

## Final Answer

The definite integral $\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = 0$

The numerical approximation is simply 0.0000000000 (to 10 decimal places).
