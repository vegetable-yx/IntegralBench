# Evaluating $\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))\mathrm{~}dx$

## Step 1: Analyze the integral

First, I'll examine the function $f(x) = \tan(\cos(x))$ over the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

Notice that $\cos(x)$ is an even function and $\cos(2\pi-x) = \cos(x)$ for all $x$. This means that $\tan(\cos(2\pi-x)) = \tan(\cos(x))$.

## Step 2: Consider symmetry properties

Let's analyze the behavior of $\tan(\cos(x))$ in the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

For $x \in [0, \pi]$, $\cos(x)$ decreases from 1 to -1.
For $x \in [\pi, 2\pi]$, $\cos(x)$ increases from -1 to 1.

Since $\tan(\cos(x))$ depends only on $\cos(x)$, and $\cos(x)$ is symmetric around $x = \pi$, we need to check if $\tan(\cos(x))$ is even or odd with respect to $x = \pi$.

Let $y = x - \pi$. Then:
$\tan(\cos(x)) = \tan(\cos(y + \pi)) = \tan(-\cos(y)) = -\tan(\cos(y))$

This means that $\tan(\cos(x))$ is odd with respect to $x = \pi$.

## Step 3: Apply symmetry to simplify the integral

Since $\tan(\cos(x))$ is odd with respect to $x = \pi$ over the interval $[0, 2\pi]$, we have:
$\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_0^{\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx$

With the substitution $u = x - \pi$ in the second integral:
$\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(u+\pi))du = \int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(-\cos(u))du = -\int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(u))du$

Therefore:
$\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = \int_0^{\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx - \int_{0}^{\pi}\tan(\cos(u))du = 0$

## Step 4: Verification

We can verify this result by considering that $\tan(\cos(x))$ is an odd function with respect to $x = \pi$ over a symmetric interval $[0, 2\pi]$, which means the integral must be zero.

## Final Answer

The definite integral $\int_0^{2\pi}\tan(\cos(x))dx = 0$ exactly.

The numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
