# Evaluating $\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx$

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand and its properties

The function $f(x) = \lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor$ contains the floor function, which makes a direct integration challenging. However, we can use properties of periodic functions and symmetry.

First, I'll note that $\sin(x)$ has a period of $2\pi$, and its range is $[-1,1]$. This means that $2023\sin(x)$ has a range of $[-2023,2023]$.

## Step 2: Use symmetry of sine function

For a definite integral over $[0,2\pi]$, we can use the symmetry of sine:
- $\sin(x) = \sin(\pi-x)$ (symmetry about $x=\pi/2$)
- $\sin(x+\pi) = -\sin(x)$ (odd function with respect to half-period)

## Step 3: Split the integral

Let's split the integral into two parts:
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = \int_0^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx$$

For $x \in [\pi,2\pi]$, we can substitute $u = x-\pi$, which gives:
$$\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = \int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(u+\pi)\rfloor du = \int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor-2023\sin(u)\rfloor du$$

## Step 4: Apply floor function property

For any real number $y$, we know that $\lfloor-y\rfloor = -\lceil y\rceil = -\lfloor y\rfloor - 1$ when $y$ is not an integer.

Since $2023\sin(u)$ is typically not an integer (except at specific points), we have:
$$\lfloor-2023\sin(u)\rfloor = -\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor - 1$$

Therefore:
$$\int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor-2023\sin(u)\rfloor du = \int_{0}^{\pi}(-\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor - 1) du = -\int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor du - \int_{0}^{\pi}1 du$$

$$\int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor-2023\sin(u)\rfloor du = -\int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor du - \pi$$

## Step 5: Combine the results

Going back to our original split integral:
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = \int_0^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx$$

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = \int_0^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx + \left(-\int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor du - \pi\right)$$

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = \int_0^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx - \int_{0}^{\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(u)\rfloor du - \pi$$

Since the variables $x$ and $u$ are just dummy variables of integration, the first two integrals cancel out:

$$\int_0^{2\pi}\lfloor2023\sin(x)\rfloor dx = -\pi$$

## Step 6: Verify the result

This result makes sense because the floor function introduces a negative bias, and due to the symmetry of sine over a full period, we get a negative value. The exact answer is $-\pi$.
