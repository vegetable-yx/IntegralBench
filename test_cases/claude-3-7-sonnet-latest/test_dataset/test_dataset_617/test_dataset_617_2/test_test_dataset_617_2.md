# Evaluating $\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x$

## Step 1: Examine the structure of the integral

The integral $\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x$ doesn't have an obvious antiderivative that we can compute directly. Let's try to use symmetry properties to simplify it.

## Step 2: Make a substitution $u = \pi - x$

Let's substitute $u = \pi - x$, which means $x = \pi - u$ and $dx = -du$.

When $x = 0$, $u = \pi$
When $x = \pi$, $u = 0$

This gives us:
$$\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x = -\int_\pi^0\cos((\pi-u)+\cos(\pi-u))\mathrm{d}u$$
$$= \int_0^\pi\cos((\pi-u)+\cos(\pi-u))\mathrm{d}u$$

Now, we know that $\cos(\pi-u) = -\cos(u)$, so:
$$\int_0^\pi\cos((\pi-u)+\cos(\pi-u))\mathrm{d}u = \int_0^\pi\cos(\pi-u-\cos(u))\mathrm{d}u$$

We also know that $\cos(\pi-\theta) = -\cos(\theta)$, so:
$$\int_0^\pi\cos(\pi-u-\cos(u))\mathrm{d}u = \int_0^\pi-\cos(u+\cos(u))\mathrm{d}u = -\int_0^\pi\cos(u+\cos(u))\mathrm{d}u$$

## Step 3: Derive the value from symmetry

We've shown that:
$$\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x = -\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x$$

This is only possible if:
$$\int_0^\pi\cos(x+\cos(x))\mathrm{d}x = 0$$

## Step 4: Verify the result

We can verify this result by considering the symmetry of the function. The substitution we made showed that the integral equals its own negative, which is only possible if the integral equals zero.

## Numerical Approximation
The exact value of the integral is 0, so the numerical approximation is 0.0000000000.
