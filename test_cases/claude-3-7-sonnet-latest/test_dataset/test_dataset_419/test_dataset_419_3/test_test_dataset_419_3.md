# Evaluating $\int_0^\infty\frac{x}{e^x-1}\text{ dx}$

## Step 1: Identify a useful substitution or technique
Let's first recognize that this integral involves the function $\frac{x}{e^x-1}$, which appears in the context of Bose-Einstein statistics and is related to the polylogarithm functions.

I'll use the fact that this integral can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function.

## Step 2: Use the relation to the zeta function
For positive real $s > 1$, we have the following integral representation of the Riemann zeta function:
$$\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$

Where $\Gamma(s)$ is the gamma function.

## Step 3: Apply this relation to our integral
In our case, we have $\frac{x}{e^x-1}$, which corresponds to $\frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}$ with $s = 2$.

Therefore:
$$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{x}{e^x-1}dx = \Gamma(2)\zeta(2)$$

## Step 4: Evaluate the gamma and zeta functions
We know that:
- $\Gamma(2) = 1!= 1$
- $\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$

## Step 5: Compute the final result
$$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{x}{e^x-1}dx = 1 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

## Numerical approximation
$\frac{\pi^2}{6} \approx 1.6449340668$ (rounded to 10 decimal places)
