# Evaluating $\int\limits_{0}^{1}\arccos x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx$

First, I need to understand what $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ represents. $\mathbf{D}(x)$ is the Dirichlet function, which is defined as:

$\mathbf{D}(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
0 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}
\end{cases}$

## Step 1: Analyzing the integral with the Dirichlet function

The Dirichlet function is not Riemann integrable on any interval. This means that the given definite integral cannot be evaluated using standard calculus methods.

However, we can approach this using Lebesgue integration theory.

## Step 2: Applying Lebesgue integration

For any reasonable function $f(x)$, the integral of $f(x)$ multiplied by the Dirichlet function is:

$\int f(x) \mathbf{D}(x) dx = 0$

This is because the Dirichlet function equals 1 only on rational numbers, which form a set of measure zero in the Lebesgue sense.

## Step 3: Applying to our specific integral

In our case, the function $0.5x$ maps rational numbers to rational numbers and irrational numbers to irrational numbers. Therefore, $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ behaves the same way as $\mathbf{D}(x)$ for Lebesgue integration purposes.

Thus:
$\int\limits_{0}^{1}\arccos x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx = 0$

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact value is 0, so the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
