# Evaluating $\int\limits_{0}^{1}\arccos x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx$

## Step 1: Understand the integrand
In this integral, we have $\arccos x$ multiplied by $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$, where $\mathbf{D}$ refers to the Dirichlet function (also known as the indicator function for rational numbers):

$$\mathbf{D}(x) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
0 & \text{if } x \notin \mathbb{Q}
\end{cases}$$

## Step 2: Analyze the properties of $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$
For any real number $x$, $0.5x$ is rational if and only if $x$ is rational. This means:
- If $x$ is rational, then $\mathbf{D}(0.5x) = 1$
- If $x$ is irrational, then $\mathbf{D}(0.5x) = 0$

Since the rational numbers have Lebesgue measure zero, the function $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ equals zero almost everywhere on the interval $[0,1]$.

## Step 3: Apply integration principles
When integrating with respect to Lebesgue measure, functions that differ only on a set of measure zero have the same integral. Since $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ equals 0 almost everywhere, we can replace it with the constant function 0 for integration purposes.

Therefore:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{1}\arccos x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx = \int\limits_{0}^{1}\arccos x \cdot 0 \, dx = 0$$

## Step 4: Verify the result
This is consistent with the fact that when integrating a bounded function multiplied by a function that is zero almost everywhere, the result is zero.

## Numerical approximation
The numerical value of the integral is exactly 0, so rounded to 10 decimal places:
$$0.0000000000$$
