# Evaluating $\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x)-x)\text{ dx}$

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand
Let's denote the integrand as $f(x) = \sin(\sin(x)-x)$.

First, I'll examine the periodicity of this function. Since $\sin(x)$ has period $2\pi$, we need to check if $f(x+2\pi) = f(x)$:

$f(x+2\pi) = \sin(\sin(x+2\pi)-(x+2\pi)) = \sin(\sin(x)-x-2\pi)$

Since $\sin(θ-2\pi) = \sin(θ)$, we have:
$f(x+2\pi) = \sin(\sin(x)-x) = f(x)$

So the function has period $2\pi$.

## Step 2: Use properties of odd functions
Let's check if the function is odd or even on $[0,2\pi]$:

$f(-x) = \sin(\sin(-x)-(-x)) = \sin(-\sin(x)+x) = -\sin(\sin(x)-x) = -f(x)$

So $f(x)$ is an odd function. Since we're integrating an odd function over a symmetric interval $[0,2\pi]$ around the origin (which is equivalent to $[-\pi,\pi]$ for a $2\pi$-periodic function), the integral must be zero.

## Step 3: Verify with another approach
We can also use a substitution $u = x - \pi$ to shift our interval to $[-\pi,\pi]$:

$\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x)-x)dx = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin(\sin(u+\pi)-(u+\pi))du$

Since $\sin(u+\pi) = -\sin(u)$ and $u+\pi$ differs from $u$ by a constant:

$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin(-\sin(u)-(u+\pi))du = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin(-\sin(u)-u-\pi)du$

Using $\sin(θ-\pi) = -\sin(θ)$:

$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin(-\sin(u)-u-\pi)du = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}-\sin(-\sin(u)-u)du$

Since $-\sin(-θ) = -\sin(θ)$:

$\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}-\sin(-\sin(u)-u)du = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}-\sin(\sin(u)-u)du = -\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin(\sin(u)-u)du$

So the integral equals its own negative, which means it must be zero.

## Result
Therefore, $\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(\sin(x)-x)dx = 0$

The numerical approximation is $0.0000000000$ (to 10 decimal places).
