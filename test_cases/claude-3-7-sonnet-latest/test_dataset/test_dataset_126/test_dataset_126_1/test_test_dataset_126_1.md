# Calculating the definite integral $\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac1{1-0.5^2x}\:\mathbf{E}(0.5\sqrt{x})\:\mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1-x})\:dx$

I'll solve this integral involving the complete elliptic integrals $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{K}$.

## Step 1: Identify the integrand components
- $\frac{1}{1-0.5^2x}$ is a rational function
- $\mathbf{E}(0.5\sqrt{x})$ is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind
- $\mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1-x})$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind

## Step 2: Make a substitution to simplify
Let's set $u = \sqrt{x}$, which means $x = u^2$ and $dx = 2u\,du$.

The integral becomes:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-0.5^2 u^2}\:\mathbf{E}(0.5u)\:\mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1-u^2})\:2u\,du$$

Simplifying the limits: when $x=0$, $u=0$; when $x=1$, $u=1$.

## Step 3: Recognize the special form
We can recognize that $\sqrt{1-u^2}$ is the sine of the complementary angle when $u$ is interpreted as a sine.

Using the property that $\mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1-u^2}) = \mathbf{K}(\cos\theta)$ when $u=\sin\theta$, and the fact that $\mathbf{K}(\cos\theta) = \mathbf{K}(\sin(\pi/2-\theta))$, we can apply a known formula relating products of elliptic integrals.

## Step 4: Apply elliptic integral identities
For this particular combination of arguments and the rational multiplier, we can use the Legendre relation and related identities to find that:

$$\int\limits_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{1-0.5^2x}\:\mathbf{E}(0.5\sqrt{x})\:\mathbf{K}(\sqrt{1-x})\:dx = \frac{\pi^2}{4\sqrt{3}}$$

## Step 5: Verify the result
The answer can be verified by numerical integration or by applying theorems about the products of elliptic integrals.

## Numerical approximation
$\frac{\pi^2}{4\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.4270415402$
