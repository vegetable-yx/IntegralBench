# Evaluating $\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx$

First, I need to understand what $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ means. This appears to be the Dirac delta function $\delta(0.5x)$.

## Step 1: Understand the properties of the Dirac delta function

The Dirac delta function $\delta(g(x))$ has the property:

$$\int f(x)\delta(g(x))dx = \sum_{i} \frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$$

where $x_i$ are the roots of $g(x)$.

In our case, $g(x) = 0.5x$, which has a root at $x = 0$. But our integration bounds are $[0, 1.0]$, and since $x = 0$ is at the boundary, we need to be careful.

Since $\delta(0.5x) = \frac{1}{0.5}\delta(x) = 2\delta(x)$, we're looking at:

$$\int_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x \cdot 2\delta(x)dx$$

## Step 2: Apply the properties of the Dirac delta function

When $x = 0$ is at the boundary, the integral captures half the value at that point. However, we need to examine what happens to our integrand at $x = 0$.

The function $x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x$ has a potential issue at $x = 0$ because both $x$ and $\ln(x)$ cause problems.

Let's evaluate the limit:
$$\lim_{x \to 0} x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x$$

As $x \to 0$:
- $\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2} \to 1.0$
- $1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2} \to 2.0$
- $\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x \to \ln\frac{2.0}{x} \to \infty$

But $x \to 0$, so we have an indeterminate form $0 \cdot \infty$.

Using L'HÃ´pital's rule, by writing it as:
$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0} x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x$$

After detailed analysis, we find that this limit equals 0. 

## Step 3: Evaluate the integral

Given that the limit of the integrand at $x = 0$ is 0, and the Dirac delta function $\delta(0.5x)$ is only non-zero at $x = 0$, the value of the integral is:

$$\int_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x \cdot 2\delta(x)dx = 0$$

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact result is 0, so the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
