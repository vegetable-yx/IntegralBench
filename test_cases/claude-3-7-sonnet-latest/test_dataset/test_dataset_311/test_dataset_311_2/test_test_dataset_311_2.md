# Calculating $\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx$

First, I need to understand what $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ represents. This appears to be the Dirac delta function $\delta(0.5x)$.

## Step 1: Analyze the integral with the Dirac delta function

When we have an integral containing $\delta(g(x))$, we can use the property:

$$\int f(x) \delta(g(x)) dx = \sum_{i} \frac{f(x_i)}{|g'(x_i)|}$$

where $x_i$ are the roots of $g(x) = 0$.

In our case, $g(x) = 0.5x$, which has a root at $x = 0$.

The derivative $g'(x) = 0.5$.

## Step 2: Apply the Dirac delta function property

Since we're integrating from 0 to 1.0, and the Dirac delta function is non-zero only at $x = 0$, we need to evaluate:

$$\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\delta(0.5x)dx = \frac{f(0)}{|g'(0)|} = \frac{0 \cdot \ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-0^2}}{0}}{0.5}$$

However, there's an issue here: at $x = 0$, the term $\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}{x}$ is undefined because we have $\ln(1/0)$.

## Step 3: Evaluate the limit as x approaches 0

To resolve this, I need to examine the behavior near $x = 0$.

As $x \to 0$:
- $1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2} \to 1.0+1.0 = 2.0$
- So we have $x\ln\frac{2.0}{x}$

Using L'HÃ´pital's rule or by direct evaluation, as $x \to 0$, $x\ln\frac{2.0}{x} \to 0$ because $x\ln(x) \to 0$ as $x \to 0$.

## Step 4: Final computation

Since $x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}{x} \to 0$ as $x \to 0$, and the Dirac delta function picks out the value at $x = 0$, the integral evaluates to:

$$\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\delta(0.5x)dx = \frac{0}{0.5} = 0$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation

The exact value is 0, so the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
