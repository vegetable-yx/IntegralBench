I'll calculate the definite integral $\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx$.

First, let's understand what $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$ means. This is the Dirac delta function at $0.5x$. When integrated, the Dirac delta function $\mathbf{D}(f(x))$ selects the points where $f(x) = 0$ and evaluates the integrand at those points, divided by $|f'(x)|$.

For $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$, the function $f(x) = 0.5x$ equals zero when $x = 0$. However, our integration starts at $x = 0$, so we need to be careful about including this point.

The derivative $f'(x) = 0.5$, so $|f'(x)| = 0.5$.

Now, for the Dirac delta function $\mathbf{D}(0.5x)$, we get:

$$\int\limits_{0}^{1.0}x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x\:\mathbf{D}\left(0.5x\right)dx = \frac{1}{0.5} \cdot x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x \bigg|_{x=0}$$

Since we're evaluating at $x = 0$, we need to take the limit as $x$ approaches 0:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} 2x\ln\frac{1.0+\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}}x$$

As $x$ approaches 0, $\sqrt{1.0^2-x^2}$ approaches 1.0, so we're looking at:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} 2x\ln\frac{2.0}{x}$$

This can be rewritten as:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} 2x\ln(2.0) - 2x\ln(x)$$

The first term goes to 0 as $x$ approaches 0.

For the second term, we can use L'HÃ´pital's rule or recognize that $\lim_{x \to 0} x\ln(x) = 0$. This is a well-known limit that can be verified by substituting $x = e^{-t}$ as $t$ approaches infinity.

Therefore:
$$\lim_{x \to 0} 2x\ln\frac{2.0}{x} = 0 - 0 = 0$$

So the value of the definite integral is 0.

The numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is 0.0000000000.
