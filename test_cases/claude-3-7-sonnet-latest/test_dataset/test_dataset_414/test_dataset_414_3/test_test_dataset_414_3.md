# Evaluating $\int_{-e}^e\frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}\text{ dx}$

I'll approach this integral by examining the integrand carefully.

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand and its properties

Let's denote the integrand as $f(x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}$.

First, I need to check if the function is odd or even. For an odd function $f(-x) = -f(x)$, and for an even function $f(-x) = f(x)$.

Let's examine the components:
- $e^{-x^{2024}}$ is an even function since $(-x)^{2024} = x^{2024}$ (as 2024 is even)
- $\cos(2024x)$ is an even function since $\cos(-2024x) = \cos(2024x)$
- $\arctan(2024x)$ is an odd function since $\arctan(-2024x) = -\arctan(2024x)$

Therefore, the integrand $f(x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}$ is an odd function.

## Step 2: Apply the property of odd functions in definite integrals

For an odd function $f(x)$, the definite integral $\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0$ when the integration limits are symmetric around zero.

Since we're integrating from $-e$ to $e$, and the integrand is an odd function, we can immediately conclude:

$$\int_{-e}^e\frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}\text{ dx} = 0$$

## Step 3: Verify our result

To double-check our reasoning:
- The function $f(x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}$ has $f(-x) = -f(x)$
- This means the contributions from $[-e,0]$ and $[0,e]$ cancel each other out exactly
- Therefore, the integral equals zero

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact value is 0, and the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is also 0.0000000000.
