# Evaluating $\int_{-e}^e\frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}\text{ dx}$

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand

Let's examine the function $f(x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{\arctan(2024x)}$.

First, I notice that this is an improper integral since $\arctan(2024x)$ is zero when $x = 0$, making the integrand undefined at $x = 0$.

## Step 2: Examine the symmetry of the integrand

Let's check if the integrand has any symmetry properties by examining $f(-x)$:

$f(-x) = \frac{e^{-(-x)^{2024}}\cos(2024(-x))}{\arctan(2024(-x))}$

Since $2024$ is even, $(-x)^{2024} = x^{2024}$, so $e^{-(-x)^{2024}} = e^{-x^{2024}}$

For the cosine term: $\cos(2024(-x)) = \cos(-2024x) = \cos(2024x)$

For the arctangent term: $\arctan(2024(-x)) = \arctan(-2024x) = -\arctan(2024x)$

Therefore:
$f(-x) = \frac{e^{-x^{2024}}\cos(2024x)}{-\arctan(2024x)} = -f(x)$

This means $f(x)$ is an odd function.

## Step 3: Apply the property of odd functions

Since $f(x)$ is odd and we're integrating over the symmetric interval $[-e, e]$:

$\int_{-e}^e f(x) \, dx = 0$

This is because for odd functions, the contributions from the negative and positive parts of the integration interval cancel each other out.

## Step 4: Verify the result

The property of odd functions gives us that $\int_{-a}^a f(x) \, dx = 0$ whenever $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval $[-a, a]$.

We've verified that our integrand is odd, and we're integrating over the symmetric interval $[-e, e]$, so the value of the integral is exactly 0.

## Step 5: Numerical approximation

Since the exact value is 0, the numerical approximation rounded to 10 decimal places is also 0.0000000000.
