# Evaluating $\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor$

I need to evaluate the definite integral with respect to the floor function $\lfloor x\rfloor$.

## Step 1: Understand the integrand and integration variable
The integrand is $f(x) = x^2+1$ and we're integrating with respect to $\lfloor x\rfloor$.

## Step 2: Identify the behavior of $\lfloor x\rfloor$ in the interval $[0,3]$
In the interval $[0,3]$, the floor function $\lfloor x\rfloor$ takes these values:
- For $x \in [0,1)$: $\lfloor x\rfloor = 0$
- For $x \in [1,2)$: $\lfloor x\rfloor = 1$
- For $x \in [2,3]$: $\lfloor x\rfloor = 2$

## Step 3: Express the integral using the properties of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral
For a Riemann-Stieltjes integral with respect to a step function like the floor function, the integral becomes a sum of function values at the jump points, multiplied by the size of the jumps.

At each integer $k$ in our interval, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps by 1. So:

$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = \sum_{k=0}^{2}(k^2+1) \cdot \Delta\lfloor k\rfloor$$

Where $\Delta\lfloor k\rfloor$ is the size of the jump at $k$, which equals 1 for $k = 1, 2$ and equals 0 for $k = 0$ (since $\lfloor x\rfloor$ doesn't jump at $x = 0$ in our interval).

## Step 4: Compute the sum
$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = (1^2+1) \cdot 1 + (2^2+1) \cdot 1$$
$$= 2 + 5 = 7$$

## Step 5: Verify the result
Another way to calculate this is to note that for a function $f$ and a step function $g$ with jumps at points $x_i$ with jump sizes $\Delta g(x_i)$:
$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dg(x) = \sum_{a \leq x_i < b} f(x_i) \Delta g(x_i)$$

In our case:
- $f(x) = x^2+1$
- $g(x) = \lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps at $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ in the interval $[0,3]$
- The jump size is 1 at each point

So:
$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = f(1) \cdot 1 + f(2) \cdot 1 = (1^2+1) + (2^2+1) = 2 + 5 = 7$$

## Numerical Approximation
The exact value is 7, which as a decimal is 7.0000000000.
