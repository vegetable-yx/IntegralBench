# Evaluating $\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor$

I need to evaluate the definite integral with respect to the floor function $\lfloor x\rfloor$.

## Step 1: Understand the integral with respect to the floor function

When we have an integral with respect to $\lfloor x\rfloor$, we need to recognize that $\lfloor x\rfloor$ is a step function that changes values only at integer points. So $\text{d}\lfloor x\rfloor$ represents the jumps in the floor function.

The floor function $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps by 1 at each integer, so:
- At $x = 0$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps from -1 to 0
- At $x = 1$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps from 0 to 1
- At $x = 2$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps from 1 to 2
- At $x = 3$, $\lfloor x\rfloor$ jumps from 2 to 3

## Step 2: Convert to a sum

For an integral with respect to a step function, we can convert it to a sum over the jump points:
$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = \sum_{k=0}^{2} (k^2+1) \cdot 1 + (3^2+1) \cdot 0$$

The last term is zero because the upper limit is exactly at 3, and we don't include the jump at the upper limit.

## Step 3: Evaluate the sum

$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = \sum_{k=0}^{2} (k^2+1)$$

Let's calculate each term:
- For $k=0$: $0^2+1 = 1$
- For $k=1$: $1^2+1 = 2$
- For $k=2$: $2^2+1 = 5$

So the sum is:
$$\int_0^3(x^2+1)\text{ d}\lfloor x\rfloor = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8$$

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact answer is 8, which as a decimal is 8.0000000000 (rounded to 10 decimal places).
