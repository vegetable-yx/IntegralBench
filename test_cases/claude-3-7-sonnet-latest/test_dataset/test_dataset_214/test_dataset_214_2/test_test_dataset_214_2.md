# Evaluating $\int_{0}^{2.0} x^{-1/2}(2.0-x)^{-1/2}\cos\left(1.0\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}\right)dx$

## Step 1: Recognize the structure and make a substitution
Let's examine the integrand: $x^{-1/2}(2.0-x)^{-1/2}\cos\left(1.0\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}\right)$

I notice that $\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}$ appears in the cosine term. Let's set $u = \sqrt{x(2.0-x)}$.

## Step 2: Express $x$ in terms of $u$
From $u = \sqrt{x(2.0-x)} = \sqrt{2.0x - x^2}$

Squaring both sides: $u^2 = 2.0x - x^2 = x(2.0-x)$

This is a key observation because $x(2.0-x)$ appears in our integrand.

## Step 3: Find the relationship between $dx$ and $du$
Differentiating $u^2 = 2.0x - x^2$ with respect to $x$:
$2u\frac{du}{dx} = 2.0 - 2x$

Solving for $\frac{du}{dx}$:
$\frac{du}{dx} = \frac{2.0 - 2x}{2u} = \frac{2.0-x-x}{2u} = \frac{2.0-2x}{2u} = \frac{1.0-x}{u}$

Therefore:
$dx = \frac{u}{1.0-x}du$

## Step 4: Express the limits of integration
When $x = 0$: $u = \sqrt{0 \cdot (2.0-0)} = 0$
When $x = 2.0$: $u = \sqrt{2.0 \cdot (2.0-2.0)} = 0$

So our new limits of integration are from $u = 0$ to $u = 0$. However, this doesn't capture the full domain. 

Looking at $u = \sqrt{x(2.0-x)}$, we see that $u$ increases from $0$ when $x = 0$, reaches a maximum at $x = 1.0$ (where $u = 1.0$), then decreases back to $0$ when $x = 2.0$.

So the integral transforms to:
$\int_{0}^{1.0} (\text{integrand})du + \int_{1.0}^{0} (\text{integrand})du$

## Step 5: Rewrite the integral in terms of $u$
We need to express $x^{-1/2}(2.0-x)^{-1/2}$ in terms of $u$.

From the relation $u^2 = x(2.0-x)$, we can solve for $x$:
$x^2 - 2.0x + u^2 = 0$

Using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{2.0 \pm \sqrt{4.0 - 4u^2}}{2} = 1.0 \pm \sqrt{1.0 - u^2}$

For the range $0 \leq x \leq 1.0$, we have $x = 1.0 - \sqrt{1.0 - u^2}$
For the range $1.0 \leq x \leq 2.0$, we have $x = 1.0 + \sqrt{1.0 - u^2}$

Additionally, $2.0-x = 1.0 \mp \sqrt{1.0 - u^2}$ for the respective ranges.

## Step 6: Simplify and solve
For both ranges, we can compute:
$x^{-1/2}(2.0-x)^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x(2.0-x)}} = \frac{1}{u}$

Now our integral becomes:
$\int_{0}^{1.0} \frac{1}{u}\cos(1.0u)\frac{u}{1.0-x}du + \int_{1.0}^{0} \frac{1}{u}\cos(1.0u)\frac{u}{1.0-x}du$

This simplifies to:
$\int_{0}^{1.0} \cos(1.0u)du = [\sin(1.0u)]_{0}^{1.0} = \sin(1.0) - \sin(0) = \sin(1.0)$

The final answer is $\sin(1.0)$.

## Step 7: Calculate the numerical approximation
$\sin(1.0) \approx 0.8414709848$
