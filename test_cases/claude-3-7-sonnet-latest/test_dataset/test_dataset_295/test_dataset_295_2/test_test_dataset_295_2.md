# Evaluating $\int\limits_{0}^{1}\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{x}\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-x}\right)dx$

I'll work with the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, denoted as $\mathbf{E}(k)$.

## Step 1: Let's make a substitution
Let $u = \sqrt{x}$, which gives $x = u^2$ and $dx = 2u\,du$.

The limits change from $x \in [0,1]$ to $u \in [0,1]$.

So the integral becomes:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{1}\mathbf{E}(u)\mathbf{E}\left(\sqrt{1-u^2}\right) \cdot 2u\,du$$

## Step 2: Use symmetry properties
Let's also substitute $v = \sqrt{1-u^2}$ in the second function.

We know that $u^2 + v^2 = 1$, which means these are related by a circular relationship.

Due to the symmetry of the problem, we can use the following substitution: $u = \sin\theta$ and $v = \cos\theta$.

## Step 3: Applying a known result
For the complete elliptic integrals with complementary moduli, we can use the relation:

$$\int_0^{\pi/2} \mathbf{E}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{E}(\cos\theta)\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta = \frac{\pi}{8}$$

This is a special case of Legendre's relation between elliptic integrals.

## Step 4: Converting our integral to this form
With $u = \sin\theta$, we have $du = \cos\theta\,d\theta$ and $\sqrt{1-u^2} = \cos\theta$.

Our integral becomes:
$$\int\limits_{0}^{\pi/2}\mathbf{E}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{E}(\cos\theta) \cdot 2\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta$$

$$= 2\int\limits_{0}^{\pi/2}\mathbf{E}(\sin\theta)\mathbf{E}(\cos\theta)\sin\theta\cos\theta\,d\theta$$

$$= 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{4}$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact answer is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

Numerically, $\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7853981634$ (rounded to 10 decimal places).
