# Evaluating $\int_0^{2018\pi}\left|\sin(2018x)\right|dx$

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand
I need to integrate $|\sin(2018x)|$ over the interval $[0, 2018\pi]$.

The function $|\sin(2018x)|$ has period $\pi/2018$ (since $\sin(2018x)$ has period $2\pi/2018$).

## Step 2: Understand the behavior over one period
Over one period $[0, \pi/2018]$, $\sin(2018x)$ completes one full cycle from 0 to 0. Due to the absolute value, the function $|\sin(2018x)|$ is non-negative, and its integral over one period is:

$$\int_0^{\pi/2018}|\sin(2018x)|dx = \int_0^{\pi/2018}\sin(2018x)dx = \left[-\frac{1}{2018}\cos(2018x)\right]_0^{\pi/2018}$$

$$= -\frac{1}{2018}\cos(2018 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2018}) + \frac{1}{2018}\cos(0)$$

$$= -\frac{1}{2018}\cos(\pi) + \frac{1}{2018} = -\frac{1}{2018}(-1) + \frac{1}{2018} = \frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}$$

## Step 3: Calculate the number of complete periods
The interval $[0, 2018\pi]$ contains exactly $2018\pi \div \frac{\pi}{2018} = 2018^2$ complete periods.

## Step 4: Compute the full integral
Since we have $2018^2$ complete periods, and the integral over each period is $\frac{1}{1009}$, the total integral is:

$$\int_0^{2018\pi}|\sin(2018x)|dx = 2018^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1009} = \frac{2018^2}{1009} = \frac{4072324}{1009} = 4036$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact answer is $4036$, which as a decimal is exactly $4036.0000000000$.
