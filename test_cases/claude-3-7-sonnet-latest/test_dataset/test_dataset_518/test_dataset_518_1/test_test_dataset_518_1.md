# Evaluating $\int_0^{2018\pi}\left|\sin(2018x)\right|dx$

## Step 1: Analyze the integrand $|\sin(2018x)|$

First, I need to understand the behavior of $|\sin(2018x)|$:
- $\sin(2018x)$ has a period of $\frac{2\pi}{2018}$
- $|\sin(2018x)|$ has a period of $\frac{\pi}{2018}$ (half the period of sine)
- Over one period of $|\sin(2018x)|$, the integral equals $\frac{2}{2018}$

## Step 2: Determine how many complete periods exist in $[0, 2018\pi]$

The number of complete periods in the interval $[0, 2018\pi]$ is:
$\frac{2018\pi}{\frac{\pi}{2018}} = 2018^2$

## Step 3: Calculate the integral

For a single period of $|\sin(2018x)|$ from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2018}$:
$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}}|\sin(2018x)|dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}}\sin(2018x)dx = \frac{1}{2018}[-\cos(2018x)]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2018}} = \frac{1}{2018}[(-\cos(\pi)) - (-\cos(0))] = \frac{1}{2018}[1 + 1] = \frac{2}{2018} = \frac{1}{1009}$

Since we have $2018^2$ complete periods, the definite integral is:
$\int_0^{2018\pi}|\sin(2018x)|dx = 2018^2 \cdot \frac{1}{1009} = \frac{2018^2}{1009} = \frac{4072324}{1009} = 4036$

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact result is $4036$, which as a decimal is $4036.0000000000$
