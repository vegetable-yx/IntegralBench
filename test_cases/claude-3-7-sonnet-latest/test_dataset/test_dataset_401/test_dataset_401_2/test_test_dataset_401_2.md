# Evaluating $\int_0^1|1-|1-|1-x|||\text{ dx}$

To evaluate this integral, I need to work from the innermost absolute value outward, identifying the regions where the expression changes sign.

## Step 1: Analyze $|1-x|$
First, let's determine where $1-x$ changes sign:
- For $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x \geq 0$ when $x \leq 1$
- So in our interval, $|1-x| = 1-x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$

## Step 2: Analyze $|1-|1-x||$
Now I need to determine where $1-|1-x| = 1-(1-x) = x$ changes sign:
- For $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-|1-x| = 1-(1-x) = x$
- This is always positive in our interval, so $|1-|1-x|| = x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$

## Step 3: Analyze $|1-|1-|1-x|||$
Finally, I need to determine where $1-|1-|1-x|| = 1-x$ changes sign:
- For $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-|1-|1-x|| = 1-x$
- This changes sign at $x = 1$, but since we're integrating from $0$ to $1$, we have:
  - For $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x \geq 0$
  - So $|1-|1-|1-x||| = 1-x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$

## Step 4: Evaluate the integral
Now I can compute the integral directly:
$$\int_0^1|1-|1-|1-x|||\text{ dx} = \int_0^1 (1-x)\text{ dx} = \left[x - \frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(0 - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact value is $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, which rounded to 10 decimal places is $0.5000000000$.
