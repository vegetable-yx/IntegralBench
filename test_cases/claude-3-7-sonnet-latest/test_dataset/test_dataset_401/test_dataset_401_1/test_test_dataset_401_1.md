# Calculating $\int_0^1|1-|1-|1-x|||\text{ dx}$

I'll work through this integral by analyzing the nested absolute value expressions from innermost to outermost.

## Step 1: Analyze $|1-x|$
First, let's determine where $1-x$ changes sign:
- For $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x \geq 0$ when $x \leq 1$, and $1-x < 0$ when $x > 1$
- Since our integration domain is $[0,1]$, we have $1-x \geq 0$ for all $x$ in this interval
- Therefore, $|1-x| = 1-x$ for all $x \in [0,1]$

## Step 2: Analyze $|1-|1-x||$
Now we have $|1-(1-x)| = |x|$
- Since $x \geq 0$ for $x \in [0,1]$, we have $|x| = x$ for all $x \in [0,1]$
- Therefore, $|1-|1-x|| = |x| = x$ for all $x \in [0,1]$

## Step 3: Analyze $|1-|1-|1-x|||$
Now we have $|1-x|$ for $x \in [0,1]$
- $1-x = 0$ when $x = 1$
- So $1-x > 0$ when $0 \leq x < 1$ and $1-x = 0$ when $x = 1$
- Therefore, $|1-x| = 1-x$ for $x \in [0,1]$

This means the integral becomes:
$$\int_0^1 |1-x| \, dx = \int_0^1 (1-x) \, dx$$

## Step 4: Compute the integral
$$\int_0^1 (1-x) \, dx = \left[ x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(0 - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation
The numerical value of $\frac{1}{2}$ is $0.5000000000$ when rounded to 10 decimal places.
