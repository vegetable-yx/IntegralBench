# Evaluating $\int_0^1|1-|1-|1-x|||\text{ dx}$

To solve this integral, I'll carefully analyze the nested absolute value expressions from the innermost to the outermost.

## Step 1: Analyze $|1-x|$
First, let's determine when $1-x$ is positive or negative:
- When $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x \geq 0$
- When $x > 1$: $1-x < 0$

Since our integration range is $[0,1]$, we have $|1-x| = 1-x$ for the entire interval.

## Step 2: Analyze $|1-|1-x||$
Now we need to determine the sign of $1-|1-x| = 1-(1-x) = x$:
- When $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $x \geq 0$

So $|1-|1-x|| = |x| = x$ for the entire interval $[0,1]$.

## Step 3: Analyze $|1-|1-|1-x|||$
Finally, we need to determine the sign of $1-|1-|1-x|| = 1-x$:
- When $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x \geq 0$ when $x \leq 1$
- When $0 \leq x \leq 1$: $1-x < 0$ when $x > 1$

Since $x \leq 1$ in our integration range, we have $|1-|1-|1-x||| = 1-x$ for the entire interval.

## Step 4: Calculate the integral
Now we can evaluate the integral:

$$\int_0^1|1-|1-|1-x|||\text{ dx} = \int_0^1(1-x)\text{ dx} = \left[x - \frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^1 = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) - \left(0 - 0\right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

## Step 5: Numerical approximation
The exact answer is $\frac{1}{2}$, which as a decimal is $0.5000000000$ (rounded to 10 decimal places).
