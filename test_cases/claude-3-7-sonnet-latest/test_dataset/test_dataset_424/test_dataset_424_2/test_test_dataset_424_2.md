# Evaluating $\int_{-2023}^{2023}\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\text{ dx}$

## Step 1: Analyze the properties of the integrand

Let's denote the integrand as $f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}$. 

First, note that $f(-x) = \frac{\sin(-x)}{(-x)^2+1} = \frac{-\sin(x)}{x^2+1} = -f(x)$, so $f(x)$ is an odd function.

For an odd function, we know that $\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) \, dx = 0$ for any value of $a$ where the integral exists.

## Step 2: Apply the odd function property

Since we're integrating over the symmetric interval $[-2023, 2023]$ and $f(x)$ is an odd function:

$$\int_{-2023}^{2023}\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2+1}\text{ dx} = 0$$

## Step 3: Verification

We can verify this is correct because for every point $x \in [-2023, 2023]$, the contribution of $f(x)$ is exactly canceled by the contribution of $f(-x)$.

## Step 4: Numerical approximation

The exact value is 0, so the numerical approximation to 10 decimal places is 0.0000000000.
