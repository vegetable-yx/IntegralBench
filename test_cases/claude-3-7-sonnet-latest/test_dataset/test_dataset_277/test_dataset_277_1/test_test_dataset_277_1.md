# Evaluating $\intop_0^2 x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}\cosh\left(1\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right)dx$

I'll solve this definite integral by finding a suitable substitution to simplify the expression.

## Step 1: Analyze the structure of the integral

Let's examine the integrand: $x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}\cosh\left(1\sqrt{x(2-x)}\right)$

Notice that $\sqrt{x(2-x)}$ appears in the argument of $\cosh$. This suggests we should make a substitution involving this expression.

## Step 2: Make a substitution

Let's set $u = \sqrt{x(2-x)}$. To find the relationship between $x$ and $u$, we have:
$u^2 = x(2-x) = 2x - x^2$

This means $x^2 - 2x + u^2 = 0$

Using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4-4u^2}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1-u^2}$

Since $x$ ranges from 0 to 2, and $u = \sqrt{x(2-x)}$ is non-negative, we can determine that:
$x = 1 - \sqrt{1-u^2}$ when $x < 1$
$x = 1 + \sqrt{1-u^2}$ when $x > 1$

Also note that when $x = 0$, $u = 0$, and when $x = 2$, $u = 0$ as well.
When $x = 1$, $u = 1$.

So as $x$ goes from 0 to 2, $u$ goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0.

## Step 3: Calculate $dx$ in terms of $du$

From $u^2 = x(2-x)$, we can implicitly differentiate:
$2u \cdot du = (2-x) - x \cdot dx = 2 - 2x \cdot dx$

Therefore:
$dx = \frac{2u \cdot du}{2 - 2x} = \frac{u \cdot du}{1-x}$

## Step 4: Express the integrand in terms of $u$

We need to find $x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}$ in terms of $u$.

From $u^2 = x(2-x)$, we get:
$x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2} = \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{2-x} = u$

And $\cosh(1 \cdot \sqrt{x(2-x)}) = \cosh(u)$

## Step 5: Rewrite the integral

The integral becomes:
$\intop_0^2 x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2}\cosh(u) \cdot \frac{u \cdot du}{1-x}$

But since $x^{1/2}(2-x)^{1/2} = u$, we have:
$\intop_0^2 u \cdot \cosh(u) \cdot \frac{u \cdot du}{1-x}$

We need to express $1-x$ in terms of $u$. Using our substitution results:
When $x < 1$: $1-x = \sqrt{1-u^2}$
When $x > 1$: $1-x = -\sqrt{1-u^2}$

## Step 6: Split the integral

Due to the behavior of $u$ as $x$ goes from 0 to 2, we need to split the integral into two parts:
- From $x=0$ to $x=1$, $u$ increases from 0 to 1
- From $x=1$ to $x=2$, $u$ decreases from 1 to 0

$\intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du + \intop_1^2 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{-\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du$

For the second part, as $x$ goes from 1 to 2, $u$ goes from 1 to 0, so $du$ is negative. Accounting for this and the negative in the denominator:

$\intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du + \intop_1^0 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot (-du)$

$= \intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du + \intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du$

$= 2 \cdot \intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du$

## Step 7: Evaluate the integral

Let's compute $\intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du$

We know that $\cosh(u) = \frac{e^u + e^{-u}}{2}$

So the integral becomes:
$\intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot (e^u + e^{-u})}{2\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du$

Recalling that $\sinh(u) = \frac{e^u - e^{-u}}{2}$ and $\sinh'(u) = \cosh(u)$, we can use integration by parts to solve this.

However, a more direct approach is to recognize this is related to a modified Bessel function.

Using properties of modified Bessel functions, we can determine that:
$\intop_0^1 \frac{u^2 \cdot \cosh(u)}{\sqrt{1-u^2}} \cdot du = \pi \cdot I_1(1)$

Where $I_1(1)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 1, evaluated at 1.

## Step 8: Calculate the final result

Therefore, our original integral equals:
$2 \cdot \pi \cdot I_1(1) = 2\pi \cdot I_1(1)$

The value of $I_1(1) \approx 0.5651591039924850$, which means:
$2\pi \cdot I_1(1) \approx 2\pi \cdot 0.5651591039924850 \approx 3.5505245785485430$

## Final Answer

The exact answer is $2\pi I_1(1)$, where $I_1(1)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order 1, evaluated at 1.

The numerical approximation, rounded to 10 decimal places, is 3.5505245785.
